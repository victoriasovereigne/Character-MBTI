<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>Down the Rabbit-Hole


<p/>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister
on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
peeped into the book her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,<div class="bookquote">''
thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was considering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own mind -LRB-as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could,
for the hot day made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feel very sleepy and stupid-RRB-, whether
the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!'' -LRB-when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought
it over afterwards, it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ought to have
wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural-RRB-;
but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet, for it flashed across her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

<p/>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
considering how in the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was to get out again.

<p/>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself
falling down a very deep well.

<p/>Either the well was very deep, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fell very slowly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had plenty of time as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went down to look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and to
wonder what was going to happen next. First, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried to look
down and make out what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was coming to, but it was too dark to
see anything; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
here and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) passed; it was
labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) great disappointment it
was empty: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
fell past it.

<p/>`Well!<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll
all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,
even if I fell off the top of the house!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Which was very likely
true.-RRB-

<p/>Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I
wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said aloud.
`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let
me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' -LRB-for,
you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good
opportunity for showing off her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knowledge, as there was no one to
listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), still it was good practice to say it over-RRB- `--yes,
that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I've got to?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Alice had no idea what Latitude was,
or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
say.-RRB-

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right
THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the
people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I
think--' -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this
time, as it didn't sound at all the right word-RRB- `--but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?<div class="bookquote">'' -LRB-and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried
to curtsey as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
through the air! Do you think you could manage it?-RRB- `And what
an ignorant little girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll think me for asking! No, it'll
never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I
should think!<div class="bookquote">'' -LRB-Dinah was the cat.-RRB- `I hope they'll remember
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were
down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but
you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.
But do cats eat bats, I wonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And here Alice began to get
rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?<div class="bookquote">'' and sometimes, `Do
bats eat cats?''  (<font color='red'><b>cats</b></font>)</div>for, you see, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) couldn't answer either
question, it didn't much matter which way she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) very
earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a
bat?'' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) came upon a heap of
sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

<p/>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) jumped up on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet in a
moment: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:
away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it
say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late
it's getting!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was close behind it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) turned the
corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
hanging from the roof.

<p/>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
other, trying every door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked sadly down the middle,
wondering how she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was ever to get out again.

<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came upon a little three-legged table, all made of
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the
doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or
the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of
them. However, on the second time round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came upon a low
curtain she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not noticed before, and behind it was a little
door about fifteen inches high: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried the little golden key
in the lock, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) great delight it fitted!

<p/>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knelt down and
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not even get her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head though the doorway; `and even if
my head would go through,<div class="bookquote">'' thought poor Alice, `it would be of
very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish
I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
know how to begin.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible.

<p/>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
went back to the table, half hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might find another key on
it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
telescopes: this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found a little bottle on it, -LRB-`which
certainly was not here before,'' said Alice,-RRB- and round the neck
of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'
beautifully printed on it in large letters.

<p/>It was all very well to say `Drink me,<div class="bookquote">'' but the wise little
Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look
first,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, `and see whether it's marked <div class="bookquote">``poison''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>or not';
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had read several nice little histories about children who
had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules
their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker
will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
`poison,'' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or
later.

<p/>However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,'' so Alice ventured
to taste it, and finding it very nice, -LRB-it had, in fact, a sort
of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) very soon finished
it off.

<p/>* * * * * * *

<p/>* * * * * *

<p/>* * * * * * *

<p/>`What a curious feeling!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice; `I must be shutting up
like a telescope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so it was indeed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now only ten inches high, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face brightened up at the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now the right
size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.
First, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waited for a few minutes to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
going to shrink any further: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt a little nervous about
this; `for it might end, you know,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice to herself, `in my
going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be
like then?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is
like after the candle is blown out, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not remember
ever having seen such a thing.

<p/>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) decided
on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got to the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had forgotten the
little golden key, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went back to the table for it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not possibly reach it: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could see it
quite plainly through the glass, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) best to climb
up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had tired herself out with trying,
the poor little thing sat down and cried.

<p/>`Come, there's no use in crying like that!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice to
herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) generally gave herself very good advice, -LRB-though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) very
seldom followed it-RRB-, and sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) scolded herself so
severely as to bring tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes; and once she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered
trying to box her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own ears for having cheated herself in a game
of croquet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was playing against herself, for this curious
child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no
use now,<div class="bookquote">'' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,
there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
person!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
the table: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on
which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.
`Well, I'll eat it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,
I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I
don't care which happens!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which
way? Which way?'', holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand on the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head to
feel which way it was growing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite surprised to
find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remained the same size: to be sure, this generally
happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the
way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
common way.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>The Pool of Tears


<p/>`Curiouser and curiouser!<div class="bookquote">'' cried Alice -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was so much
surprised, that for the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) quite forgot how to speak good
English-RRB-; `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that
ever was! Good-bye, feet!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so
far off-RRB-. `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't
be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be
kind to them,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the
way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of
boots every Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on planning to herself how she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would manage it.
`They must go by the carrier,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought; `and how funny it'll
seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the
directions will look!

<p/>ALICE``S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ..
HEARTHRUG,
NEAR THE FENDER,
-LRB-WITH ALICE<div class="bookquote">``S LOVE-RRB-.

<p/>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Just then her (<font color='blue'><b>ALICE</b></font>) head struck against the roof of the hall: in
fact she (<font color='blue'><b>ALICE</b></font>) was now more than nine feet high, and she (<font color='blue'><b>ALICE</b></font>) at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.

<p/>Poor Alice! It was as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could do, lying down on one
side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get
through was more hopeless than ever: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat down and began to
cry again.

<p/>`You ought to be ashamed of yourself,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, `a great
girl like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might well say this-RRB-, `to go on crying in
this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on all
the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool
all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), about four inches deep and reaching half down the
hall.

<p/>After a time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard a little pattering of feet in the
distance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hastily dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes to see what was coming.
It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
other: he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)
be savage if I've kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) waiting!'' Alice felt so desperate
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
came near her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,
sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid
gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard
as he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) could go.

<p/>Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very
hot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) kept fanning herself all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on talking:
`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday
things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in
the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this
morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little
different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in
the world am I? Ah, THAT<div class="bookquote">``S the great puzzle!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began
thinking over all the children she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew that were of the same age
as herself, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could have been changed for any of
them.

<p/>`I'm sure I'm not Ada,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said, `for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hair goes in such
long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm
sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>),
oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) knows such a very little! Besides, SHE``S she (<font color='blue'><b>ALICE</b></font>), and I'm I,
and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the
things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,
and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!
I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the
Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,
and Rome--no, THAT``S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! I'll try and say <div class="bookquote">``How doth the little--'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) lap as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) were saying lessons,
and began to repeat it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) voice sounded hoarse and
strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--

<p/>`How doth the little crocodile
Improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
On every golden scale!

<p/>`How cheerfully he (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) seems to grin,
How neatly spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) claws,
And welcome little fishes in
With gently smiling jaws!''

<p/>`I'm sure those are not the right words,'' said poor Alice, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes filled with tears again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on, `I must be Mabel
after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so
many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm
Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their
heads down and saying ``Come up again, dear!'' I shall only look
up and say ``Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I
like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down
here till I'm somebody else<div class="bookquote">''--but, oh dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>cried Alice, with a
sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads
down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!''

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands, and was
surprised to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had put on one of the Rabbit's little
white kid gloves while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was talking. `How CAN I have done
that?<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought. `I must be growing small again.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got up
and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,
as nearly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could guess, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now about two feet high,
and was going on shrinking rapidly: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon found out that the
cause of this was the fan she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was holding, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dropped it
hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

<p/>`That WAS a narrow escape!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, a good deal frightened at
the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
existence; `and now for the garden!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran with all speed
back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut
again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
before, `and things are worse than ever,<div class="bookquote">'' thought the poor child,
`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare
it's too bad, that it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said these words her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) foot slipped, and in another
moment, splash! she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chin in salt water. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first
idea was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that
case I can go back by railway,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself. -LRB-Alice had
been to the seaside once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life, and had come to the general
conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find
a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in
the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and
behind them a railway station.-RRB- However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon made out that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was in the pool of tears which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had wept when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was nine
feet high.

<p/>`I wish I hadn't cried so much!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) swam about,
trying to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I
suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer
thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard something splashing about in the pool a
little way off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) swam nearer to make out what it was: at
first she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered how small she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon made out that
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

<p/>`Would it be of any use, now,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice, `to speak to this
mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should
think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in
trying.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of
this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!<div class="bookquote">''
-LRB-Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never done such a thing before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered having
seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a
mouse--a mouse--O mouse!''  (<font color='red'><b>O Mouse</b></font>)</div>The Mouse looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to wink with one of its little
eyes, but it said nothing.

<p/>`Perhaps it doesn't understand English,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice; `I
daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the
Conqueror.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>-LRB-For, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knowledge of history, Alice had
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.-RRB- So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
began again: `Ou est ma chatte?<div class="bookquote">'' which was the first sentence in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the
water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg
your pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried Alice hastily, afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had hurt the
poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.''

<p/>`Not like cats!<div class="bookquote">'' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate
voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>cats</b></font>)</div><p/>`Well, perhaps not,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be
angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:
I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is such a dear quiet thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice went on, half to herself,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) swam lazily about in the pool, `and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sits purring so
nicely by the fire, licking her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) paws and washing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face--and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s such a capital
one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!<div class="bookquote">'' cried Alice again,
for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt
certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) any
more if you'd rather not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`We indeed!<div class="bookquote">'' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end
of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family
always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear
the name again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I won't indeed!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the
subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is
such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!
A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly
brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and
it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I
can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!
He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!<div class="bookquote">'' cried Alice in a
sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>For the
Mouse was swimming away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as hard as it could go, and
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back
again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't
like them!<div class="bookquote">'' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam
slowly back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): its face was quite pale -LRB-with passion, Alice
thought-RRB-, and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to
the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll
understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cats dogs</b></font>)</div><p/>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded
with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a
Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious
creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the
shore.



<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale


<p/>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the
bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their
fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and
uncomfortable.

<p/>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they
had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed
quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with
them, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had known them all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,
and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';
and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,
and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no
more to be said.

<p/>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among
them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I<div class="bookquote">``LL
soon make you dry enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>They all sat down at once, in a large
ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes
anxiously fixed on it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would catch a bad
cold if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not get dry very soon.

<p/>`Ahem!'' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?
This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!
<div class="bookquote">``William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was
soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and
Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--'' (<font color='red'><b>Ugh</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`Ugh!'' said the Lory, with a shiver.

<p/>`I beg your pardon!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mouse, frowning, but very
politely: `Did you speak?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Not I!'' said the Lory hastily.

<p/>`I thought you did,'' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. <div class="bookquote">``Edwin and
Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edwin</b></font>):
and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found
it advisable--'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`Found WHAT?'' said the Duck.

<p/>`Found IT,'' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you
know what ``it<div class="bookquote">'' means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I know what <div class="bookquote">``it''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>means well enough, when I find a thing,<div class="bookquote">'' said
the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,
what did the archbishop find?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,
`<div class="bookquote">''--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William
and offer him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) the crown. William's conduct at first was
moderate. But the insolence of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) Normans--''  (<font color='red'><b>The Mouse</b></font>)</div>How are you
getting on now, my dear?'' it continued, turning to Alice as it
spoke.

<p/>`As wet as ever,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't
seem to dry me at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`In that case,'' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I
move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies--'

<p/>`Speak English!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of
half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do
either!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:
some of the other birds tittered audibly.

<p/>`What I was going to say,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Dodo in an offended tone,
`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`What IS a Caucus-race?'' said Alice; not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wanted much
to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

<p/>`Why,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter
day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.-RRB-

<p/>First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, -LRB-`the
exact shape doesn't matter,<div class="bookquote">'' it said,-RRB- and then all the party
were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,
two, three, and away,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but they began running when they liked,
and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know
when the race was over. However, when they had been running half
an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called
out `The race is over!<div class="bookquote">'' and they all crowded round it, panting,
and asking, `But who has won?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)</div><p/>This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
its forehead -LRB-the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
in the pictures of him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)-RRB-, while the rest waited in silence. At
last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have
prizes.''

<p/>`But who is to give the prizes?'' quite a chorus of voices
asked.

<p/>`Why, SHE, of course,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with
one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, -LRB-luckily the salt
water had not got into it-RRB-, and handed them round as prizes.
There was exactly one a-piece all round.

<p/>`But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must have a prize herself, you know,'' said the Mouse.

<p/>`Of course,<div class="bookquote">'' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have
you got in your pocket?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on, turning to Alice.

<p/>`Only a thimble,'' said Alice sadly.

<p/>`Hand it over here,'' said the Dodo.

<p/>Then they all crowded round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) once more, while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short
speech, they all cheered.

<p/>Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked
so grave that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not dare to laugh; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not
think of anything to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) simply bowed, and took the thimble,
looking as solemn as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could.

<p/>The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise
and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again
in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

<p/>`You promised to tell me your history, you know,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice,
`and why it is you hate--C and D,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) added in a whisper, half
afraid that it would be offended again.

<p/>`Mine is a long and a sad tale!'' said the Mouse, turning to
Alice, and sighing.

<p/>`It IS a long tail, certainly,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, looking down with
wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) idea of the tale was something like this:--

<p/>`Fury said to a
mouse, That he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
met in the
house,
<div class="bookquote">``Let us
both go to
law: I will
prosecute
YOU. --Come,
I'll take no
denial; We
must have a
trial: For
really this
morning I've
nothing
to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Said the
mouse to the
cur, <div class="bookquote">``Such
a trial,
dear Sir,
With
no jury
or judge,
would be
wasting
our
breath.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll be
judge, I'll
be jury,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Said
cunning
old Fury:
<div class="bookquote">``I'll
try the
whole
cause,
and
condemn
you
to
death.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'


<p/>`You are not attending!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mouse to Alice severely.
`What are you thinking of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I beg your pardon,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to
the fifth bend, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I had NOT!'' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

<p/>`A knot!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and
looking anxiously about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). `Oh, do let me help to undo it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I shall do nothing of the sort,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mouse, getting up
and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I didn't mean it!<div class="bookquote">'' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily
offended, you know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The Mouse only growled in reply.

<p/>`Please come back and finish your story!<div class="bookquote">'' Alice called after
it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>but
the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
quicker.

<p/>`What a pity it wouldn't stay!<div class="bookquote">'' sighed the Lory, as soon as it
was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of
saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lory</b></font>) daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you
never to lose YOUR temper!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`Hold your tongue, Ma!<div class="bookquote">'' said the
young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the
patience of an oyster!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. `She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'d soon fetch it back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?''
said the Lory.

<p/>Alice replied eagerly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was always ready to talk about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s such a capital one for
catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
after the birds! Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'ll eat a little bird as soon as look
at it!''

<p/>This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be
getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!<div class="bookquote">'' and a Canary
called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my
dears! It's high time you were all in bed!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>On various pretexts
they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

<p/>`I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself in a
melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), down here, and I'm
sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I
wonder if I shall ever see you any more!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>And here poor Alice
began to cry again, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt very lonely and low-spirited.
In a little while, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) again heard a little pattering of
footsteps in the distance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked up eagerly, half hoping
that the Mouse had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind, and was coming back to
finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) story.



<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


<p/>It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and
looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!
Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)'ll get me
executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have
dropped them, I wonder?'' Alice guessed in a moment that it was
looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and
the little door, had vanished completely.

<p/>Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went hunting about,
and called out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE
you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of
gloves and a fan! Quick, now!'' And Alice was so much frightened
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without
trying to explain the mistake it had made.

<p/>`He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) took me for his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) housemaid,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) said to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) ran.
`How surprised he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>)'ll be when he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) finds out who I am! But I'd
better take him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) came upon a neat little house, on the door
of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'
engraved upon it. She (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) went in without knocking, and hurried
upstairs, in great fear lest she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) should meet the real Mary Ann,
and be turned out of the house before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) had found the fan and
gloves.

<p/>`How queer it seems,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice said to herself, `to be going
messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on
messages next!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) began fancying the sort of thing that
would happen: `<div class="bookquote">``Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready
for your walk!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see
that the mouse doesn't get out.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Only I don't think,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice went
on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
people about like that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) way into a tidy little room with
a table in the window, and on it -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had hoped-RRB- a fan and two
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) took up the fan and
a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-
glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,<div class="bookquote">''
but nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) uncorked it and put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) lips. `I know
SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said to herself,
`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this
bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for
really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!''

<p/>It did so indeed, and much sooner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had expected:
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had drunk half the bottle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) head pressing
against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) neck from being
broken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself
`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I
can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so
much!''

<p/>Alas! it was too late to wish that! She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went on growing, and
growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in
another minute there was not even room for this, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) tried
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the
other arm curled round her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) head. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went on growing, and,
as a last resource, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) put one arm out of the window, and one
foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,
whatever happens. What WILL become of me?''

<p/>Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,
and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ever getting
out of the room again, no wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt unhappy.

<p/>`It was much pleasanter at home,<div class="bookquote">'' thought poor Alice, `when one
wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that
rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,
this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing
never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There
ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when
I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) added in a
sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more
HERE.''

<p/>`But then,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I
am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--
but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div><p/>`Oh, you foolish Alice!<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answered herself. `How can you
learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no
room at all for any lesson-books!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div><p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on, taking first one side and then the other,
and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few
minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

<p/>`Mary Ann! Mary Ann!<div class="bookquote">'' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves
this moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Ann</b></font>)</div>Then came a little pattering of feet on the
stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) trembled till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shook the house, quite forgetting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no
reason to be afraid of it.

<p/>Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;
but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed
hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it
say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.''

<p/>`THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard the Rabbit just under the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) suddenly
spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, and made a snatch in the air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not
get hold of anything, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard a little shriek and a fall,
and a crash of broken glass, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) concluded that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
of the sort.

<p/>Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are
you?<div class="bookquote">'' And then a voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never heard before, `Sure then
I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Digging for apples, indeed!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!
Come and help me out of THIS!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Sounds of more broken glass.-RRB-

<p/>`Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?''

<p/>`Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!<div class="bookquote">'' -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) pronounced it `arrum.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>`An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it
fills the whole window!''

<p/>`Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.''

<p/>`Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it
away!''

<p/>There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer
honour, at all, at all!<div class="bookquote">'' `Do as I tell you, you coward!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and at
last she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand again, and made another snatch in
the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more
sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there
must be!<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for
pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I
don't want to stay in here any longer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waited for some time without hearing anything more: at
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a
good many voices all talking together: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made out the words:
`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;
Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up
at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half
high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--
Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind
that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!<div class="bookquote">'' -LRB-a loud
crash-RRB---`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go
down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,
then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
go down the chimney!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)?<div class="bookquote">'' said
Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is
narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) foot as far down the chimney as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, and
waited till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard a little animal -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) couldn't guess of what
sort it was-RRB- scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): then, saying to herself `This is Bill,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave one
sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.

<p/>The first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard was a general chorus of `There goes
Bill!<div class="bookquote">'' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>), you by the
hedge!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) head--Brandy now--Don't choke him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)--How was it, old fellow?
What happened to you? Tell us all about it!''

<p/>Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, -LRB-`That's Bill,<div class="bookquote">''
thought Alice,-RRB- `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm
better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know
is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes
like a sky-rocket!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bill</b></font>)</div><p/>`So you did, old fellow!'' said the others.

<p/>`We must burn the house down!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Rabbit's voice; and
Alice called out as loud as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, `If you do. I'll set
Dinah at you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to
herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any
sense, they'd take the roof off.<div class="bookquote">'' After a minute or two, they
began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A
barrowful will do, to begin with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`A barrowful of WHAT?<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not long to
doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the face.
`I'll put a stop to this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, and shouted out,
`You'd better not do that again!'' which produced another dead
silence.

<p/>Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright
idea came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head. `If I eat one of these cakes,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it
can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I
suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began shrinking directly. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was small
enough to get through the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran out of the house, and
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.
The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by
two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) appeared; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
ran off as hard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood.

<p/>`The first thing I've got to do,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
I think that will be the best plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and
simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not the
smallest idea how to set about it; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was peering
about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) look up in a great hurry.

<p/>An enormous puppy was looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with large round
eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
`Poor little thing!'' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried
hard to whistle to it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was terribly frightened all the
time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it
would be very likely to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) up in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) coaxing.

<p/>Hardly knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) picked up a little bit of
stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped
into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,
and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice
dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run
over; and the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) appeared on the other side, the puppy
made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very
like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle
again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long
way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat
down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its
mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

<p/>This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) escape;
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set off at once, and ran till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite tired and out
of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the
distance.

<p/>`And yet what a dear little puppy it was!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself
with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks
very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh
dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let
me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other; but the great question is, what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not see
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
about the same height as herself; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had looked under
it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might as well look and see what was on the top of it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes immediately met those of a large
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,
quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) or of anything else.



<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>Advice from a Caterpillar


<p/>The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth, and addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in a languid, sleepy voice.

<p/>`Who are YOU?'' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice
replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think
I must have been changed several times since then.''

<p/>`What do you mean by that?<div class="bookquote">'' said the Caterpillar sternly.
`Explain yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because
I'm not myself, you see.''

<p/>`I don't see,'' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>`I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice replied very
politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`It isn<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar.

<p/>`Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice; `but
when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you
know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll
feel it a little queer, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Not a bit,'' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>`Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice;
`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`You!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's
making such VERY short remarks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) drew herself up and said,
very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.''

<p/>`Why?'' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not
think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) turned away.

<p/>`Come back!<div class="bookquote">'' the Caterpillar called after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). `I've something
important to say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back
again.

<p/>`Keep your temper,'' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>`Is that all?'' said Alice, swallowing down her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) anger as well as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could.

<p/>`No,'' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>Alice thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might as well wait, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had nothing else
to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) something worth
hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but
at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth
again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?''

<p/>`I'm afraid I am, sir,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice; `I can't remember things as
I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Can't remember WHAT things?'' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>`Well, I've tried to say <div class="bookquote">``HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but it
all came different!'' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

<p/>`Repeat, <div class="bookquote">``YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,'' (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>Alice folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands, and began:--

<p/>`You are old, Father William,<div class="bookquote">'' the young man said,
`And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
Do you think, at your age, it is right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>`In my youth,<div class="bookquote">'' Father William replied to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) son,
`I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div><p/>`You are old,<div class="bookquote">'' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,
And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
Pray, what is the reason of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div><p/>`In my youth,<div class="bookquote">'' said the sage, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pray</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Pray</b></font>) grey locks,
`I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
Allow me to sell you a couple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div><p/>`You are old,<div class="bookquote">'' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
Pray how did you manage to do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div><p/>`In my youth,<div class="bookquote">'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Pray</b></font>) father, `I took to the law,
And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
Has lasted the rest of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div><p/>`You are old,<div class="bookquote">'' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
What made you so awfully clever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I have answered three questions, and that is enough,<div class="bookquote">''
Said his (<font color='blue'><b>Pray</b></font>) father; `don't give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!''


 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`That is not said right,'' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>`Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, timidly; `some of the
words have got altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`It is wrong from beginning to end,'' said the Caterpillar
decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.

<p/>The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

<p/>`What size do you want to be?'' it asked.

<p/>`Oh, I'm not particular as to size,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice hastily replied;
`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I DON<div class="bookquote">``T know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar.

<p/>Alice said nothing: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never been so much contradicted in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) temper.

<p/>`Are you content now?'' said the Caterpillar.

<p/>`Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you
wouldn't mind,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched
height to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`It is a very good height indeed!'' said the Caterpillar
angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke -LRB-it was exactly three
inches high-RRB-.

<p/>`But I'm not used to it!<div class="bookquote">'' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so
easily offended!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`You'll get used to it in time,'' said the Caterpillar; and it
put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

<p/>This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got
down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely
remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and
the other side will make you grow shorter.''

<p/>`One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?'' thought Alice to
herself.

<p/>`Of the mushroom,'' said the Caterpillar, just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

<p/>Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a
minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as
it was perfectly round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found this a very difficult question.
However, at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arms round it as far as they
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.

<p/>`And now which is which?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, and nibbled a
little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt a violent blow underneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chin: it had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
foot!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that there was no time to be lost, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was shrinking
rapidly; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chin was pressed so closely against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) foot, that there was
hardly room to open her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mouth; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did it at last, and
managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.


<p/>* * * * * * *

<p/>* * * * * *

<p/>* * * * * * *

<p/>`Come, my head's free at last!'' said Alice in a tone of
delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
found that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could
see, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked down, was an immense length of neck, which
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
far below her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>`What CAN all that green stuff be?<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice. `And where
HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I
can't see you?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was moving them about as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke, but no
result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the
distant green leaves.

<p/>As there seemed to be no chance of getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head down to them, and was delighted
to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) neck would bend about easily in any direction,
like a serpent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had just succeeded in curving it down into a
graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) draw back in a
hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face, and was beating
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) violently with its wings.

<p/>`Serpent!'' screamed the Pigeon.

<p/>`I'm NOT a serpent!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Serpent, I say again!<div class="bookquote">'' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more
subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every
way, and nothing seems to suit them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,'' said
Alice.

<p/>`I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've
tried hedges,<div class="bookquote">'' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); `but
those serpents! There's no pleasing them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice was more and more puzzled, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought there was no
use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

<p/>`As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,<div class="bookquote">'' said the
Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and
day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,'' said Alice, who was
beginning to see its meaning.

<p/>`And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,<div class="bookquote">'' continued
the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was
thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come
wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!'' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm
a--'

<p/>`Well! WHAT are you?<div class="bookquote">'' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're
trying to invent something!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I--I'm a little girl,'' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
remembered the number of changes she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had gone through that day.

<p/>`A likely story indeed!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Pigeon in a tone of the
deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my
time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a
serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be
telling me next that you never tasted an egg!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, who was a very
truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
serpents do, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I don't believe it,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why
then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This was such a new idea to Alice, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite silent
for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of
adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and
what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a
serpent?''

<p/>`It matters a good deal to ME,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice hastily; `but I'm
not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't
want YOURS: I don't like them raw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Well, be off, then!'' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it
settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the
trees as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) neck kept getting entangled
among the branches, and every now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had to stop and
untwist it. After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) still held the
pieces of mushroom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set to work very
carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and
growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) usual height.

<p/>It was so long since she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been anything near the right size,
that it felt quite strange at first; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got used to it in a
few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,
there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes
are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to
another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next
thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be
done, I wonder?<div class="bookquote">'' As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came suddenly upon an
open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
`Whoever lives there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought Alice, `it'll never do to come
upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their
wits!'' So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did
not venture to go near the house till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had brought herself
down to nine inches high.



<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>Pig and Pepper


<p/>For a minute or two she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood looking at the house, and
wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
running out of the wood---LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) considered him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) to be a footman
because he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was in livery: otherwise, judging by his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) face only,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have called him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) a fish-RRB---and rapped loudly at the door
with his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,
with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,
Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their
heads. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt very curious to know what it was all about, and
crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

<p/>The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) arm a great
letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) handed over to
the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An
invitation from the Queen to play croquet.<div class="bookquote">'' The Frog-Footman
repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the
words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess
to play croquet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled
together.

<p/>Alice laughed so much at this, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had to run back into
the wood for fear of their hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) next peeped
out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the
ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

<p/>Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

<p/>`There's no sort of use in knocking,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Footman, `and
that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the
door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise
inside, no one could possibly hear you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And certainly there was
a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling
and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish
or kettle had been broken to pieces.

<p/>`Please, then,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, `how am I to get in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`There might be some sense in your knocking,<div class="bookquote">'' the Footman went
on without attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), `if we had the door between us. For
instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let
you out, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was looking up into the sky all the time
he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) can't help it,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself; `his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) eyes are so
VERY nearly at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) head. But at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) might
answer questions.--How am I to get in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) repeated, aloud.

<p/>`I shall sit here,'' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'

<p/>At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate
came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just
grazed his (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>) nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>).

<p/>`--or next day, maybe,'' the Footman continued in the same tone,
exactly as if nothing had happened.

<p/>`How am I to get in?'' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

<p/>`ARE you to get in at all?<div class="bookquote">'' said the Footman. `That's the
first question, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.
`It's really dreadful,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) muttered to herself, `the way all the
creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
said, `on and off, for days and days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`But what am I to do?'' said Alice.

<p/>`Anything you like,'' said the Footman, and began whistling.

<p/>`Oh, there's no use in talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice desperately:
`he (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>)'s perfectly idiotic!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) opened the door and went in.

<p/>The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of
smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a
three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was
leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to
be full of soup.

<p/>`There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!'' Alice said to
herself, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could for sneezing.

<p/>There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was
sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,
and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from
ear to ear.

<p/>`Please would you tell me,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, a little timidly, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to
speak first, `why your cat grins like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>`It's a Cheshire cat,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a Cheshire cat</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
quite jumped; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw in another moment that it was addressed
to the baby, and not to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) took courage, and went on
again:--

<p/>`I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I
didn't know that cats COULD grin.''

<p/>`They all can,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I don't know of any that do,'' Alice said very politely,
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.

<p/>`You don't know much,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
conversation. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was trying to fix on one, the cook took
the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work
throwing everything within her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reach at the Duchess and the baby
--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,
plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when
they hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>); and the baby was howling so much already, that it
was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

<p/>`Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!'' cried Alice, jumping up
and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) PRECIOUS
nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very
nearly carried it off.

<p/>`If everybody minded their own business,<div class="bookquote">'' the Duchess said in a
hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it
does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>`Which would NOT be an advantage,'' said Alice, who felt very
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day
and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn
round on its axis--'

<p/>`Talking of axes,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Duchess, `chop off her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) meant
to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and
seemed not to be listening, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on again: `Twenty-four
hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'

<p/>`Oh, don't bother ME,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Duchess; `I never could abide
figures!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And with that she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) began nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) child again,
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) did so, and giving it a
violent shake at the end of every line:

<p/>`Speak roughly to your little boy,
And beat him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sneezes:
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) only does it to annoy,
Because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows it teases.''

<p/>CHORUS.

<p/>-LRB-In which the cook and the baby joined-RRB-:--

<p/>`Wow! wow! wow!''

<p/>While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) kept
tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing
howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--

<p/>`I speak severely to my boy,
I beat him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sneezes;
For he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can thoroughly enjoy
The pepper when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pleases!''

<p/>CHORUS.

<p/>`Wow! wow! wow!''

<p/>`Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!<div class="bookquote">'' the Duchess said
to Alice, flinging the baby at her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) spoke. `I must go and
get ready to play croquet with the Queen,''  (<font color='red'><b>nurse bit</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hurried out of
the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) went out,
but it just missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>).

<p/>Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-
shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all
directions, `just like a star-fish,'' thought Alice. The poor
little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) caught it,
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,
so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could do to hold it.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had made out the proper way of nursing it,
-LRB-which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep
tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its
undoing itself,-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) carried it out into the open air. `IF I
don't take this child away with me,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice, `they're sure
to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it
behind?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said the last words out loud, and the little thing
grunted in reply -LRB-it had left off sneezing by this time-RRB-. `Don't
grunt,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The baby</b></font>)</div><p/>The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into
its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no
doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout
than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for
a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at
all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, and looked
into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.

<p/>No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,
my dear,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do
with you. Mind now!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The poor little thing sobbed again -LRB-or
grunted, it was impossible to say which-RRB-, and they went on for
some while in silence.

<p/>Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I
to do with this creature when I get it home?'' when it grunted
again, so violently, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked down into its face in some
alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was
neither more nor less than a pig, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that it would be
quite absurd for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to carry it further.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to
see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,<div class="bookquote">''
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:
but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began
thinking over other children she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew, who might do very well as
pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right
way to change them--' when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a little startled by seeing
the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.

<p/>The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-
natured, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great
many teeth, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

<p/>`Cheshire Puss,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began, rather timidly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not at
all know whether it would like the name: however, it only
grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>thought
Alice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I
ought to go from here?''

<p/>`That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,'' said
the Cat.

<p/>`I don't much care where--' said Alice.

<p/>`Then it doesn't matter which way you go,'' said the Cat.

<p/>`--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,'' Alice added as an explanation.

<p/>`Oh, you're sure to do that,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Cat, `if you only walk
long enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried another
question. `What sort of people live about here?''

<p/>`In THAT direction,<div class="bookquote">'' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,
`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>waving the other paw,
`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.''

<p/>`But I don't want to go among mad people,'' Alice remarked.

<p/>`Oh, you can't help that,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.
I'm mad. You're mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`How do you know I'm mad?'' said Alice.

<p/>`You must be,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on
`And how do you know that you're mad?''

<p/>`To begin with,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant
that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I suppose so,'' said Alice.

<p/>`Well, then,<div class="bookquote">'' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's
angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm
pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I call it purring, not growling,'' said Alice.

<p/>`Call it what you like,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet
with the Queen to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I should like it very much,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, `but I haven't been
invited yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`You'll see me there,'' said the Cat, and vanished.

<p/>Alice was not much surprised at this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was getting so used
to queer things happening. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was looking at the place
where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.

<p/>`By-the-bye, what became of the baby?<div class="bookquote">'' said the Cat. `I'd
nearly forgotten to ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div><p/>`It turned into a pig,'' Alice quietly said, just as if it had
come back in a natural way.

<p/>`I thought it would,'' said the Cat, and vanished again.

<p/>Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it
did not appear, and after a minute or two she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked on in the
direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen
hatters before,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself; `the March Hare will be
much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be
raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said
this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a
branch of a tree.

<p/>`Did you say pig, or fig?'' said the Cat.

<p/>`I said pig,<div class="bookquote">'' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep
appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`All right,'' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,
which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

<p/>`Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice;
`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever
saw in my life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a cat</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not gone much farther before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came in sight of the
house of the March Hare: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought it must be the right house,
because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was
thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not
like to go nearer till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had nibbled some more of the lefthand
bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself
`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd
gone to see the Hatter instead!''



<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>A Mad Tea-Party


<p/>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a
Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two
were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking
over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice;
`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div><p/>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded
together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!<div class="bookquote">'' they cried
out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said
Alice indignantly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat down in a large arm-chair at one
end of the table.

<p/>`Have some wine,'' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

<p/>Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it
but tea. `I don't see any wine,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remarked.

<p/>`There isn't any,'' said the March Hare.

<p/>`Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,'' said Alice
angrily.

<p/>`It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being
invited,'' said the March Hare.

<p/>`I didn't know it was YOUR table,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice; `it's laid for a
great many more than three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Your hair wants cutting,'' said the Hatter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) had been
looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) first speech.

<p/>`You should learn not to make personal remarks,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice said
with some severity; `it's very rude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Hatter</b></font>)</div><p/>The Hatter opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) eyes very wide on hearing this; but all
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?''

<p/>`Come, we shall have some fun now!<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice. `I'm glad
they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
added aloud.

<p/>`Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?''
said the March Hare.

<p/>`Exactly so,'' said Alice.

<p/>`Then you should say what you mean,'' the March Hare went on.

<p/>`I do,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what
I say--that's the same thing, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Not the same thing a bit!'' said the Hatter. `You might just
as well say that ``I see what I eat'' is the same thing as <div class="bookquote">``I eat
what I see'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>!'

<p/>`You might just as well say,'' added the March Hare, `that ``I
like what I get'' is the same thing as <div class="bookquote">``I get what I like'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>!'

<p/>`You might just as well say,'' added the Dormouse, who seemed to
be talking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) sleep, `that ``I breathe when I sleep'' is the
same thing as <div class="bookquote">``I sleep when I breathe'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>!'

<p/>`It IS the same thing with you,'' said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,
while Alice thought over all she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasn't much.

<p/>The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of
the month is it?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) said, turning to Alice: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>)
watch out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking
it every now and then, and holding it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) ear.

<p/>Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.''

<p/>`Two days wrong!<div class="bookquote">'' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter
wouldn't suit the works!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) added looking angrily at the March
Hare.

<p/>`It was the BEST butter,'' the March Hare meekly replied.

<p/>`Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,<div class="bookquote">'' the Hatter
grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div><p/>The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) dipped it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>)
could think of nothing better to say than his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) first remark, `It
was the BEST butter, you know.''

<p/>Alice had been looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) shoulder with some curiosity.
`What a funny watch!<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remarked. `It tells the day of the
month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Why should it?<div class="bookquote">'' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell
you what year it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Of course not,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice replied very readily: `but that's
because it stays the same year for such a long time together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Which is just the case with MINE,'' said the Hatter.

<p/>Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to
have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
`I don't quite understand you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hatter</b></font>) said, as politely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hatter</b></font>)
could.

<p/>`The Dormouse is asleep again,'' said the Hatter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatter</b></font>) poured
a little hot tea upon its nose.

<p/>The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without
opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to
remark myself.''

<p/>`Have you guessed the riddle yet?'' the Hatter said, turning to
Alice again.

<p/>`No, I give it up,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice replied: `what's the answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I haven't the slightest idea,'' said the Hatter.

<p/>`Nor I,'' said the March Hare.

<p/>Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better
with the time,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, `than waste it in asking riddles that
have no answers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`If you knew Time as well as I do,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Hatter, `you
wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I don't know what you mean,'' said Alice.

<p/>`Of course you don<div class="bookquote">``t!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hatter</b></font>)</div>the Hatter said, tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) head
contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!''

<p/>`Perhaps not,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to
beat time when I learn music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Ah! that accounts for it,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Hatter. `He (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) won't stand
beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>)'d do
almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose
it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:
you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-`I only wish it was,'' the March Hare said to itself in a
whisper.-RRB-

<p/>`That would be grand, certainly,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice thoughtfully:
`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Not at first, perhaps,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Hatter: `but you could keep
it to half-past one as long as you liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Is that the way YOU manage?'' Alice asked.

<p/>The Hatter shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) head mournfully. `Not I!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) replied.
`We quarrelled last March--just before HE (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) went mad, you know--'
-LRB-pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) tea spoon at the March Hare,-RRB- `--it was at the
great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you're at!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>You know the song, perhaps?''

<p/>`I've heard something like it,'' said Alice.

<p/>`It goes on, you know,'' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle--'' (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that
they had to pinch it to make it stop.

<p/>`Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,'' said the Hatter,
`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>)'s murdering the
time! Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>) head!'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`How dreadfully savage!'' exclaimed Alice.

<p/>`And ever since that,<div class="bookquote">'' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,
`he (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so
many tea-things are put out here?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked.

<p/>`Yes, that's it,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always
tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Then you keep moving round, I suppose?'' said Alice.

<p/>`Exactly so,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`But what happens when you come to the beginning again?'' Alice
ventured to ask.

<p/>`Suppose we change the subject,<div class="bookquote">'' the March Hare interrupted,
yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady
tells us a story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I'm afraid I don't know one,'' said Alice, rather alarmed at
the proposal.

<p/>`Then the Dormouse shall!<div class="bookquote">'' they both cried. `Wake up,
Dormouse!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>And they pinched it on both sides at once.

<p/>The Dormouse slowly opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) eyes. `I wasn't asleep,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>)
said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows
were saying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Tell us a story!'' said the March Hare.

<p/>`Yes, please do!'' pleaded Alice.

<p/>`And be quick about it,<div class="bookquote">'' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep
again before it's done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sisters</b></font>)</div><p/>`Once upon a time there were three little sisters,'' the
Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,
Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'

<p/>`What did they live on?'' said Alice, who always took a great
interest in questions of eating and drinking.

<p/>`They lived on treacle,'' said the Dormouse, after thinking a
minute or two.

<p/>`They couldn't have done that, you know,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice gently
remarked; `they'd have been ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`So they were,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways
of living would be like, but it puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) too much, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went
on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?''

<p/>`Take some more tea,'' the March Hare said to Alice, very
earnestly.

<p/>`I've had nothing yet,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so
I can't take more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`You mean you can't take LESS,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Hatter: `it's very
easy to take MORE than nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>`Nobody asked YOUR opinion,'' said Alice.

<p/>`Who's making personal remarks now?'' the Hatter asked
triumphantly.

<p/>Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) helped
herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the
Dormouse, and repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) question. `Why did they live at the
bottom of a well?''

<p/>The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and
then said, `It was a treacle-well.''

<p/>`There's no such thing!<div class="bookquote">'' Alice was beginning very angrily, but
the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>and the Dormouse
sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the
story for yourself.''

<p/>`No, please go on!<div class="bookquote">'' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt
again. I dare say there may be ONE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`One, indeed!'' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>)
consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they
were learning to draw, you know--'

<p/>`What did they draw?'' said Alice, quite forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) promise.

<p/>`Treacle,'' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this
time.

<p/>`I want a clean cup,<div class="bookquote">'' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move
one place on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) moved on as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) spoke, and the Dormouse followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>): the
March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather
unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the
only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a
good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset
the milk-jug into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) plate.

<p/>Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began
very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw
the treacle from?''

<p/>`You can draw water out of a water-well,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Hatter; `so
I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,
stupid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`But they were IN the well,'' Alice said to the Dormouse, not
choosing to notice this last remark.

<p/>`Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.''

<p/>This answer so confused poor Alice, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) let the Dormouse
go on for some time without interrupting it.

<p/>`They were learning to draw,'' the Dormouse went on, yawning and
rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew
all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'

<p/>`Why with an M?'' said Alice.

<p/>`Why not?'' said the March Hare.

<p/>Alice was silent.

<p/>The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going
off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up
again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an
M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--
you know you say things are <div class="bookquote">``much of a muchness'' (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>--did you ever
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?''

<p/>`Really, now you ask me,'' said Alice, very much confused, `I
don't think--'

<p/>`Then you shouldn't talk,'' said the Hatter.

<p/>This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got
up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep
instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
going, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked back once or twice, half hoping that
they would call after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): the last time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw them, they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

<p/>`At any rate I'll never go THERE again!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I
ever was at in all my life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) noticed that one of the trees had a
door leading right into it. `That's very curious!<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought.
`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went.

<p/>Once more she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself in the long hall, and close to the
little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,''
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,
and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went
to work nibbling at the mushroom -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had kept a piece of it
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pocket-RRB- till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was about a foot high: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked down
the little passage: and THEN--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself at last in the
beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>The Queen's Croquet-Ground


<p/>A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the
roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at
it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious
thing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went nearer to watch them, and just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came up
to them she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go
splashing paint over me like that!''

<p/>`I couldn't help it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged
my elbow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always
lay the blame on others!''

<p/>`YOU<div class="bookquote">``D better not talk!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Five. `I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!''

<p/>`What for?'' said the one who had spoken first.

<p/>`That's none of YOUR business, Two!'' said Seven.

<p/>`Yes, it IS his (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) business!<div class="bookquote">'' said Five, `and I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>)--it
was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>Seven flung down his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) brush, and had just begun `Well, of all
the unjust things--' when his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood watching them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) checked himself suddenly: the
others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.

<p/>`Would you tell me,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are
painting those roses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a
low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to
have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;
and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads
cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore
she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously
looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!''
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice
looked round, eager to see the Queen.

<p/>First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped
like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and
feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the
soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were
ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice
recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the
King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

<p/>Alice was rather doubtful whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ought not to lie down on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face like the three gardeners, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not remember
ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,
what would be the use of a procession,<div class="bookquote">'' thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), `if people
had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood still where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was, and waited.

<p/>When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped
and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and the Queen said severely `Who is this?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

<p/>`Idiot!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Queen, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head impatiently; and,
turning to Alice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on, `What's your name, child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Idiot</b></font>)</div><p/>`My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice very
politely; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of
cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div><p/>`And who are THESE?'' said the Queen, pointing to the three
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as
they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs
was the same as the rest of the pack, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) could not tell whether
they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
own children.

<p/>`How should I know?<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own courage.
`It's no business of MINE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head!
Off--'

<p/>`Nonsense!'' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the
Queen was silent.

<p/>The King laid his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arm, and timidly said
`Consider, my dear: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is only a child!''

<p/>The Queen turned angrily away from him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and said to the Knave
`Turn them over!''

<p/>The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

<p/>`Get up!'' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the
three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the
King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.

<p/>`Leave off that!<div class="bookquote">'' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) went on, `What HAVE you
been doing here?''

<p/>`May it please your Majesty,'' said Two, in a very humble tone,
going down on one knee as he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) spoke, `we were trying--'

<p/>`I see!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the
roses. `Off with their heads!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and the procession moved on,
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.

<p/>`You shan't be beheaded!'' said Alice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put them into a
large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered
about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly
marched off after the others.

<p/>`Are their heads off?'' shouted the Queen.

<p/>`Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!'' the soldiers
shouted in reply.

<p/>`That's right!<div class="bookquote">'' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The soldiers</b></font>)</div><p/>The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question
was evidently meant for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>`Yes!'' shouted Alice.

<p/>`Come on, then!'' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the
procession, wondering very much what would happen next.

<p/>`It's--it's a very fine day!'' said a timid voice at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) side.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face.

<p/>`Very,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Hush! Hush!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)
looked anxiously over his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) spoke, and then raised
himself upon tiptoe, put his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) mouth close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ear, and
whispered `She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s under sentence of execution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`What for?'' said Alice.

<p/>`Did you say <div class="bookquote">``What a pity!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?' the Rabbit asked.

<p/>`No, I didn<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.
I said <div class="bookquote">``What for?'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a
little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!'' the Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) came
rather late, and the Queen said--'

<p/>`Get to your places!'' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,
and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up
against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or
two, and the game began. Alice thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never seen such a
curious croquet-ground in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life; it was all ridges and
furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live
flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

<p/>The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
flamingo: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) succeeded in getting its body tucked away,
comfortably enough, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arm, with its legs hanging down,
but generally, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had got its neck nicely straightened
out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it
WOULD twist itself round and look up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face, with such a
puzzled expression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not help bursting out laughing:
and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had got its head down, and was going to begin again,
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
difficult game indeed.

<p/>The players all played at once without waiting for turns,
quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in
a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went
stamping about, and shouting `Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>soldiers</b></font>) head!<div class="bookquote">'' or `Off with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>about once in a minute.

<p/>Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not as
yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) knew that it might
happen any minute, `and then,<div class="bookquote">'' thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), `what would become of
me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great
wonder is, that there's any one left alive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) could get away without being seen, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) noticed a
curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) very much at
first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) made it out to
be a grin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I
shall have somebody to talk to.''

<p/>`How are you getting on?'' said the Cat, as soon as there was
mouth enough for it to speak with.

<p/>Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no
use speaking to it,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, `till its ears have come, or at
least one of them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>In another minute the whole head appeared,
and then Alice put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) flamingo, and began an account of the
game, feeling very glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had someone to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). The
Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and
no more of it appeared.

<p/>`I don't think they play at all fairly,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice began, in rather
a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't
hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in
particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and
you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;
for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next
walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have
croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it
saw mine coming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`How do you like the Queen?'' said the Cat in a low voice.

<p/>`Not at all,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice: `she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s so extremely--' Just then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) noticed that the Queen was close behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), listening: so
she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while
finishing the game.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Queen</b></font>)</div><p/>The Queen smiled and passed on.

<p/>`Who ARE you talking to?'' said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.

<p/>`It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice: `allow me
to introduce it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a Cheshire Cat</b></font>)</div><p/>`I don't like the look of it at all,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King:
`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I'd rather not,'' the Cat remarked.

<p/>`Don't be impertinent,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King, `and don't look at me
like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) got behind Alice as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>`A cat may look at a king,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice. `I've read that in
some book, but I don't remember where.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a king</b></font>)</div><p/>`Well, it must be removed,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King very decidedly, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I
wish you would have this cat removed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Queen</b></font>)</div><p/>The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great
or small. `Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said, without even looking
round.

<p/>`I'll fetch the executioner myself,'' said the King eagerly, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hurried off.

<p/>Alice thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might as well go back, and see how the game
was going on, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard the Queen's voice in the distance,
screaming with passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) had already heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sentence three
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in
such confusion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) never knew whether it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) turn or
not. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) went in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hedgehog.

<p/>The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree.

<p/>By the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had caught the flamingo and brought it back,
the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:
`but it doesn't matter much,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice, `as all the arches
are gone from this side of the ground.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tucked it away
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for
a little more conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got back to the Cheshire Cat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was surprised to
find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute
going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who
were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,
and looked very uncomfortable.

<p/>The moment Alice appeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was appealed to by all three to
settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
though, as they all spoke at once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found it very hard indeed
to make out exactly what they said.

<p/>The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a
head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) had
never had to do such a thing before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) wasn't going to begin
at HIS (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) time of life.

<p/>The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.

<p/>The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about
it in less than no time she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)'d have everybody executed, all round.
-LRB-It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so
grave and anxious.-RRB-

<p/>Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the
Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.''

<p/>`She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)'s in prison,<div class="bookquote">'' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch
her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) here.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And the executioner went off like an arrow.

<p/>The Cat's head began fading away the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) was gone, and,
by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) had come back with the Dutchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.



<p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>The Mock Turtle's Story


<p/>`You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old
thing!'' said the Duchess, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) tucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) arm affectionately
into Alice's, and they walked off together.

<p/>Alice was very glad to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in such a pleasant temper, and
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) so savage when they met in the kitchen.

<p/>`When I<div class="bookquote">``M a Duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, -LRB-not in a very
hopeful tone though-RRB-, `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT
ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that
makes people hot-tempered,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on, very much pleased at
having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them
sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar
and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish
people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you
know--'

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a
little startled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) voice close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) ear.
`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you
forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that
is, but I shall remember it in a bit.''

<p/>`Perhaps it hasn't one,'' Alice ventured to remark.

<p/>`Tut, tut, child!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a
moral, if only you can find it.''  (<font color='red'><b>tut child</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) squeezed herself up
closer to Alice's side as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>Alice did not much like keeping so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): first,
because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was
exactly the right height to rest her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) chin upon Alice's shoulder,
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not
like to be rude, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bore it as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could.

<p/>`The game's going on rather better now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, by way of
keeping up the conversation a little.

<p/>`<div class="bookquote">``Tis so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--<div class="bookquote">``Oh,
`tis love, `tis love, that makes the world go round!'' (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`Somebody said,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody
minding their own business!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>`Ah, well! It means much the same thing,'' said the Duchess,
digging her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) added,
`and the moral of THAT is--<div class="bookquote">``Take care of the sense, and the
sounds will take care of themselves.'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`How fond she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is of finding morals in things!'' Alice thought to
herself.

<p/>`I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your
waist,<div class="bookquote">'' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the
experiment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`HE (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) might bite,'' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all
anxious to have the experiment tried.

<p/>`Very true,'' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both
bite. And the moral of that is--<div class="bookquote">``Birds of a feather flock
together.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`Only mustard isn't a bird,'' Alice remarked.

<p/>`Right, as usual,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you
have of putting things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`It's a mineral, I THINK,'' said Alice.

<p/>`Of course it is,'' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree
to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near
here. And the moral of that is--<div class="bookquote">``The more there is of mine, the
less there is of yours.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`Oh, I know!<div class="bookquote">'' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this
last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I quite agree with you,'' said the Duchess; `and the moral of
that is--``Be what you would seem to be''--or if you'd like it put
more simply--<div class="bookquote">``Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared
to them to be otherwise.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`I think I should understand that better,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice said very
politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it
as you say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,'' the Duchess
replied, in a pleased tone.

<p/>`Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,''
said Alice.

<p/>`Oh, don't talk about trouble!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Duchess. `I make you
a present of everything I've said as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`A cheap sort of present!<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't
give birthday presents like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not venture to
say it out loud.

<p/>`Thinking again?'' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)
sharp little chin.

<p/>`I've a right to think,'' said Alice sharply, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
beginning to feel a little worried.

<p/>`Just about as much right,'' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;
and the m--'

<p/>But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died
away, even in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) favourite word `moral,'' and the
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,
and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arms folded,
frowning like a thunderstorm.

<p/>`A fine day, your Majesty!'' the Duchess began in a low, weak
voice.

<p/>`Now, I give you fair warning,<div class="bookquote">'' shouted the Queen, stamping on
the ground as she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spoke; `either you or your head must be off,
and that in about half no time! Take your choice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The Duchess took her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) choice, and was gone in a moment.

<p/>`Let's go on with the game,'' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice
was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
back to the croquet-ground.

<p/>The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,
and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>),
they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a
moment's delay would cost them their lives.

<p/>All the time they were playing the Queen never left off
quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
head!<div class="bookquote">'' or `Off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head!''  (<font color='red'><b>the players</b></font>)</div>Those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sentenced were
taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave
off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour
or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the
King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of
execution.

<p/>Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to
Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?''

<p/>`No,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div><p/>`It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,'' said the Queen.

<p/>`I never saw one, or heard of one,'' said Alice.

<p/>`Come on, then,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Queen, `and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) shall tell you his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>)
history,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low
voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'' `Come,
THAT<div class="bookquote">``S a good thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had felt quite
unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.

<p/>They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the
sun. -LRB-IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.-RRB-
`Up, lazy thing!'' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to
see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) history. I must go back and
see after some executions I have ordered'; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) walked off,
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like
the look of the creature, but on the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought it would
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
Queen: so she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) waited.

<p/>The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the
Queen till she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!''
said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.

<p/>`What IS the fun?'' said Alice.

<p/>`Why, SHE,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Gryphon. `It's all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fancy, that: they
never executes nobody, you know. Come on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>`Everybody says <div class="bookquote">``come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>here,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went
slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,
never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div><p/>They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,
as they came nearer, Alice could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) sighing as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) heart
would break. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) deeply. `What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) sorrow?<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the
same words as before, `It's all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) fancy, that: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) hasn't got
no sorrow, you know. Come on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div><p/>So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with
large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.

<p/>`This here young lady,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Gryphon, `she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wants for to
know your history, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>This lady</b></font>)</div><p/>`I'll tell it her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow
tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've
finished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice
thought to herself, `I don't see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) can EVEN finish, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>)
doesn't begin.'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waited patiently.

<p/>`Once,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was
a real Turtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only
by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!<div class="bookquote">'' from the Gryphon, and
the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very
nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your
interesting story,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not help thinking there MUST be
more to come, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat still and said nothing.

<p/>`When we were little,'' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more
calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to
school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Tortoise--'

<p/>`Why did you call him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Tortoise, if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wasn't one?'' Alice asked.

<p/>`We called him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Tortoise because he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) taught us,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock
Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>`You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,<div class="bookquote">'' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and
looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At
last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!
Don't be all day about it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) went on in these words:

<p/>`Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe
it--'

<p/>`I never said I didn<div class="bookquote">``t!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>interrupted Alice.

<p/>`You did,'' said the Mock Turtle.

<p/>`Hold your tongue!'' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak
again. The Mock Turtle went on.

<p/>`We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school
every day--'

<p/>`I<div class="bookquote">``VE been to a day-school, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Alice; `you needn't be
so proud as all that.''

<p/>`With extras?'' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

<p/>`Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, `we learned French and music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`And washing?'' said the Mock Turtle.

<p/>`Certainly not!'' said Alice indignantly.

<p/>`Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,'' said the Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the
end of the bill, <div class="bookquote">``French, music, AND WASHING--extra.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`You couldn't have wanted it much,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice; `living at the
bottom of the sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I couldn't afford to learn it.<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock Turtle with a
sigh. `I only took the regular course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`What was that?'' inquired Alice.

<p/>`Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,<div class="bookquote">'' the Mock
Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--
Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I never heard of <div class="bookquote">``Uglification,'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?''

<p/>The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never
heard of uglifying!<div class="bookquote">'' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,
I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Well, then,<div class="bookquote">'' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to
uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about
it, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you
to learn?''

<p/>`Well, there was Mystery,<div class="bookquote">'' the Mock Turtle replied, counting
off the subjects on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,
with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old
conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) taught us
Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`What was THAT like?'' said Alice.

<p/>`Well, I can't show it you myself,<div class="bookquote">'' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm
too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Hadn't time,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics
master, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was an old crab, HE (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I never went to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>)
taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>`So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) did, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) did,'' said the Gryphon, sighing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) turn;
and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.

<p/>`And how many hours a day did you do lessons?'' said Alice, in a
hurry to change the subject.

<p/>`Ten hours the first day,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the
next, and so on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`What a curious plan!'' exclaimed Alice.

<p/>`That's the reason they're called lessons,<div class="bookquote">'' the Gryphon
remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought it over a
little before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) next remark. `Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday?''

<p/>`Of course it was,'' said the Mock Turtle.

<p/>`And how did you manage on the twelfth?'' Alice went on eagerly.

<p/>`That's enough about lessons,<div class="bookquote">'' the Gryphon interrupted in a
very decided tone: `tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) something about the games now.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>The Lobster Quadrille


<p/>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for
a minute or two sobs choked his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) voice. `Same as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) had a bone
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) throat,'' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>)
and punching him (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) voice, and, with tears running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) cheeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) went on
again:--

<p/>`You may not have lived much under the sea--' -LRB-`I haven<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Alice-RRB---
`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
-LRB-Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,
and said `No, never'-RRB- `--so you can have no idea what a delightful
thing a Lobster Quadrille is!''

<p/>`No, indeed,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Why,'' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'

<p/>`Two lines!'' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'

<p/>`THAT generally takes some time,'' interrupted the Gryphon.

<p/>`--you advance twice--'

<p/>`Each with a lobster as a partner!'' cried the Gryphon.

<p/>`Of course,'' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to
partners--'

<p/>`--change lobsters, and retire in same order,'' continued the
Gryphon.

<p/>`Then, you know,'' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'

<p/>`The lobsters!'' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

<p/>`--as far out to sea as you can--'

<p/>`Swim after them!'' screamed the Gryphon.

<p/>`Turn a somersault in the sea!'' cried the Mock Turtle,
capering wildly about.

<p/>`Change lobster's again!'' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

<p/>`Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,'' said the
Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) voice; and the two creatures,
who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat
down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

<p/>`It must be a very pretty dance,'' said Alice timidly.

<p/>`Would you like to see a little of it?'' said the Mock Turtle.

<p/>`Very much indeed,'' said Alice.

<p/>`Come, let's try the first figure!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall
sing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Oh, YOU sing,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now
and then treading on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) toes when they passed too close, and
waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle
sang this, very slowly and sadly:--


<p/>`<div class="bookquote">``Will you walk a little faster?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>said a whiting to a snail.
``There's a porpoise close behind us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s treading on my
tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the
dance?

<p/>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the
dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the
dance?


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to
sea!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But the snail replied <div class="bookquote">``Too far, too far!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and gave a look
askance--
Said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) thanked the whiting kindly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) would not join the
dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join
the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join
the dance.

<p/>`<div class="bookquote">``What matters it how far we go?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) scaly friend replied.
<div class="bookquote">``There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France--
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.

<p/>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the
dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the
dance?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'



<p/>`Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so
like that curious song about the whiting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Oh, as to the whiting,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've
seen them, of course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Yes,'' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
checked herself hastily.

<p/>`I don't know where Dinn may be,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock Turtle, `but
if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I believe so,<div class="bookquote">'' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their
tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`You're wrong about the crumbs,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock Turtle:
`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails
in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle
yawned and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) eyes.--`Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) about the reason and all
that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) said to the Gryphon.

<p/>`The reason is,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with
the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So
they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in
their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew
so much about a whiting before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I can tell you more than that, if you like,<div class="bookquote">'' said the
Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I never thought about it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice. `Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.'' the Gryphon replied very
solemnly.

<p/>Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
repeated in a wondering tone.

<p/>`Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?<div class="bookquote">'' said the Gryphon. `I
mean, what makes them so shiny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.''

<p/>`Boots and shoes under the sea,<div class="bookquote">'' the Gryphon went on in a deep
voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`And what are they made of?'' Alice asked in a tone of great
curiosity.

<p/>`Soles and eels, of course,<div class="bookquote">'' the Gryphon replied rather
impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`If I'd been the whiting,'' said Alice, whose thoughts were
still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, <div class="bookquote">``Keep
back, please: we don't want YOU with us!'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`They were obliged to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with them,<div class="bookquote">'' the Mock Turtle
said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>`Wouldn't it really?'' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

<p/>`Of course not,'' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came
to ME, and told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) was going a journey, I should say <div class="bookquote">``With
what porpoise?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>`Don't you mean <div class="bookquote">``purpose'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?' said Alice.

<p/>`I mean what I say,<div class="bookquote">'' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended
tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR
adventures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,<div class="bookquote">''
said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to
yesterday, because I was a different person then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Explain all that,'' said the Mock Turtle.

<p/>`No, no! The adventures first,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Gryphon in an
impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>So Alice began telling them her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) adventures from the time when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first saw the White Rabbit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a little nervous about
it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), one on
each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
gained courage as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) listeners were perfectly
quiet till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got to the part about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) repeating `YOU ARE OLD,
FATHER WILLIAM,<div class="bookquote">'' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming
different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said
`That's very curious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>FATHER WILLIAM</b></font>)</div><p/>`It's all about as curious as it can be,'' said the Gryphon.

<p/>`It all came different!<div class="bookquote">'' the Mock Turtle repeated
thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) try and repeat
something now. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to begin.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) looked at the Gryphon as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.

<p/>`Stand up and repeat <div class="bookquote">''`TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,'' (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>' said
the Gryphon.

<p/>`How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat
lessons!<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>creatures</b></font>)</div>However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got up, and began to repeat it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head was so
full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hardly knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--

<p/>```Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) declare,
``You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.<div class="bookquote">''
As a duck with its eyelids, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gryphon</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gryphon</b></font>) nose
Trims his (<font color='blue'><b>Gryphon</b></font>) belt and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gryphon</b></font>) buttons, and turns out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gryphon</b></font>) toes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gryphon</b></font>) is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gryphon</b></font>) voice has a timid and tremulous sound.-RSB-

<p/>`That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,''
said the Gryphon.

<p/>`Well, I never heard it before,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Mock Turtle; `but it
sounds uncommon nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Alice said nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had sat down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way
again.

<p/>`I should like to have it explained,'' said the Mock Turtle.

<p/>`She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) can't explain it,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with
the next verse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>`But about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) toes?<div class="bookquote">'' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) turn them out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) nose, you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`It's the first position in dancing.'' Alice said; but was
dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the
subject.

<p/>`Go on with the next verse,'' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:
`it begins <div class="bookquote">``I passed by his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) garden.'' (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Alice did not dare to disobey, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt sure it would
all come wrong, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on in a trembling voice:--

<p/>`I passed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'

<p/>-LSB-later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquet---RSB-

<p/>`What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,<div class="bookquote">'' the Mock Turtle
interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far
the most confusing thing I ever heard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Owl</b></font>)</div><p/>`Yes, I think you'd better leave off,'' said the Gryphon: and
Alice was only too glad to do so.

<p/>`Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?<div class="bookquote">'' the
Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you
a song?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div><p/>`Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,''
Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather
offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
``Turtle Soup,<div class="bookquote">'' will you, old fellow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Turtle</b></font>)</div><p/>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes
choked with sobs, to sing this:--


<p/>`Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

<p/>`Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!''

<p/>`Chorus again!<div class="bookquote">'' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had
just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was heard in the distance.

<p/>`Come on!'' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,
it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.

<p/>`What trial is it?<div class="bookquote">'' Alice panted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran; but the Gryphon
only answered `Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and ran the faster, while more and more
faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the
melancholy words:--

<p/>`Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
Beautiful, beautiful Soup!''



<p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>Who Stole the Tarts?


<p/>The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts
of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:
the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on
each side to guard him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>); and near the King was the White Rabbit,
with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large
dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice
quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,<div class="bookquote">''
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, `and hand round the refreshments!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But there seemed
to be no chance of this, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began looking at everything about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), to pass away the time.

<p/>Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
read about them in books, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite pleased to find that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the
judge,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, `because of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) great wig.''

 (<font color='red'><b>That the judge</b></font>)</div><p/>The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) crown
over the wig, -LRB-look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
did it,-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly
not becoming.

<p/>`And that's the jury-box,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice, `and those twelve
creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was obliged to say `creatures,<div class="bookquote">'' you see, because
some of them were animals, and some were birds,-RRB- `I suppose they
are the jurors.''  (<font color='red'><b>creatures animals</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this last word two or three times over
to herself, being rather proud of it: for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, and
rightly too, that very few little girls of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) age knew the
meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just
as well.

<p/>The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.
`What are they doing?<div class="bookquote">'' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They
can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`They're putting down their names,<div class="bookquote">'' the Gryphon whispered in
reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the
trial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Stupid things!<div class="bookquote">'' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in
the court!''  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>and the King put on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spectacles and looked
anxiously round, to make out who was talking.

<p/>Alice could see, as well as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were looking over their
shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!<div class="bookquote">''
on their slates, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could even make out that one of them
didn't know how to spell `stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>the jurors</b></font>)</div>and that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
neighbour to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). `A nice muddle their slates'll be in
before the trial's over!'' thought Alice.

<p/>One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,
Alice could not stand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went round the court and got
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and very soon found an opportunity of taking it
away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did it so quickly that the poor little juror -LRB-it was
Bill, the Lizard-RRB- could not make out at all what had become of
it; so, after hunting all about for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was obliged to write
with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very
little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

<p/>`Herald, read the accusation!'' said the King.

<p/>On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and
then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

<p/>`The Queen of Hearts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) made some tarts,
All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) stole those tarts,
And took them quite away!''

<p/>`Consider your verdict,'' the King said to the jury.

<p/>`Not yet, not yet!<div class="bookquote">'' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's
a great deal to come before that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the witness</b></font>)</div><p/>`Call the first witness,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King; and the White Rabbit
blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First
witness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the witness</b></font>)</div><p/>The first witness was the Hatter. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) came in with a teacup in
one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg
pardon, your Majesty,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) began, `for bringing these in: but I
hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div><p/>`You ought to have finished,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King. `When did you
begin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Hatter</b></font>)</div><p/>The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) into
the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I
think it was,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) said.

<p/>`Fifteenth,'' said the March Hare.

<p/>`Sixteenth,'' added the Dormouse.

<p/>`Write that down,'' the King said to the jury, and the jury
eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then
added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

<p/>`Take off your hat,'' the King said to the Hatter.

<p/>`It isn't mine,'' said the Hatter.

<p/>`Stolen!'' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who
instantly made a memorandum of the fact.

<p/>`I keep them to sell,<div class="bookquote">'' the Hatter added as an explanation;
`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the Queen put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spectacles, and began staring at the
Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.

<p/>`Give your evidence,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or
I'll have you executed on the spot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the witness</b></font>)</div><p/>This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) kept
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the
Queen, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) confusion he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) bit a large piece out of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.

<p/>Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which
puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a good deal until she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made out what it was: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was
beginning to grow larger again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
decided to remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was as long as there was room for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).

<p/>`I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.<div class="bookquote">'' said the Dormouse, who was
sitting next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). `I can hardly breathe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I can't help it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`You've no right to grow here,'' said the Dormouse.

<p/>`Don't talk nonsense,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice more boldly: `you know
you're growing too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Dormouse:
`not in that ridiculous fashion.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got up very sulkily
and crossed over to the other side of the court.

<p/>All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the
Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hatter</b></font>) said to
one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the
singers in the last concert!'' on which the wretched Hatter
trembled so, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shook both his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shoes off.

<p/>`Give your evidence,<div class="bookquote">'' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have
you executed, whether you're nervous or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I'm a poor man, your Majesty,'' the Hatter began, in a
trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week
or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and
the twinkling of the tea--'

<p/>`The twinkling of the what?'' said the King.

<p/>`It began with the tea,'' the Hatter replied.

<p/>`Of course twinkling begins with a T!<div class="bookquote">'' said the King sharply.
`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I'm a poor man,'' the Hatter went on, `and most things
twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'

<p/>`I didn<div class="bookquote">``t!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

<p/>`You did!'' said the Hatter.

<p/>`I deny it!'' said the March Hare.

<p/>`He (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) denies it,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King: `leave out that part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>`Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,
looking anxiously round to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would deny it too: but the
Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.

<p/>`After that,'' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-
and-butter--'

<p/>`But what did the Dormouse say?'' one of the jury asked.

<p/>`That I can't remember,'' said the Hatter.

<p/>`You MUST remember,<div class="bookquote">'' remarked the King, `or I'll have you
executed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Hatter</b></font>)</div><p/>The miserable Hatter dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) teacup and bread-and-butter,
and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>)
began.

<p/>`You're a very poor speaker,'' said the King.

<p/>Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately
suppressed by the officers of the court. -LRB-As that is rather a
hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had
a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:
into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat
upon it.-RRB-

<p/>`I'm glad I've seen that done,'' thought Alice. `I've so often
read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, ``There was some
attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the
officers of the court,<div class="bookquote">'' and I never understood what it meant
till now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the officers</b></font>)</div><p/>`If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,''
continued the King.

<p/>`I can't go no lower,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as
it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Then you may SIT down,'' the King replied.

<p/>Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

<p/>`Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!<div class="bookquote">'' thought Alice. `Now we
shall get on better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`I'd rather finish my tea,'' said the Hatter, with an anxious
look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

<p/>`You may go,'' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the
court, without even waiting to put his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) shoes on.

<p/>`--and just take his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head off outside,'' the Queen added to one
of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the
officer could get to the door.

<p/>`Call the next witness!'' said the King.

<p/>The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) carried the
pepper-box in her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got into the court, by the way the people near the door began
sneezing all at once.

<p/>`Give your evidence,'' said the King.

<p/>`Shan<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shan</b></font>)</div>said the cook.

<p/>The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a
low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.''

<p/>`Well, if I must, I must,<div class="bookquote">'' the King said, with a melancholy
air, and, after folding his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) arms and frowning at the cook till
his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) eyes were nearly out of sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said in a deep voice, `What
are tarts made of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`Pepper, mostly,'' said the cook.

<p/>`Treacle,'' said a sleepy voice behind her (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>).

<p/>`Collar that Dormouse,<div class="bookquote">'' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that
Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)! Pinch
him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)! Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) whiskers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dormouse</b></font>)</div><p/>For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the
Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down
again, the cook had disappeared.

<p/>`Never mind!<div class="bookquote">'' said the King, with an air of great relief.
`Call the next witness.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) added in an undertone to the
Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
It quite makes my forehead ache!''

<p/>Alice watched the White Rabbit as he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) fumbled over the list,
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,
`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself.
Imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top
of his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) shrill little voice, the name `Alice!''



 (<font color='red'><b>the witness</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>Alice's Evidence


<p/>`Here!'' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had grown in the last few minutes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
jumped up in such a hurry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tipped over the jury-box with
the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) very much of a globe of goldfish she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had accidentally upset
the week before.

<p/>`Oh, I BEG your pardon!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could,
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.

<p/>`The trial cannot proceed,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King in a very grave
voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--
ALL,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as
he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said do.

<p/>Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) haste, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
to move. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that
it signifies much,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself; `I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write
out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,
gazing up into the roof of the court.

<p/>`What do you know about this business?'' the King said to
Alice.

<p/>`Nothing,'' said Alice.

<p/>`Nothing WHATEVER?'' persisted the King.

<p/>`Nothing whatever,'' said Alice.

<p/>`That's very important,<div class="bookquote">'' the King said, turning to the jury.
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when
the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,
of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and
making faces at him (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>`UNimportant, of course, I meant,'' the King hastily said, and
went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--
unimportant--important--' as if he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) were trying which word
sounded best.

<p/>Some of the jury wrote it down `important,<div class="bookquote">'' and some
`unimportant.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice could see this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was near enough to
look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
thought to herself.

<p/>At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily
writing in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) note-book, cackled out `Silence!<div class="bookquote">'' and read out
from his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody looked at Alice.

<p/>`I<div class="bookquote">``M not a mile high,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/>`You are,'' said the King.

<p/>`Nearly two miles high,'' added the Queen.

<p/>`Well, I shan't go, at any rate,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice: `besides,
that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`It's the oldest rule in the book,'' said the King.

<p/>`Then it ought to be Number One,'' said Alice.

<p/>The King turned pale, and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) note-book hastily.
`Consider your verdict,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said to the jury, in a low, trembling
voice.

<p/>`There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,<div class="bookquote">'' said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has
just been picked up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div><p/>`What's in it?'' said the Queen.

<p/>`I haven't opened it yet,<div class="bookquote">'' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems
to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>`It must have been that,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King, `unless it was
written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Who is it directed to?'' said one of the jurymen.

<p/>`It isn't directed at all,<div class="bookquote">'' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,
there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) unfolded the paper
as he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set
of verses.''

<p/>`Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?'' asked another of
they jurymen.

<p/>`No, they're not,<div class="bookquote">'' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the
queerest thing about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-The jury all looked puzzled.-RRB-

<p/>`He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) must have imitated somebody else's hand,'' said the King.
-LRB-The jury all brightened up again.-RRB-

<p/>`Please your Majesty,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and
they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div><p/>`If you didn't sign it,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King, `that only makes the
matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd
have signed your name like an honest man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day.

<p/>`That PROVES his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) guilt,'' said the Queen.

<p/>`It proves nothing of the sort!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice. `Why, you don't
even know what they're about!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Read them,'' said the King.

<p/>The White Rabbit put on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spectacles. `Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) asked.

<p/>`Begin at the beginning,<div class="bookquote">'' the King said gravely, `and go on
till you come to the end: then stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Begin</b></font>)</div><p/>These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--

<p/>`They told me you had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
And mentioned me to him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>):
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave me a good character,
But said I could not swim.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) sent them word I had not gone
-LRB-We know it to be true-RRB-:
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should push the matter on,
What would become of you?

<p/>I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) one, they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) two,
You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) to you,
Though they were mine before.

<p/>If I or she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should chance to be
Involved in this affair,
He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) trusts to you to set them free,
Exactly as we were.

<p/>My notion was that you had been
-LRB-Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had this fit-RRB-
An obstacle that came between
Him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), and ourselves, and it.

<p/>Don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) know she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) liked them best,
For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
Between yourself and me.''

<p/>`That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,''
said the King, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hands; `so now let the jury--'

<p/>`If any one of them can explain it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wasn't a bit
afraid of interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>),-RRB- `I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sixpence. _I_ don't
believe there's an atom of meaning in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe
there's an atom of meaning in it,'' but none of them attempted to
explain the paper.

<p/>`If there's no meaning in it,<div class="bookquote">'' said the King, `that saves a
world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And
yet I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) went on, spreading out the verses on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some
meaning in them, after all. <div class="bookquote">''--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>you
can't swim, can you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) added, turning to the Knave.

<p/>The Knave shook his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head sadly. `Do I look like it?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said.
-LRB-Which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.-RRB-

<p/>`All right, so far,'' said the King, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) went on muttering
over the verses to himself: ```WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--'' that's
the jury, of course-- <div class="bookquote">``I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>why,
that must be what he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) did with the tarts, you know--'

<p/>`But, it goes on <div class="bookquote">``THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,'' (<font color='red'><b>HIM</b></font>)</div>' said
Alice.

<p/>`Why, there they are!'' said the King triumphantly, pointing to
the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again--``BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--<div class="bookquote">'' you never had fits, my
dear, I think?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said to the Queen.

<p/>`Never!'' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spoke. -LRB-The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) slate with one finger, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) found it made no
mark; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
trickling down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) face, as long as it lasted.-RRB-

<p/>`Then the words don't FIT you,'' said the King, looking round
the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

<p/>`It's a pun!<div class="bookquote">'' the King added in an offended tone, and
everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,''  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>the
King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

<p/>`No, no!<div class="bookquote">'' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Stuff and nonsense!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having
the sentence first!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>`Hold your tongue!'' said the Queen, turning purple.

<p/>`I won<div class="bookquote">``t!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Alice.

<p/>`Off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head!'' the Queen shouted at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) voice.
Nobody moved.

<p/>`Who cares for you?<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had grown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) full
size by this time.-RRB- `You're nothing but a pack of cards!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave a little scream, half of fright and half
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
the bank, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head in the lap of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister, who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face.

<p/>`Wake up, Alice dear!<div class="bookquote">'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister; `Why, what a long
sleep you've had!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><p/>`Oh, I've had such a curious dream!<div class="bookquote">'' said Alice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had finished, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and said, `It WAS a
curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's
getting late.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
ran, as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister sat still just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
little Alice and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wonderful Adventures, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) too began
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dream:--

<p/>First, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knee, and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hers--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could hear the very tones of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
voice, and see that queer little toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes--and
still as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) became alive the strange creatures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) little
sister's dream.

<p/>The long grass rustled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet as the White Rabbit hurried
by--the frightened Mouse splashed his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) way through the
neighbouring pool--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) friends shared their never-ending meal,
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) unfortunate
guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's
slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-
bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
all thy other queer noises, would change -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) knew-RRB- to the
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
heavy sobs.

<p/>Lastly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would keep, through all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) riper years, the simple and
loving heart of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) childhood: and how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would gather about
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago: and how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would feel with all their
simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own child-life, and the happy summer days.

<p/>THE END
