<p/>CHAPTER I.

<p/>BRETTON.


<p/>My godmother lived in a handsome house in the clean and ancient town of
Bretton. Her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) husband's family had been residents there for generations,
and bore, indeed, the name of their birthplace--Bretton of Bretton:
whether by coincidence, or because some remote ancestor had been a
personage of sufficient importance to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>) name to his (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>)
neighbourhood, I know not.

<p/>When I was a girl I went to Bretton about twice a year, and well I
liked the visit. The house and its inmates specially suited me. The
large peaceful rooms, the well-arranged furniture, the clear wide
windows, the balcony outside, looking down on a fine antique street,
where Sundays and holidays seemed always to abide--so quiet was its
atmosphere, so clean its pavement--these things pleased me well.

<p/>One child in a household of grown people is usually made very much of,
and in a quiet way I was a good deal taken notice of by Mrs. Bretton,
who had been left a widow, with one son, before I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
husband, a physician, having died while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was yet a young and
handsome woman.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was not young, as I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was still handsome, tall,
well-made, and though dark for an Englishwoman, yet wearing always the
clearness of health in her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) brunette cheek, and its vivacity in a pair
of fine, cheerful black eyes. People esteemed it a grievous pity that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) had not conferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) complexion on her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) son, whose eyes were
blue--though, even in boyhood, very piercing--and the colour of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
long hair such as friends did not venture to specify, except as the sun
shone on it, when they called it golden. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) inherited the lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
mother's features, however; also her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) good teeth, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stature -LRB-or the
promise of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stature, for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was not yet full-grown-RRB-, and, what was
better, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) health without flaw, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spirits of that tone and
equality which are better than a fortune to the possessor.

<p/>In the autumn of the year -- I was staying at Bretton; my godmother
having come in person to claim me of the kinsfolk with whom was at that
time fixed my permanent residence. I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) then plainly saw
events coming, whose very shadow I scarce guessed; yet of which the
faint suspicion sufficed to impart unsettled sadness, and made me glad
to change scene and society.

<p/>Time always flowed smoothly for me at my godmother's side; not with
tumultuous swiftness, but blandly, like the gliding of a full river
through a plain. My visits to her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) resembled the sojourn of Christian
and Hopeful beside a certain pleasant stream, with <div class="bookquote">``green trees on each
bank, and meadows beautified with lilies all the year round.''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian Hopeful</b></font>)</div>The charm
of variety there was not, nor the excitement of incident; but I liked
peace so well, and sought stimulus so little, that when the latter came
I almost felt it a disturbance, and wished rather it had still held
aloof.

<p/>One day a letter was received of which the contents evidently caused
Mrs. Bretton surprise and some concern. I thought at first it was from
home, and trembled, expecting I know not what disastrous communication:
to me, however, no reference was made, and the cloud seemed to pass.

<p/>The next day, on my return from a long walk, I found, as I entered my
bedroom, an unexpected change. In, addition to my own French bed in its
shady recess, appeared in a corner a small crib, draped with white; and
in addition to my mahogany chest of drawers, I saw a tiny rosewood
chest. I stood still, gazed, and considered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what are these things the signs and tokens?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. The answer
was obvious. <div class="bookquote">``A second guest is coming: Mrs. Bretton expects other
visitors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On descending to dinner, explanations ensued. A little girl, I was
told, would shortly be my companion: the daughter of a friend and
distant relation of the late Dr. Bretton's. This little girl, it was
added, had recently lost her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother; though, indeed, Mrs. Bretton ere
long subjoined, the loss was not so great as might at first appear.
Mrs. Home -LRB-Home it seems was the name-RRB- had been a very pretty, but a
giddy, careless woman, who had neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child, and disappointed
and disheartened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband. So far from congenial had the union
proved, that separation at last ensued--separation by mutual consent,
not after any legal process. Soon after this event, the lady having
over-exerted herself at a ball, caught cold, took a fever, and died
after a very brief illness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, naturally a man of very
sensitive feelings, and shocked inexpressibly by too sudden
communication of the news, could hardly, it seems, now be persuaded but
that some over-severity on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part--some deficiency in patience and
indulgence--had contributed to hasten her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) end. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had brooded over this
idea till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spirits were seriously affected; the medical men insisted
on travelling being tried as a remedy, and meanwhile Mrs. Bretton had
offered to take charge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little girl. <div class="bookquote">``And I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>godmother</b></font>)</div>added my
godmother in conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``the child will not be like her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mamma; as
silly and frivolous a little flirt as ever sensible man was weak enough
to marry. For,''  (<font color='red'><b>godmother</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Home _is_ a sensible man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) way,
though not very practical: he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) is fond of science, and lives half his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>)
life in a laboratory trying experiments--a thing his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) butterfly wife
could neither comprehend nor endure; and indeed''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>confessed my
godmother, <div class="bookquote">``I should not have liked it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>godmother</b></font>)</div><p/>In answer to a question of mine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) further informed me that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) late
husband used to say, Mr. Home had derived this scientific turn from a
maternal uncle, a French savant; for he (<font color='blue'><b>savant</b></font>) came, it seems; of mixed French
and Scottish origin, and had connections now living in France, of whom
more than one wrote _de_ before his (<font color='blue'><b>savant</b></font>) name, and called himself noble.

<p/>That same evening at nine o'clock, a servant was despatched to meet the
coach by which our little visitor was expected. Mrs. Bretton and I sat
alone in the drawing-room waiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) coming; John Graham Bretton being
absent on a visit to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) schoolfellows who lived in the country.
My godmother read the evening paper while she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) waited; I sewed. It was a
wet night; the rain lashed the panes, and the wind sounded angry and
restless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bretton from time to time. <div class="bookquote">``What weather for
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) journey! I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were safe here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Warren</b></font>)</div><p/>A little before ten the door-bell announced Warren's return. No sooner
was the door opened than I ran down into the hall; there lay a trunk
and some band-boxes, beside them stood a person like a nurse-girl, and
at the foot of the staircase was Warren with a shawled bundle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warren</b></font>)
arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the child?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I would have opened the shawl, and tried to get a peep at the face, but
it was hastily turned from me to Warren's shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put me down, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Warren</b></font>)</div>said a small voice when Warren opened the
drawing-room door, <div class="bookquote">``and take off this shawl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Warren</b></font>)</div>continued the speaker,
extracting with its minute hand the pin, and with a sort of fastidious
haste doffing the clumsy wrapping. The creature which now appeared made
a deft attempt to fold the shawl; but the drapery was much too heavy
and large to be sustained or wielded by those hands and arms. <div class="bookquote">``Give it
to Harriet, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was then the direction, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can put it away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>This said, it turned and fixed its eyes on Mrs. Bretton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here, little dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said that lady. <div class="bookquote">``Come and let me see if you
are cold and damp: come and let me warm you at the fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child advanced promptly. Relieved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) wrapping, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) appeared
exceedingly tiny; but was a neat, completely-fashioned little figure,
light, slight, and straight. Seated on my godmother's ample lap, she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
looked a mere doll; her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) neck, delicate as wax, her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) head of silky curls,
increased, I thought, the resemblance.

<p/>Mrs. Bretton talked in little fond phrases as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) chafed the child's
hands, arms, and feet; first she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was considered with a wistful gaze,
but soon a smile answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>). Mrs. Bretton was not generally a
caressing woman: even with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) deeply-cherished son, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) manner was
rarely sentimental, often the reverse; but when the small stranger
smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) kissed it, asking, <div class="bookquote">``What is my little one's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Missy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But besides Missy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Polly, papa calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will Polly be content to live with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not _always_; but till papa comes home. Papa is gone away.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) shook
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) head expressively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will return to Polly, or send for her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), ma'am? Do you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Harriet thinks not: at least not for a long while. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) eyes filled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) hand from Mrs. Bretton's and made a
movement to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) lap; it was at first resisted, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
said--<div class="bookquote">``Please, I wish to go: I can sit on a stool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was allowed to slip down from the knee, and taking a footstool, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
carried it to a corner where the shade was deep, and there seated
herself. Mrs. Bretton, though a commanding, and in grave matters even a
peremptory woman, was often passive in trifles: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) allowed the child
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said to me, <div class="bookquote">``Take no notice at present.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But I did take
notice: I watched Polly rest her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) small elbow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) small knee, her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>)
head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) hand; I observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) draw a square inch or two of
pocket-handkerchief from the doll-pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) doll-skirt, and then I
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) weep. Other children in grief or pain cry aloud, without
shame or restraint; but this being wept: the tiniest occasional sniff
testified to her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) emotion. Mrs. Bretton did not hear it: which was quite
as well. Ere long, a voice, issuing from the corner, demanded--<div class="bookquote">``May the
bell be rung for Harriet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I rang; the nurse was summoned and came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet, I must be put to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) little mistress. <div class="bookquote">``You must
ask where my bed is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet signified that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had already made that inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask if you sleep with me, Harriet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Missy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse: <div class="bookquote">``you are to share this young lady's room,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>designating me.

<p/>Missy did not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) seat, but I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) eyes seek me. After some
minutes' silent scrutiny, she (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) emerged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you, ma'am, good night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) to Mrs. Bretton; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
passed me mute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Polly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No need to say good-night, since we sleep in the same chamber,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was
the reply, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) vanished from the drawing-room. We heard
Harriet propose to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) up-stairs. <div class="bookquote">``No need,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was again her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
answer--<div class="bookquote">``no need, no need:''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) small step toiled wearily up the
staircase.

<p/>On going to bed an hour afterwards, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) still wide awake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
had arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) pillows so as to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) little person in a
sitting posture: her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hands, placed one within the other, rested quietly
on the sheet, with an old-fashioned calm most unchildlike. I abstained
from speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) for some time, but just before extinguishing the
light, I recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to lie down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By and by,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will take cold, Missy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) took some tiny article of raiment from the chair at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) crib side,
and with it covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) shoulders. I suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) pleased.
Listening awhile in the darkness, I was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) still
wept,--wept under restraint, quietly and cautiously.

<p/>On awaking with daylight, a trickling of water caught my ear. Behold!
there she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was risen and mounted on a stool near the washstand, with
pains and difficulty inclining the ewer -LRB-which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not lift-RRB- so
as to pour its contents into the basin. It was curious to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) washed and dressed, so small, busy, and noiseless. Evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
was little accustomed to perform her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own toilet; and the buttons,
strings, hooks and eyes, offered difficulties which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) encountered
with a perseverance good to witness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) night-dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
smoothed the drapery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) couch quite neatly; withdrawing into a
corner, where the sweep of the white curtain concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) became
still. I half rose, and advanced my, head to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was occupied.
On her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) knees, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) forehead bent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hands, I perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
was praying.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) nurse tapped at the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) started up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am dressed, Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I have dressed myself, but I do not
feel neat. Make me neat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you dress yourself, Missy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! speak low, Harriet, for fear of waking _the girl_''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>-LRB-meaning me,
who now lay with my eyes shut-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``I dressed myself to learn, against the
time you leave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They proceeded to the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Harriet, I wish this was papa's house! I don't know these people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be a good child, Missy.''

moaning while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reiterated, <div class="bookquote">``Papa! papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I roused myself and started up, to check this scene while it was yet
within bounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say good-morning to the young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>dictated Harriet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Good-morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and then followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) nurse from the room. Harriet
temporarily left that same day, to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own friends, who lived in
the neighbourhood.

<p/>On descending, I found Paulina -LRB-the child called herself Polly, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
full name was Paulina Mary-RRB- seated at the breakfast-table, by Mrs.
Bretton's side; a mug of milk stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), a morsel of bread
filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) hand, which lay passive on the table-cloth: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was not
eating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How we shall conciliate this little creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bretton to
me, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tastes nothing, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looks, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has not
slept.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I expressed my confidence in the effects of time and kindness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were to take a fancy to anybody in the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would soon
settle; but not till then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bretton.




<p/>CHAPTER II.

<p/>PAULINA.


<p/>Some days elapsed, and it appeared she (<font color='blue'><b>PAULINA</b></font>) was not likely to take much of a
fancy to anybody in the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>PAULINA</b></font>) was not exactly naughty or wilful:
she (<font color='blue'><b>PAULINA</b></font>) was far from disobedient; but an object less conducive to
comfort--to tranquillity even--than she (<font color='blue'><b>PAULINA</b></font>) presented, it was scarcely
possible to have before one's eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>PAULINA</b></font>) moped: no grown person could
have performed that uncheering business better; no furrowed face of
adult exile, longing for Europe at Europe's antipodes, ever bore more
legibly the signs of home sickness than did her (<font color='blue'><b>PAULINA</b></font>) infant visage. She (<font color='blue'><b>PAULINA</b></font>)
seemed growing old and unearthly. I, Lucy Snowe, plead guiltless of
that curse, an overheated and discursive imagination; but whenever,
opening a room-door, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) seated in a corner alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) head in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) pigmy hand, that room seemed to me not inhabited, but haunted.

<p/>And again, when of moonlight nights, on waking, I beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) figure,
white and conspicuous in its night-dress, kneeling upright in bed, and
praying like some Catholic or Methodist enthusiast--some precocious
fanatic or untimely saint--I scarcely know what thoughts I had; but
they ran risk of being hardly more rational and healthy than that
child's mind must have been.

<p/>I seldom caught a word of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) prayers, for they were whispered low:
sometimes, indeed, they were not whispered at all, but put up
unuttered; such rare sentences as reached my ear still bore the burden,
<div class="bookquote">``Papa; my dear papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>This, I perceived, was a one-idea'd nature;
betraying that monomaniac tendency I have ever thought the most
unfortunate with which man or woman can be cursed.

<p/>What might have been the end of this fretting, had it continued
unchecked, can only be conjectured: it received, however, a sudden turn.

<p/>One afternoon, Mrs. Bretton, coaxing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) usual station in a
corner, had lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) into the window-seat, and, by way of occupying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) attention, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) to watch the passengers and count how many
ladies should go down the street in a given time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had sat
listlessly, hardly looking, and not counting, when--my eye being fixed
on hers--I witnessed in its iris and pupil a startling transfiguration.
These sudden, dangerous natures--_sensitive_ as they are called--offer
many a curious spectacle to those whom a cooler temperament has secured
from participation in their angular vagaries. The fixed and heavy gaze
swum, trembled, then glittered in fire; the small, overcast brow
cleared; the trivial and dejected features lit up; the sad countenance
vanished, and in its place appeared a sudden eagerness, an intense
expectancy. <div class="bookquote">``It _is_!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) words.

<p/>Like a bird or a shaft, or any other swift thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was gone from the
room. How she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) got the house-door open I cannot tell; probably it might
be ajar; perhaps Warren was in the way and obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) behest, which
would be impetuous enough. I--watching calmly from the window--saw her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>),
in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) black frock and tiny braided apron -LRB-to pinafores she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had an
antipathy-RRB-, dart half the length of the street; and, as I was on the
point of turning, and quietly announcing to Mrs. Bretton that the child
was run out mad, and ought instantly to be pursued, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) caught
up, and rapt at once from my cool observation, and from the wondering
stare of the passengers. A gentleman had done this good turn, and now,
covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cloak, advanced to restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) to the house
whence he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) issue.

<p/>I concluded he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) in a servant's charge and withdraw; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) entered: having tarried a little while below, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came up-stairs.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) reception immediately explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was known to Mrs. Bretton.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was fluttered,
surprised, taken unawares. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) look and manner were even expostulatory;
and in reply to these, rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) words, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``I could not
help it, madam: I found it impossible to leave the country without
seeing with my own eyes how she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will unsettle her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not. And how is papa's little Polly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This question he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) addressed to Paulina, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat down and placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
gently on the ground before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is Polly's papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was the reply, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) leaned on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knee, and
gazed up into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face.

<p/>It was not a noisy, not a wordy scene: for that I was thankful; but it
was a scene of feeling too brimful, and which, because the cup did not
foam up high or furiously overflow, only oppressed one the more. On all
occasions of vehement, unrestrained expansion, a sense of disdain or
ridicule comes to the weary spectator's relief; whereas I have ever
felt most burdensome that sort of sensibility which bends of its own
will, a giant slave under the sway of good sense.

<p/>Mr. Home was a stern-featured--perhaps I should rather say, a
hard-featured man: his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) forehead was knotty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) cheekbones were
marked and prominent. The character of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) face was quite Scotch; but
there was feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eye, and emotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) now agitated
countenance. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) northern accent in speaking harmonised with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
physiognomy. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was at once proud-looking and homely-looking. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) laid
his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hand on the child's uplifted head. She (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``Kiss Polly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). I wished she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would utter some hysterical cry, so that I
might get relief and be at ease. She (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) made wonderfully little noise: she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
seemed to have got what she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wanted--_all_ she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wanted, and to be in a
trance of content. Neither in mien nor in features was this creature
like her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sire, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was of his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) strain: her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind had been filled
from his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>), as the cup from the flagon.

<p/>Indisputably, Mr. Home owned manly self-control, however he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) might
secretly feel on some matters. <div class="bookquote">``Polly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) said, looking down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>)
little girl, <div class="bookquote">``go into the hall; you will see papa's great-coat lying on
a chair; put your hand into the pockets, you will find a
pocket-handkerchief there; bring it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) obeyed; went and returned deftly and nimbly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) was talking to Mrs.
Bretton when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) came back, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) waited with the handkerchief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
hand. It was a picture, in its way, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) tiny stature,
and trim, neat shape, standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) knee. Seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) continued to
talk, apparently unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) hand, opened
the unresisting fingers, insinuated into them the handkerchief, and
closed them upon it one by one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) still seemed not to see or to feel
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); but by-and-by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) knee; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) nestled against him (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>),
and though neither looked at nor spoke to the other for an hour
following, I suppose both were satisfied.

<p/>During tea, the minute thing's movements and behaviour gave, as usual,
full occupation to the eye. First she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) directed Warren, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warren</b></font>) placed the
chairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put papa's chair here, and mine near it, between papa and Mrs.
Bretton: _I_ must hand his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own seat, and beckoned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be near me, as if we were at home, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) intercepted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cup in passing, and would stir the
sugar, and put in the cream herself, <div class="bookquote">``I always did it for you at home;
papa: nobody could do it as well, not even your own self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cream</b></font>)</div><p/>Throughout the meal she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) attentions: rather absurd they
were. The sugar-tongs were too wide for one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had
to use both in wielding them; the weight of the silver cream-ewer, the
bread-and-butter plates, the very cup and saucer, tasked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
insufficient strength and dexterity; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) would lift this, hand
that, and luckily contrived through it all to break nothing. Candidly
speaking, I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) a little busy-body; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) father, blind like
other parents, seemed perfectly content to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and
even wonderfully soothed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) offices.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) is my comfort!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not help saying to Mrs. Bretton. That
lady had her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own <div class="bookquote">``comfort''  (<font color='red'><b>That lady</b></font>)</div>and nonpareil on a much larger scale, and,
for the moment, absent; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) sympathised with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) foible.

<p/>This second <div class="bookquote">``comfort''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>came on the stage in the course of the evening. I
knew this day had been fixed for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) return, and was aware that Mrs.
Bretton had been expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) through all its hours. We were seated
round the fire, after tea, when Graham joined our circle: I should
rather say, broke it up--for, of course, his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) arrival made a bustle; and
then, as Mr. Graham was fasting, there was refreshment to be provided.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) and Mr. Home met as old acquaintance; of the little girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) took no
notice for a time.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) meal over, and numerous questions from his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) mother answered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>)
turned from the table to the hearth. Opposite where he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) had placed
himself was seated Mr. Home, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) elbow, the child. When I say
_child_ I use an inappropriate and undescriptive term--a term
suggesting any picture rather than that of the demure little person in
a mourning frock and white chemisette, that might just have fitted a
good-sized doll--perched now on a high chair beside a stand, whereon
was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) toy work-box of white varnished wood, and holding in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands
a shred of a handkerchief, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was professing to hem, and at
which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bored perseveringly with a needle, that in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fingers seemed
almost a skewer, pricking herself ever and anon, marking the cambric
with a track of minute red dots; occasionally starting when the
perverse weapon--swerving from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) control--inflicted a deeper stab
than usual; but still silent, diligent, absorbed, womanly.

<p/>Graham was at that time a handsome, faithless-looking youth of sixteen.
I say faithless-looking, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was really of a very perfidious
disposition, but because the epithet strikes me as proper to describe
the fair, Celtic -LRB-not Saxon-RRB- character of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) good looks; his (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) waved
light auburn hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) supple symmetry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) smile frequent, and
destitute neither of fascination nor of subtlety -LRB-in no bad sense-RRB-. A
spoiled, whimsical boy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was in those days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, after eyeing the little figure before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in silence
for some time, and when the temporary absence of Mr. Home from the room
relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) from the half-laughing bashfulness, which was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) knew
of timidity--<div class="bookquote">``Mother, I see a young lady in the present society to
whom I have not been introduced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Home's little girl, I suppose you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``I consider your expression of the
least ceremonious: Miss Home _I_ should certainly have said, in
venturing to speak of the gentlewoman to whom I allude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Graham, I will not have that child teased. Don't flatter yourself
that I shall suffer you to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) your butt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>pursued Graham, undeterred by his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother's remonstrance,
<div class="bookquote">``might I have the honour to introduce myself, since no one else seems
willing to render you and me that service? Your slave, John Graham
Bretton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) rose and bowed quite gravely. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deliberately
put down thimble, scissors, work; descended with precaution from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
perch, and curtsying with unspeakable seriousness, said, <div class="bookquote">``How do you
do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have the honour to be in fair health, only in some measure fatigued
with a hurried journey. I hope, ma'am, I see you well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tor-rer-ably well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>was the ambitious reply of the little woman and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now essayed to regain her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) former elevation, but finding this could
not be done without some climbing and straining--a sacrifice of decorum
not to be thought of--and being utterly disdainful of aid in the
presence of a strange young gentleman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) relinquished the high chair
for a low stool: towards that low stool Graham drew in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, ma'am, the present residence, my mother's house, appears to
you a convenient place of abode?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not par-tic-er-er-ly; I want to go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A natural and laudable desire, ma'am; but one which, notwithstanding,
I shall do my best to oppose. I reckon on being able to get out of you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; you will stay with me, I am sure. I have a pony on which you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am. Does that please you? Do you like me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, Miss Home. I am going to be a favourite: preferred before

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished Mrs. Bretton and myself good-night; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed hesitating
whether Graham's deserts entitled him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) to the same attention, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
caught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up with one hand, and with that one hand held her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poised
aloft above his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw herself thus lifted up on high, in the
glass over the fireplace. The suddenness, the freedom, the disrespect
of the action were too much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For shame, Mr. Graham!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) indignant cry, <div class="bookquote">``put me down!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and
when again on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what you would think of me if I were
to treat you in that way, lifting you with my hand''  (<font color='red'><b>member</b></font>)</div>-LRB-raising that
mighty member-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``as Warren lifts the little cat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>member</b></font>)</div><p/>So saying, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) departed.




<p/>CHAPTER III.

<p/>THE PLAYMATES.


<p/>Mr. Home stayed two days. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) visit he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) could not be prevailed on
to go out: he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) sat all day long by the fireside, sometimes silent,
sometimes receiving and answering Mrs. Bretton's chat, which was just
of the proper sort for a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) morbid mood--not over-sympathetic,
yet not too uncongenial, sensible; and even with a touch of the
motherly--she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was sufficiently his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senior to be permitted this touch.

<p/>As to Paulina, the child was at once happy and mute, busy and watchful.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) father frequently lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knee; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) would sit there till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) felt or fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grew restless; then it was--<div class="bookquote">``Papa, put me down;
I shall tire you with my weight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And the mighty burden slid to the rug, and establishing itself on
carpet or stool just at <div class="bookquote">``papa's''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>feet, the white work-box and the
scarlet-speckled handkerchief came into play. This handkerchief, it
seems, was intended as a keepsake for <div class="bookquote">``papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and must be finished
before his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) departure; consequently the demand on the sempstress's
industry -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) accomplished about a score of stitches in half-an-hour-RRB-
was stringent.

<p/>The evening, by restoring Graham to the maternal roof -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) days were
passed at school-RRB-, brought us an accession of animation--a quality not
diminished by the nature of the scenes pretty sure to be enacted
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) and Miss Paulina.

<p/>A distant and haughty demeanour had been the result of the indignity
put upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) the first evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) arrival: her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) usual answer, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), was--<div class="bookquote">``I can't attend to you; I have other things to
think about.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Being implored to state _what_ things:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>Graham would endeavour to seduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) attention by opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) desk and
displaying its multifarious contents: seals, bright sticks of wax,
pen-knives, with a miscellany of engravings--some of them gaily
coloured--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had amassed from time to time. Nor was this powerful
temptation wholly unavailing: her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) eyes, furtively raised from her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) work,
cast many a peep towards the writing-table, rich in scattered pictures.
An etching of a child playing with a Blenheim spaniel happened to
flutter to the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty little dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), delighted.

<p/>Graham prudently took no notice. Ere long, stealing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) corner,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) approached to examine the treasure more closely. The dog's great
eyes and long ears, and the child's hat and feathers, were irresistible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nice picture!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) favourable criticism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--you may have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Graham.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) seemed to hesitate. The wish to possess was strong, but to accept
would be a compromise of dignity. No. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) put it down and turned away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't have it, then, Polly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather not, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you what I will do with the picture if you refuse it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) half turned to listen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cut it into strips for lighting the taper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please--don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>Graham waxed inexorable on hearing the pleading tone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) took the
scissors from his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother's work-basket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here goes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), making a menacing flourish. <div class="bookquote">``Right through Fido's
head, and splitting little Harry's nose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! _No!_ NO!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come to me. Come quickly, or it is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hesitated, lingered, but complied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, will you have it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) asked, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall want payment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A kiss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give the picture first into my hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div><p/>Polly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) said this, looked rather faithless in her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) turn. Graham
gave it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) absconded a debtor, darted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) father, and took refuge
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) knee. Graham rose in mimic wrath and followed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>)
face in Mr. Home's waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa--papa--send him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll not be sent away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Graham.

<p/>With face still averted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) hand to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) off

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, I shall kiss the hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); but that moment it became a
miniature fist, and dealt him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) payment in a small coin that was not
kisses.

<p/>Graham--not failing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) way to be as wily as his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) little
playmate--retreated apparently quite discomfited; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) flung himself on a
sofa, and resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) head against the cushion, lay like one in pain.
Polly, finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) silent, presently peeped at him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eyes and face
were covered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) father's knee, and gazed
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) foe anxiously and long. Graham groaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, what is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), Polly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-groan second.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) makes a noise as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>suggested Graham, feebly, <div class="bookquote">``I think you had better send for
the doctor. Oh my eye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>-LRB-renewed silence, broken only by sighs from
Graham.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were to become blind--?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested this last.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) chastiser could not bear the suggestion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see your eye: I did not mean to touch it, only your mouth; and
I did not think I hit so _very_ hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Silence answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) features worked,--<div class="bookquote">``I am sorry; I am sorry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then succeeded emotion, faltering; weeping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have done trying that child, Graham,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bretton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all nonsense, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Home.

<p/>And Graham once more snatched her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) aloft, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) again punished him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>);
and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) lion's locks, termed him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``The naughtiest,
rudest, worst, untruest person that ever was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>On the morning of Mr. Home's departure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) daughter had some
conversation in a window-recess by themselves; I heard part of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't I pack my box and go with you, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) whispered earnestly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should I be a trouble to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Polly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I am little?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are little and tender. It is only great, strong people
that should travel. But don't look sad, my little girl; it breaks my
heart. Papa, will soon come back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) Polly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, indeed, I am not sad, scarcely at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Polly would be sorry to give papa pain; would she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorrier than sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Polly must be cheerful: not cry at parting; not fret afterwards.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) must look forward to meeting again, and try to be happy meanwhile.
Can she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) do this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) will try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) will. Farewell, then. It is time to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>''_Now_?--just _now_?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) held up quivering lips. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father sobbed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), I remarked, did
not. Having put her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) down, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shook hands with the rest present, and
departed.

<p/>When the street-door closed, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) knees at a chair with a
cry--<div class="bookquote">``Papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was low and long; a sort of <div class="bookquote">``Why hast thou forsaken me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>During an
ensuing space of some minutes, I perceived she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) endured agony. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went
through, in that brief interval of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) infant life, emotions such as
some never feel; it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) constitution: she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would have more of
such instants if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lived. Nobody spoke. Mrs. Bretton, being a mother,
shed a tear or two. Graham, who was writing, lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eyes and
gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I, Lucy Snowe, was calm.

<p/>The little creature, thus left unharassed, did for herself what none
other could do--contended with an intolerable feeling; and, ere long,
in some degree, repressed it. That day she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) would accept solace from
none; nor the next day: she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) grew more passive afterwards.

<p/>On the third evening, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) sat on the floor, worn and quiet, Graham,
coming in, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) up gently, without a word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) did not resist: she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>)
rather nestled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) arms, as if weary. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) sat down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>)
head against him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); in a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) slept; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) upstairs
to bed. I was not surprised that, the next morning, the first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>)
demanded was, <div class="bookquote">``Where is Mr. Graham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It happened that Graham was not coming to the breakfast-table; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had
some exercises to write for that morning's class, and had requested his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
mother to send a cup of tea into the study. Polly volunteered to carry
it: she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) must be busy about something, look after somebody. The cup was
entrusted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>); for, if restless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was also careful. As the study
was opposite the breakfast-room, the doors facing across the passage,
my eye followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) asked, pausing on the threshold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Writing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Graham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you come to take breakfast with your mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too busy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want any breakfast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) deposited the cup on the carpet, like a jailor putting a
prisoner's pitcher of water through his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) cell-door, and retreated.
Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you have besides tea--what to eat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything good. Bring me something particularly nice; that's a kind
little woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) came back to Mrs. Bretton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, ma'am, send your boy something good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall choose for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), Polly; what shall my boy have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) selected a portion of whatever was best on the table; and, ere
long, came back with a whispered request for some marmalade, which was
not there. Having got it, however, -LRB-for Mrs. Bretton refused the pair
nothing-RRB-, Graham was shortly after heard lauding her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) to the skies;
promising that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had a house of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
housekeeper, and perhaps--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) showed any culinary genius--his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) cook;
and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) did not return, and I went to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), I found
Graham and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) breakfasting _tête-à-tête_--she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) elbow,
and sharing his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) fare: excepting the marmalade, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) delicately
refused to touch, lest, I suppose, it should appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had
procured it as much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own account as his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) constantly evinced
these nice perceptions and delicate instincts.

<p/>The league of acquaintanceship thus struck up was not hastily
dissolved; on the contrary, it appeared that time and circumstances
served rather to cement than loosen it. Ill-assimilated as the two were
in age, sex, pursuits, &c., they somehow found a great deal to say to
each other. As to Paulina, I observed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) little character never
properly came out, except with young Bretton. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) got settled, and
accustomed to the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) proved tractable enough with Mrs. Bretton;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) would sit on a stool at that lady's feet all day long, learning
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) task, or sewing, or drawing figures with a pencil on a slate, and
never kindling once to originality, or showing a single gleam of the
peculiarities of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) nature. I ceased to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) under such
circumstances: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was not interesting. But the moment Graham's knock
sounded of an evening, a change occurred; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was instantly at the head
of the staircase. Usually her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) welcome was a reprimand or a threat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not wiped your shoes properly on the mat. I shall tell your
mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Little busybody! Are you there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--and you can't reach me: I am higher up than you''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-peeping between
the rails of the banister; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) could not look over them-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Polly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-such was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) terms for him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), adopted in imitation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am fit to faint with fatigue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>declared Graham, leaning against the
passage-wall in seeming exhaustion. <div class="bookquote">``Dr. Digby''  (<font color='red'><b>the headmaster</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the headmaster-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``has
quite knocked me up with overwork. Just come down and help me to carry
up my books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the headmaster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you're cunning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, Polly--it is positive fact. I'm as weak as a rush. Come
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your eyes are quiet like the cat's, but you'll spring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Spring? Nothing of the kind: it isn't in me. Come down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I may--if you'll promise not to touch--not to snatch me up,
and not to whirl me round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? I couldn't do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-sinking into a chair.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then put the books down on the first step, and go three yards off''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This being done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) descended warily, and not taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) eyes from the
feeble Graham. Of course her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) approach always galvanized him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) to new and
spasmodic life: the game of romps was sure to be exacted. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
would be angry; sometimes the matter was allowed to pass smoothly, and
we could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) say as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) up-stairs: <div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear boy, come
and take your tea--I am sure you must want something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was sufficiently comical to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) sat beside Graham,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) took that meal. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) absence she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was a still personage, but
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) the most officious, fidgety little body possible. I often
wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) would mind herself and be tranquil; but no--herself was
forgotten in him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) could not be sufficiently well waited on, nor
carefully enough looked after; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was more than the Grand Turk in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
estimation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) would gradually assemble the various plates before him (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>),
and, when one would suppose all he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) could possibly desire was within his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>)
reach, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) would find out something else: <div class="bookquote">``Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) would whisper to
Mrs. Bretton,--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps your son would like a little cake--sweet cake,
you know--there is some in there''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to the sideboard cupboard-RRB-.
Mrs. Bretton, as a rule, disapproved of sweet cake at tea, but still
the request was urged,--<div class="bookquote">``One little piece--only for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)--as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) goes to
school: girls--such as me and Miss Snowe--don't need treats, but _he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)_
would like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>Graham did like it very well, and almost always got it. To do him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would have shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) prize with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) owed it;
but that was never allowed: to insist, was to ruffle her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) for the
evening. To stand by his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) knee, and monopolize his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) talk and notice, was
the reward she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) wanted--not a share of the cake.

<p/>With curious readiness did she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) adapt herself to such themes as
interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). One would have thought the child had no mind or life of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own, but must necessarily live, move, and have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) being in
another: now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) father was taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) nestled to Graham,
and seemed to feel by his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) feelings: to exist in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) existence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
learned the names of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) schoolfellows in a trice: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) got by heart
their characters as given from his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) lips: a single description of an
individual seemed to suffice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) never forgot, or confused identities:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) would talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) the whole evening about people she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had never
seen, and appear completely to realise their aspect, manners, and
dispositions. Some she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) learned to mimic: an under-master, who was an
aversion of young Bretton's, had, it seems, some peculiarities, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) caught up in a moment from Graham's representation, and rehearsed
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) amusement; this, however, Mrs. Bretton disapproved and forbade.

<p/>The pair seldom quarrelled; yet once a rupture occurred, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
feelings received a severe shock.

<p/>One day Graham, on the occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) birthday, had some friends--lads
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) own age--to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). Paulina took much interest in the
coming of these friends; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had frequently heard of them; they were
amongst those of whom Graham oftenest spoke. After dinner, the young
gentlemen were left by themselves in the dining-room, where they soon
became very merry and made a good deal of noise. Chancing to pass
through the hall, I found Paulina sitting alone on the lowest step of
the staircase, her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) eyes fixed on the glossy panels of the dining-room
door, where the reflection of the hall-lamp was shining; her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) little
brow knit in anxious, meditation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking about, Polly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing particular; only I wish that door was clear glass--that I
might see through it. The boys seem very cheerful, and I want to go to
them: I want to be with Graham, and watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What hinders you from going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel afraid: but may I try, do you think? May I knock at the door,
and ask to be let in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought perhaps they might not object to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) as a playmate, and
therefore encouraged the attempt.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) knocked--too faintly at first to be heard, but on a second essay
the door unclosed; Graham's head appeared; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) looked in high spirits,
but impatient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want, you little monkey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To come to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you indeed? As if I would be troubled with you! Away to mamma and
Mistress Snowe, and tell them to put you to bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The auburn head and
bright flushed face vanished,--the door shut peremptorily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) was
stunned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) speak so? He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) never spoke so before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) said in
consternation. <div class="bookquote">``What have I done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, Polly; but Graham is busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) school-friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) likes them better than me! He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) turns me away now they are here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had some thoughts of consoling her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), and of improving the occasion by
inculcating some of those maxims of philosophy whereof I had ever a
tolerable stock ready for application. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) stopped me, however, by
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) fingers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) ears at the first words I uttered, and then
lying down on the mat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) face against the flags; nor could either
Warren or the cook root her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) from that position: she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) was allowed to lie,
therefore, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) chose to rise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) own accord.

<p/>Graham forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) impatience the same evening, and would have accosted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) as usual when his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) friends were gone, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) wrenched herself from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) hand; her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) eye quite flashed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) would not bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) good-night; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
would not look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) face. The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) with
indifference, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) grew like a bit of marble. The day after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
teased her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) to know what was the matter; her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lips would not unclose. Of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) could not feel real anger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) side: the match was too
unequal in every way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) tried soothing and coaxing. <div class="bookquote">``Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) so
angry? What had he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) done?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>By-and-by tears answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) petted her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>),
and they were friends. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) was one on whom such incidents were not
lost: I remarked that never after this rebuff did she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), or
follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), or in any way solicit his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) notice. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) once to carry
a book or some other article to Graham when he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was shut up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) study.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) comes out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), proudly; <div class="bookquote">``I don't choose to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) the trouble of rising to open the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Young Bretton had a favourite pony on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) often rode out; from the
window she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) always watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) departure and return. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) ambition
to be permitted to have a ride round the courtyard on this pony; but
far be it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) to ask such a favour. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) descended to the
yard to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) dismount; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) leaned against the gate, the longing
wish for the indulgence of a ride glittered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Polly, will you have a canter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>asked Graham, half carelessly.

<p/>I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was _too_ careless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), turning away with the utmost coolness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>pursued he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You will like it, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think I should care a fig about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the response.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not true. You told Lucy Snowe you longed to have a ride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy Snowe is a _tatter_-box,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) say -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) imperfect
articulation was the least precocious thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had about her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)-RRB-; and
with this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) walked into the house.

<p/>Graham, coming in soon after, observed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother,--<div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I
believe that creature is a changeling: she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is a perfect cabinet of
oddities; but I should be dull without her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) amuses me a great deal
more than you or Lucy Snowe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div>said Paulina to me -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had now got into the habit of
occasionally chatting with me when we were alone in our room at night-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``do you know on what day in the week I like Graham best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I possibly know anything so strange? Is there one day out of
the seven when he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is otherwise than on the other six?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure! Can't you see? Don't you know? I find him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) the most
excellent on a Sunday; then we have him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) the whole day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is quiet,
and, in the evening, _so_ kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This observation was not altogether groundless: going to church, &c.,
kept Graham quiet on the Sunday, and the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) generally dedicated
to a serene, though rather indolent sort of enjoyment by the parlour
fireside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would take possession of the couch, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would call
Polly.

<p/>Graham was a boy not quite as other boys are; all his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) delight did not
lie in action: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was capable of some intervals of contemplation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
could take a pleasure too in reading, nor was his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) selection of books
wholly indiscriminate: there were glimmerings of characteristic
preference, and even of instinctive taste in the choice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) rarely, it
is true, remarked on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) read, but I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) sit and think of
it.

<p/>Polly, being near him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), kneeling on a little cushion or the carpet, a
conversation would begin in murmurs, not inaudible, though subdued. I
caught a snatch of their tenor now and then; and, in truth, some
influence better and finer than that of every day, seemed to soothe
Graham at such times into no ungentle mood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you learned any hymns this week, Polly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have learned a very pretty one, four verses long. Shall I say it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak nicely, then: don't be in a hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>The hymn being rehearsed, or rather half-chanted, in a little singing
voice, Graham would take exceptions at the manner, and proceed to give
a lesson in recitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was quick in learning, apt in imitating;
and, besides, her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) pleasure was to please Graham: she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) proved a ready
scholar. To the hymn would succeed some reading--perhaps a chapter in
the Bible; correction was seldom required here, for the child could
read any simple narrative chapter very well; and, when the subject was
such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) could understand and take an interest in, her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) expression
and emphasis were something remarkable. Joseph cast into the pit; the
calling of Samuel; Daniel in the lions' den;--these were favourite
passages: of the first especially she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) seemed perfectly to feel the
pathos.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Jacob!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) would sometimes say, with quivering lips. <div class="bookquote">``How he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) son Joseph! As much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) once added--<div class="bookquote">``as much, Graham, as I
love you: if you were to die''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) re-opened the book, sought the
verse, and read-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I should refuse to be comforted, and go down into
the grave to you mourning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) gathered Graham in her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) little arms, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
long-tressed head towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>). The action, I remember, struck me as
strangely rash; exciting the feeling one might experience on seeing an
animal dangerous by nature, and but half-tamed by art, too heedlessly
fondled. Not that I feared Graham would hurt, or very roughly check
her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>); but I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) ran risk of incurring such a careless, impatient
repulse, as would be worse almost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) than a blow. On the whole,
however, these demonstrations were borne passively: sometimes even a
sort of complacent wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) earnest partiality would smile not
unkindly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eyes. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said:--<div class="bookquote">``You like me almost as well as if
you were my little sister, Polly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I _do_ like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I _do_ like you very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I was not long allowed the amusement of this study of character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>)
had scarcely been at Bretton two months, when a letter came from Mr.
Home, signifying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) was now settled amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) maternal kinsfolk
on the Continent; that, as England was become wholly distasteful to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) had no thoughts of returning hither, perhaps, for years; and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) little girl to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) will take this news?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bretton, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had
read the letter. _I_ wondered, too, and I took upon myself to
communicate it.

<p/>Repairing to the drawing-room--in which calm and decorated apartment
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was fond of being alone, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) could be implicitly trusted,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) fingered nothing, or rather soiled nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) fingered--I
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) seated, like a little Odalisque, on a couch, half shaded by
the drooping draperies of the window near. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) seemed happy; all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
appliances for occupation were about her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); the white wood workbox, a
shred or two of muslin, an end or two of ribbon collected for
conversion into doll-millinery. The doll, duly night-capped and
night-gowned, lay in its cradle; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was rocking it to sleep, with an
air of the most perfect faith in its possession of sentient and
somnolent faculties; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) eyes, at the same time, being engaged with a
picture-book, which lay open on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``this is a wonderful book.
Candace''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the doll, christened by Graham; for, indeed, its begrimed
complexion gave it much of an Ethiopian aspect-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``Candace is asleep
now, and I may tell you about it; only we must both speak low, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Candace</b></font>)
should waken. This book was given me by Graham; it tells about distant
countries, a long, long way from England, which no traveller can reach
without sailing thousands of miles over the sea. Wild men live in these
countries, Miss Snowe, who wear clothes different from ours: indeed,
some of them wear scarcely any clothes, for the sake of being cool, you
know; for they have very hot weather. Here is a picture of thousands
gathered in a desolate place--a plain, spread with sand--round a man in
black,--a good, _good_ Englishman--a missionary, who is preaching to
them under a palm-tree.''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) showed a little coloured cut to that
effect.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``And here are pictures''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) went on-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``more stranger''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-grammar
was occasionally forgotten-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``than that. There is the wonderful Great
Wall of China; here is a Chinese lady, with a foot littler than mine.
There is a wild horse of Tartary; and here, most strange of all--is a
land of ice and snow, without green fields, woods, or gardens. In this
land, they found some mammoth bones: there are no mammoths now. You
don't know what it was; but I can tell you, because Graham told me. A
mighty, goblin creature, as high as this room, and as long as the hall;
but not a fierce, flesh-eating thing, Graham thinks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) believes, if I
met one in a forest, it would not kill me, unless I came quite in its
way; when it would trample me down amongst the bushes, as I might tread
on a grasshopper in a hayfield without knowing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) rambled on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Polly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``should you like to travel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not just yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the prudent answer; <div class="bookquote">``but perhaps in twenty years,
when I am grown a woman, as tall as Mrs. Bretton, I may travel with
Graham. We intend going to Switzerland, and climbing Mount Blanck; and
some day we shall sail over to South America, and walk to the top of
Kim-kim-borazo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how would you like to travel now, if your papa was with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) reply--not given till after a pause--evinced one of those
unexpected turns of temper peculiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the good of talking in that silly way?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why do you
mention papa? What is papa to you? I was just beginning to be happy,
and not think about him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) so much; and there it will be all to do over
again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) lip trembled. I hastened to disclose the fact of a letter having
been received, and to mention the directions given that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) and Harriet
should immediately rejoin this dear papa. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Polly, are you not
glad?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) made no answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) book and ceased to rock her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) doll;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) gazed at me with gravity and earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall not you like to go to papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) said at last in that trenchant manner she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) usually
employed in speaking to me; and which was quite different from that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
used with Mrs. Bretton, and different again from the one dedicated to
Graham. I wished to ascertain more of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) thought but no: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
would converse no more. Hastening to Mrs. Bretton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>),
and received the confirmation of my news. The weight and importance of
these tidings kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) perfectly serious the whole day. In the evening,
at the moment Graham's entrance was heard below, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) at my
side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) began to arrange a locket-ribbon about my neck, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) displaced
and replaced the comb in my hair; while thus busied, Graham entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) by-and-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) whispered; <div class="bookquote">``tell him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) I am going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In the course of tea-time I made the desired communication. Graham, it
chanced, was at that time greatly preoccupied about some school-prize,
for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was competing. The news had to be told twice before it
took proper hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) attention, and even then he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) dwelt on it but
momently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Polly going? What a pity! Dear little Mousie, I shall be sorry to lose
her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) must come to us again, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And hastily swallowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) took a candle and a small table to
himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) books, and was soon buried in study.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Little Mousie''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>crept to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) side, and lay down on the carpet at his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
feet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) face to the floor; mute and motionless she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) kept that post and
position till bed-time. Once I saw Graham--wholly unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
proximity--push her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) restless foot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) receded an inch or two.
A minute after one little hand stole out from beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) face, to
which it had been pressed, and softly caressed the heedless foot. When
summoned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) nurse she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) rose and departed very obediently, having bid
us all a subdued good-night.

<p/>I will not say that I dreaded going to bed, an hour later; yet I
certainly went with an unquiet anticipation that I should find that
child in no peaceful sleep. The forewarning of my instinct was but
fulfilled, when I discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), all cold and vigilant, perched like a
white bird on the outside of the bed. I scarcely knew how to accost
her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was not to be managed like another child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), however,
accosted me. As I closed the door, and put the light on the
dressing-table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) turned to me with these words:--<div class="bookquote">``I cannot--_cannot_
sleep; and in this way I cannot--_cannot_ live!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I asked what ailed her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dedful miz-er-y!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) piteous lisp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I call Mrs. Bretton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is downright silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) impatient reply; and, indeed, I well
knew that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had heard Mrs. Bretton's foot approach, she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would have
nestled quiet as a mouse under the bedclothes. Whilst lavishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
eccentricities regardlessly before me--for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) professed scarcely
the semblance of affection--she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) never showed my godmother one glimpse
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) inner self: for her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was nothing but a docile, somewhat
quaint little maiden. I examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) cheek was crimson; her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
dilated eye was both troubled and glowing, and painfully restless: in
this state it was obvious she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) must not be left till morning. I guessed
how the case stood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like to bid Graham good-night again?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is not
gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) room yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) at once stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) little arms to be lifted. Folding a shawl
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), I carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) back to the drawing-room. Graham was just
coming out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) cannot sleep without seeing and speaking to you once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) does not like the thought of leaving you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've spoilt her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) from me with good humour, and
kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) little hot face and burning lips. <div class="bookquote">``Polly, you care for me
more than for papa, now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _do_ care for you, but you care nothing for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) whisper.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was assured to the contrary, again kissed, restored to me, and I
carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) away; but, alas! not soothed.

<p/>When I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) could listen to me, I said--<div class="bookquote">``Paulina, you should not
grieve that Graham does not care for you so much as you care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>).
It must be so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) lifted and questioning eyes asked why.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is a boy and you are a girl; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is sixteen and you are only
six; his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) nature is strong and gay, and yours is otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) so much; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) _should_ love me a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) does. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is fond of you. You are his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) favourite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I Graham's favourite?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, more than any little child I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The assurance soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) smiled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) anguish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, <div class="bookquote">``don't fret, and don't expect too much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), or
else he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) will feel you to be troublesome, and then it is all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All over!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) echoed softly; <div class="bookquote">``then I'll be good. I'll try to be good,
Lucy Snowe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I put her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) to bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) forgive me this one time?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) asked, as I undressed myself. I
assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would; that as yet he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was by no means alienated;
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had only to be careful for the future.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no future,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I am going. Shall I ever--ever--see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) again, after I leave England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I returned an encouraging response. The candle being extinguished, a
still half-hour elapsed. I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) asleep, when the little white
shape once more lifted itself in the crib, and the small voice
asked--<div class="bookquote">``Do you like Graham, Miss Snowe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)! Yes, a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a little! Do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) as I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not. No: not as you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) a little. Where is the use of caring for him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) so
very much: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is full of faults.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All boys are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than girls?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely. Wise people say it is folly to think anybody perfect; and
as to likes and dislikes, we should be friendly to all, and worship
none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you a wise person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to try to be so. Go to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _cannot_ go to sleep. Have you no pain just here''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) elfish
hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) elfish breast,-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``when you think _you_ shall have to leave
Graham; for _your_ home is not here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, Polly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you should not feel so much pain when you are
very soon going to rejoin your father. Have you forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? Do you
no longer wish to be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little companion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Dead silence succeeded this question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Child, lie down and sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I urged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My bed is cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I can't warm it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw the little thing shiver. <div class="bookquote">``Come to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, wishing, yet
scarcely hoping, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would comply: for she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was a most strange,
capricious, little creature, and especially whimsical with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
came, however, instantly, like a small ghost gliding over the carpet. I
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was chill: I warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) in my arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) trembled
nervously; I soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). Thus tranquillized and cherished she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) at last
slumbered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very unique child,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I, as I viewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) sleeping countenance
by the fitful moonlight, and cautiously and softly wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) glittering
eyelids and her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) wet cheeks with my handkerchief. <div class="bookquote">``How will she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) get
through this world, or battle with this life? How will she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) bear the
shocks and repulses, the humiliations and desolations, which books, and
my own reason, tell me are prepared for all flesh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) departed the next day; trembling like a leaf when she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) took leave,
but exercising self-command.




<p/>CHAPTER IV.

<p/>MISS MARCHMONT.


<p/>On quitting Bretton, which I did a few weeks after Paulina's
departure--little thinking then I was never again to visit it; never
more to tread its calm old streets--I betook myself home, having been
absent six months. It will be conjectured that I was of course glad to
return to the bosom of my kindred. Well! the amiable conjecture does no
harm, and may therefore be safely left uncontradicted. Far from saying
nay, indeed, I will permit the reader to picture me, for the next eight
years, as a bark slumbering through halcyon weather, in a harbour still
as glass--the steersman stretched on the little deck, his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) face up to
heaven, his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) eyes closed: buried, if you will, in a long prayer. A great
many women and girls are supposed to pass their lives something in that
fashion; why not I with the rest?

<p/>Picture me then idle, basking, plump, and happy, stretched on a
cushioned deck, warmed with constant sunshine, rocked by breezes
indolently soft. However, it cannot be concealed that, in that case, I
must somehow have fallen overboard, or that there must have been wreck
at last. I too well remember a time--a long time--of cold, of danger,
of contention. To this hour, when I have the nightmare, it repeats the
rush and saltness of briny waves in my throat, and their icy pressure
on my lungs. I even know there was a storm, and that not of one hour
nor one day. For many days and nights neither sun nor stars appeared;
we cast with our own hands the tackling out of the ship; a heavy
tempest lay on us; all hope that we should be saved was taken away. In
fine, the ship was lost, the crew perished.

<p/>As far as I recollect, I complained to no one about these troubles.
Indeed, to whom could I complain? Of Mrs. Bretton I had long lost
sight. Impediments, raised by others, had, years ago, come in the way
of our intercourse, and cut it off. Besides, time had brought changes
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), too: the handsome property of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was left guardian for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) son, and which had been chiefly invested in some joint-stock
undertaking, had melted, it was said, to a fraction of its original
amount. Graham, I learned from incidental rumours, had adopted a
profession; both he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother were gone from Bretton, and were
understood to be now in London. Thus, there remained no possibility of
dependence on others; to myself alone could I look. I know not that I
was of a self-reliant or active nature; but self-reliance and exertion
were forced upon me by circumstances, as they are upon thousands
besides; and when Miss Marchmont, a maiden lady of our neighbourhood,
sent for me, I obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) behest, in the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) might assign me
some task I could undertake.

<p/>Miss Marchmont was a woman of fortune, and lived in a handsome
residence; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) was a rheumatic cripple, impotent, foot and hand,
and had been so for twenty years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) always sat upstairs: her (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>)
drawing-room adjoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) bed-room. I had often heard of Miss
Marchmont, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) peculiarities -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) had the character of being
very eccentric-RRB-, but till now had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>). I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) a
furrowed, grey-haired woman, grave with solitude, stern with long
affliction, irritable also, and perhaps exacting. It seemed that a
maid, or rather companion, who had waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) for some years, was
about to be married; and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), hearing of my bereaved lot, had sent for
me, with the idea that I might supply this person's place. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) made the
proposal to me after tea, as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) and I sat alone by her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) fireside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not be an easy life;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) candidly, <div class="bookquote">``for I require a good
deal of attention, and you will be much confined; yet, perhaps,
contrasted with the existence you have lately led, it may appear
tolerable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I reflected. Of course it ought to appear tolerable, I argued inwardly;
but somehow, by some strange fatality, it would not. To live here, in
this close room, the watcher of suffering--sometimes, perhaps, the butt
of temper--through all that was to come of my youth; while all that was
gone had passed, to say the least, not blissfully! My heart sunk one
moment, then it revived; for though I forced myself to _realise_ evils,
I think I was too prosaic to _idealise_, and consequently to exaggerate
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My doubt is whether I should have strength for the undertaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my own scruple,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``for you look a worn-out creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So I did. I saw myself in the glass, in my mourning-dress, a faded,
hollow-eyed vision. Yet I thought little of the wan spectacle. The
blight, I believed, was chiefly external: I still felt life at life's
sources.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else have you in view--anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing clear as yet: but I may find something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you imagine: perhaps you are right. Try your own method, then; and
if it does not succeed, test mine. The chance I have offered shall be
left open to you for three months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was kind. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) so, and expressed my gratitude. While I was
speaking, a paroxysm of pain came on. I ministered to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); made the
necessary applications, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) directions, and, by the time
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was relieved, a sort of intimacy was already formed between us. I,
for my part, had learned from the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bore this attack,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was a firm, patient woman -LRB-patient under physical pain, though
sometimes perhaps excitable under long mental canker-RRB-; and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), from
the good-will with which I succoured her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could
influence my sympathies -LRB-such as they were-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sent for me the next
day; for five or six successive days she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) claimed my company. Closer
acquaintance, while it developed both faults and eccentricities,
opened, at the same time, a view of a character I could respect. Stern
and even morose as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sometimes was, I could wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and sit
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with that calm which always blesses us when we are sensible
that our manners, presence, contact, please and soothe the persons we
serve. Even when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) scolded me--which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did, now and then, very
tartly--it was in such a way as did not humiliate, and left no sting;
it was rather like an irascible mother rating her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter, than a
harsh mistress lecturing a dependant: lecture, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could occasionally storm. Moreover, a vein of reason ever
ran through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passion: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was logical even when fierce. Ere long a
growing sense of attachment began to present the thought of staying
with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as companion in quite a new light; in another week I had
agreed to remain.

<p/>Two hot, close rooms thus became my world; and a crippled old woman, my
mistress, my friend, my all. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) service was my duty--her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) pain, my
suffering--her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) relief, my hope--her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) anger, my punishment--her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) regard,
my reward. I forgot that there were fields, woods, rivers, seas, an
ever-changing sky outside the steam-dimmed lattice of this sick
chamber; I was almost content to forget it. All within me became
narrowed to my lot. Tame and still by habit, disciplined by destiny, I
demanded no walks in the fresh air; my appetite needed no more than the
tiny messes served for the invalid. In addition, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) gave me the
originality of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) character to study: the steadiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) virtues, I
will add, the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) passions, to admire; the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
feelings to trust. All these things she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had, and for these things I
clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).

<p/>For these things I would have crawled on with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) for twenty years, if
for twenty years longer her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) life of endurance had been protracted. But
another decree was written. It seemed I must be stimulated into action.
I must be goaded, driven, stung, forced to energy. My little morsel of
human affection, which I prized as if it were a solid pearl, must melt
in my fingers and slip thence like a dissolving hailstone. My small
adopted duty must be snatched from my easily contented conscience. I
had wanted to compromise with Fate: to escape occasional great agonies
by submitting to a whole life of privation and small pains. Fate would
not so be pacified; nor would Providence sanction this shrinking sloth
and cowardly indolence.

<p/>One February night--I remember it well--there came a voice near Miss
Marchmont's house, heard by every inmate, but translated, perhaps, only
by one. After a calm winter, storms were ushering in the spring. I had
put Miss Marchmont to bed; I sat at the fireside sewing. The wind was
wailing at the windows; it had wailed all day; but, as night deepened,
it took a new tone--an accent keen, piercing, almost articulate to the
ear; a plaint, piteous and disconsolate to the nerves, trilled in every
gust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, hush! hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said in my disturbed mind, dropping my work, and
making a vain effort to stop my ears against that subtle, searching
cry. I had heard that very voice ere this, and compulsory observation
had forced on me a theory as to what it boded. Three times in the
course of my life, events had taught me that these strange accents in
the storm--this restless, hopeless cry--denote a coming state of the
atmosphere unpropitious to life. Epidemic diseases, I believed, were
often heralded by a gasping, sobbing, tormented, long-lamenting east
wind. Hence, I inferred, arose the legend of the Banshee. I fancied,
too, I had noticed--but was not philosopher enough to know whether
there was any connection between the circumstances--that we often at
the same time hear of disturbed volcanic action in distant parts of the
world; of rivers suddenly rushing above their banks; and of strange
high tides flowing furiously in on low sea-coasts. <div class="bookquote">``Our globe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had
said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``seems at such periods torn and disordered; the feeble
amongst us wither in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) distempered breath, rushing hot from steaming
volcanoes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I listened and trembled; Miss Marchmont slept.

<p/>About midnight, the storm in one half-hour fell to a dead calm. The
fire, which had been burning dead, glowed up vividly. I felt the air
change, and become keen. Raising blind and curtain, I looked out, and
saw in the stars the keen sparkle of a sharp frost.

<p/>Turning away, the object that met my eyes was Miss Marchmont awake,
lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) head from the pillow, and regarding me with unusual
earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a fine night?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) asked.

<p/>I replied in the affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``for I feel so strong, so well. Raise me. I
feel young to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``young, light-hearted, and happy.
What if my complaint be about to take a turn, and I am yet destined to
enjoy health? It would be a miracle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And these are not the days of miracles,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought to myself, and
wondered to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) talk so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) went on directing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) conversation to
the past, and seeming to recall its incidents, scenes, and personages,
with singular vividness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love Memory to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) said: ``I prize her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as my best friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
is just now giving me a deep delight: she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is bringing back to my heart,
in warm and beautiful life, realities--not mere empty ideas, but what
were once realities, and that I long have thought decayed, dissolved,
mixed in with grave-mould. I possess just now the hours, the thoughts,
the hopes of my youth. I renew the love of my life--its only
love--almost its only affection; for I am not a particularly good
woman: I am not amiable. Yet I have had my feelings, strong and
concentrated; and these feelings had their object; which, in its single
self, was dear to me, as to the majority of men and women, are all the
unnumbered points on which they dissipate their regard. While I loved,
and while I was loved, what an existence I enjoyed! What a glorious
year I can recall--how bright it comes back to me! What a living
spring--what a warm, glad summer--what soft moonlight, silvering the
autumn evenings--what strength of hope under the ice-bound waters and
frost-hoar fields of that year's winter! Through that year my heart
lived with Frank's heart. O my noble Frank--my faithful Frank--my
_good_ Frank! so much better than myself--his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) standard in all things so
much higher! This I can now see and say: if few women have suffered as
I did in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) loss, few have enjoyed what I did in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) love. It was a
far better kind of love than common; I had no doubts about it or him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>):
it was such a love as honoured, protected, and elevated, no less than
it gladdened her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to whom it was given. Let me now ask, just at this
moment, when my mind is so strangely clear,--let me reflect why it was
taken from me? For what crime was I condemned, after twelve months of
bliss, to undergo thirty years of sorrow?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) continued after a pause: <div class="bookquote">``I cannot--_cannot_ see
the reason; yet at this hour I can say with sincerity, what I never
tried to say before, Inscrutable God, Thy will be done! And at this
moment I can believe that death will restore me to Frank. I never
believed it till now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is dead, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) said, ``one happy Christmas Eve I dressed and
decorated myself, expecting my lover, very soon to be my husband, would
come that night to visit me. I sat down to wait. Once more I see that
moment--I see the snow twilight stealing through the window over which
the curtain was not dropped, for I designed to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ride up the
white walk; I see and feel the soft firelight warming me, playing on my
silk dress, and fitfully showing me my own young figure in a glass. I
see the moon of a calm winter night, float full, clear, and cold, over
the inky mass of shrubbery, and the silvered turf of my grounds. I
wait, with some impatience in my pulse, but no doubt in my breast. The
flames had died in the fire, but it was a bright mass yet; the moon was
mounting high, but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was still visible from the lattice; the clock
neared ten; he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) rarely tarried later than this, but once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had
been delayed so long.

<p/>``Would he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) for once fail me? No--not even for once; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was
coming--and coming fast--to atone for lost time. ``Frank! you furious
rider,<div class="bookquote">'' I said inwardly, listening gladly, yet anxiously, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>)
approaching gallop, `you shall be rebuked for this: I will tell you it
is _my_ neck you are putting in peril; for whatever is yours is, in a
dearer and tenderer sense, mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>rider</b></font>)</div>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) was: I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>); but I think
tears were in my eyes, my sight was so confused. I saw the horse; I
heard it stamp--I saw at least a mass; I heard a clamour. _Was_ it a
horse? or what heavy, dragging thing was it, crossing, strangely dark,
the lawn. How could I name that thing in the moonlight before me? or
how could I utter the feeling which rose in my soul?

<p/>``I could only run out. A great animal--truly, Frank's black
horse--stood trembling, panting, snorting before the door; a man held
it, Frank, as I thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded. Thomas, my own servant, answered by
saying sharply, <div class="bookquote">``Go into the house, madam.''  (<font color='red'><b>servant</b></font>)</div>And then calling to another
servant, who came hurrying from the kitchen as if summoned by some
instinct, <div class="bookquote">``Ruth, take missis into the house directly.''  (<font color='red'><b>another servant</b></font>)</div>But I was
kneeling down in the snow, beside something that lay there--something
that I had seen dragged along the ground--something that sighed, that
groaned on my breast, as I lifted and drew it to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was not dead;
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was not quite unconscious. I had him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) carried in; I refused to be
ordered about and thrust from him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). I was quite collected enough, not
only to be my own mistress but the mistress of others. They had begun
by trying to treat me like a child, as they always do with people
struck by God's hand; but I gave place to none except the surgeon; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had done what he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) could, I took my dying Frank to myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had
strength to fold me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arms; he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had power to speak my name; he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)
heard me as I prayed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) very softly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) felt me as I tenderly and
fondly comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>).

<p/>''`Maria,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am dying in Paradise.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) last breath
in faithful words for me. When the dawn of Christmas morning broke, my
Frank was with God.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``happened thirty years ago. I have suffered
since. I doubt if I have made the best use of all my calamities. Soft,
amiable natures they would have refined to saintliness; of strong, evil
spirits they would have made demons; as for me, I have only been a
woe-struck and selfish woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have done much good,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was noted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) liberal
almsgiving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not withheld money, you mean, where it could assuage
affliction. What of that? It cost me no effort or pang to give. But I
think from this day I am about to enter a better frame of mind, to
prepare myself for reunion with Frank. You see I still think of Frank
more than of God; and unless it be counted that in thus loving the
creature so much, so long, and so exclusively, I have not at least
blasphemed the Creator, small is my chance of salvation. What do you
think, Lucy, of these things? Be my chaplain, and tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This question I could not answer: I had no words. It seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
thought I _had_ answered it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very right, my child. We should acknowledge God merciful, but not
always for us comprehensible. We should accept our own lot, whatever it
be, and try to render happy that of others. Should we not? Well,
to-morrow I will begin by trying to make you happy. I will endeavour to
do something for you, Lucy: something that will benefit you when I am
dead. My head aches now with talking too much; still I am happy. Go to
bed. The clock strikes two. How late you sit up; or rather how late I,
in my selfishness, keep you up. But go now; have no more anxiety for
me; I feel I shall rest well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) composed herself as if to slumber. I, too, retired to my crib in a
closet within her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) room. The night passed in quietness; quietly her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) doom
must at last have come: peacefully and painlessly: in the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
was found without life, nearly cold, but all calm and undisturbed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
previous excitement of spirits and change of mood had been the prelude
of a fit; one stroke sufficed to sever the thread of an existence so
long fretted by affliction.




<p/>CHAPTER V.

<p/>TURNING A NEW LEAF.


<p/>My mistress being dead, and I once more alone, I had to look out for a
new place. About this time I might be a little--a very little--shaken
in nerves. I grant I was not looking well, but, on the contrary, thin,
haggard, and hollow-eyed; like a sitter-up at night, like an
overwrought servant, or a placeless person in debt. In debt, however, I
was not; nor quite poor; for though Miss Marchmont had not had time to
benefit me, as, on that last night, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) intended, yet, after
the funeral, my wages were duly paid by her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) second cousin, the heir, an
avaricious-looking man, with pinched nose and narrow temples, who,
indeed, I heard long afterwards, turned out a thorough miser: a direct
contrast to his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) generous kinswoman, and a foil to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) memory, blessed
to this day by the poor and needy. The possessor, then, of fifteen
pounds; of health, though worn, not broken, and of a spirit in similar
condition; I might still; in comparison with many people, be regarded
as occupying an enviable position. An embarrassing one it was, however,
at the same time; as I felt with some acuteness on a certain day, of
which the corresponding one in the next week was to see my departure
from my present abode, while with another I was not provided.

<p/>In this dilemma I went, as a last and sole resource, to see and consult
an old servant of our family; once my nurse, now housekeeper at a grand
mansion not far from Miss Marchmont's. I spent some hours with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
comforted, but knew not how to advise me. Still all inward darkness, I
left her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) about twilight; a walk of two miles lay before me; it was a
clear, frosty night. In spite of my solitude, my poverty, and my
perplexity, my heart, nourished and nerved with the vigour of a youth
that had not yet counted twenty-three summers, beat light and not
feebly. Not feebly, I am sure, or I should have trembled in that lonely
walk, which lay through still fields, and passed neither village nor
farmhouse, nor cottage: I should have quailed in the absence of
moonlight, for it was by the leading of stars only I traced the dim
path; I should have quailed still more in the unwonted presence of that
which to-night shone in the north, a moving mystery--the Aurora
Borealis. But this solemn stranger influenced me otherwise than through
my fears. Some new power it seemed to bring. I drew in energy with the
keen, low breeze that blew on its path. A bold thought was sent to my
mind; my mind was made strong to receive it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave this wilderness,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>it was said to me, <div class="bookquote">``and go out hence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the query.

<p/>I had not very far to look; gazing from this country parish in that
flat, rich middle of England--I mentally saw within reach what I had
never yet beheld with my bodily eyes: I saw London.

<p/>The next day I returned to the hall, and asking once more to see the
housekeeper, I communicated to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) my plan.

<p/>Mrs. Barrett was a grave, judicious woman, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) knew little more
of the world than myself; but grave and judicious as she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) did
not charge me with being out of my senses; and, indeed, I had a staid
manner of my own which ere now had been as good to me as cloak and hood
of hodden grey, since under its favour I had been enabled to achieve
with impunity, and even approbation, deeds that, if attempted with an
excited and unsettled air, would in some minds have stamped me as a
dreamer and zealot.

<p/>The housekeeper was slowly propounding some difficulties, while she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
prepared orange-rind for marmalade, when a child ran past the window
and came bounding into the room. It was a pretty child, and as it
danced, laughing, up to me--for we were not strangers -LRB-nor, indeed, was
its mother--a young married daughter of the house--a stranger-RRB---I took
it on my knee.

<p/>Different as were our social positions now, this child's mother and I
had been schoolfellows, when I was a girl of ten and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a young lady
of sixteen; and I remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), good-looking, but dull, in a lower
class than mine.

<p/>I was admiring the boy's handsome dark eyes, when the mother, young
Mrs. Leigh, entered. What a beautiful and kind-looking woman was the
good-natured and comely, but unintellectual, girl become! Wifehood and
maternity had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thus, as I have since seen them change others
even less promising than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Me she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had forgotten. I was changed too,
though not, I fear, for the better. I made no attempt to recall myself
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) memory; why should I? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in a
walk, and behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) followed a nurse, carrying an infant. I only
mention the incident because, in addressing the nurse, Mrs. Leigh spoke
French -LRB-very bad French, by the way, and with an incorrigibly bad
accent, again forcibly reminding me of our school-days-RRB-: and I found
the woman was a foreigner. The little boy chattered volubly in French
too. When the whole party were withdrawn, Mrs. Barrett remarked that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) young lady had brought that foreign nurse home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) two years
ago, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) return from a Continental excursion; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) was treated
almost as well as a governess, and had nothing to do but walk out with
the baby and chatter French with Master Charles; <div class="bookquote">``and,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>added Mrs.
Barrett, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) says there are many Englishwomen in foreign families as
well placed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barrett</b></font>)</div><p/>I stored up this piece of casual information, as careful housewives
store seemingly worthless shreds and fragments for which their
prescient minds anticipate a possible use some day. Before I left my
old friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) gave me the address of a respectable old-fashioned inn
in the City, which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrett</b></font>) said, my uncles used to frequent in former days.

<p/>In going to London, I ran less risk and evinced less enterprise than
the reader may think. In fact, the distance was only fifty miles. My
means would suffice both to take me there, to keep me a few days, and
also to bring me back if I found no inducement to stay. I regarded it
as a brief holiday, permitted for once to work-weary faculties, rather
than as an adventure of life and death. There is nothing like taking
all you do at a moderate estimate: it keeps mind and body tranquil;
whereas grandiloquent notions are apt to hurry both into fever.

<p/>Fifty miles were then a day's journey -LRB-for I speak of a time gone by:
my hair, which, till a late period, withstood the frosts of time, lies
now, at last white, under a white cap, like snow beneath snow-RRB-. About
nine o'clock of a wet February night I reached London.

<p/>My reader, I know, is one who would not thank me for an elaborate
reproduction of poetic first impressions; and it is well, inasmuch as I
had neither time nor mood to cherish such; arriving as I did late, on a
dark, raw, and rainy evening, in a Babylon and a wilderness, of which
the vastness and the strangeness tried to the utmost any powers of
clear thought and steady self-possession with which, in the absence of
more brilliant faculties, Nature might have gifted me.

<p/>When I left the coach, the strange speech of the cabmen and others
waiting round, seemed to me odd as a foreign tongue. I had never before
heard the English language chopped up in that way. However, I managed
to understand and to be understood, so far as to get myself and trunk
safely conveyed to the old inn whereof I had the address. How
difficult, how oppressive, how puzzling seemed my flight! In London for
the first time; at an inn for the first time; tired with travelling;
confused with darkness; palsied with cold; unfurnished with either
experience or advice to tell me how to act, and yet--to act obliged.

<p/>Into the hands of common sense I confided the matter. Common sense,
however, was as chilled and bewildered as all my other faculties, and
it was only under the spur of an inexorable necessity that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
spasmodically executed her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) trust. Thus urged, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) paid the porter:
considering the crisis, I did not blame her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) too much that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was
hugely cheated; she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) asked the waiter for a room; she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) timorously called
for the chambermaid; what is far more, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) bore, without being wholly
overcome, a highly supercilious style of demeanour from that young
lady, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared.

<p/>I recollect this same chambermaid was a pattern of town prettiness and
smartness. So trim her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) waist, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cap, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress--I wondered how they
had all been manufactured. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) speech had an accent which in its
mincing glibness seemed to rebuke mine as by authority; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spruce
attire flaunted an easy scorn to my plain country garb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it can't be helped,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought, <div class="bookquote">``and then the scene is new, and
the circumstances; I shall gain good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Maintaining a very quiet manner towards this arrogant little maid, and
subsequently observing the same towards the parsonic-looking,
black-coated, white-neckclothed waiter, I got civility from them ere
long. I believe at first they thought I was a servant; but in a little
while they changed their minds, and hovered in a doubtful state between
patronage and politeness.

<p/>I kept up well till I had partaken of some refreshment, warmed myself
by a fire, and was fairly shut into my own room; but, as I sat down by
the bed and rested my head and arms on the pillow, a terrible
oppression overcame me. All at once my position rose on me like a
ghost. Anomalous, desolate, almost blank of hope it stood. What was I
doing here alone in great London? What should I do on the morrow? What
prospects had I in life? What friends had I on, earth? Whence did I
come? Whither should I go? What should I do?

<p/>I wet the pillow, my arms, and my hair, with rushing tears. A dark
interval of most bitter thought followed this burst; but I did not
regret the step taken, nor wish to retract it. A strong, vague
persuasion that it was better to go forward than backward, and that I
_could_ go forward--that a way, however narrow and difficult, would in
time open--predominated over other feelings: its influence hushed them
so far, that at last I became sufficiently tranquil to be able to say
my prayers and seek my couch. I had just extinguished my candle and
lain down, when a deep, low, mighty tone swung through the night. At
first I knew it not; but it was uttered twelve times, and at the
twelfth colossal hum and trembling knell, I said: <div class="bookquote">``I lie in the shadow
of St. Paul's.''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VI.

<p/>LONDON.


<p/>The next day was the first of March, and when I awoke, rose, and opened
my curtain, I saw the risen sun struggling through fog. Above my head,
above the house-tops, co-elevate almost with the clouds, I saw a
solemn, orbed mass, dark blue and dim--THE DOME. While I looked, my
inner self moved; my spirit shook its always-fettered wings half loose;
I had a sudden feeling as if I, who never yet truly lived, were at last
about to taste life. In that morning my soul grew as fast as Jonah's
gourd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did well to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, proceeding to dress with speed and care.
<div class="bookquote">``I like the spirit of this great London which I feel around me. Who but
a coward would pass his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) whole life in hamlets; and for ever abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)
faculties to the eating rust of obscurity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Being dressed, I went down; not travel-worn and exhausted, but tidy and
refreshed. When the waiter came in with my breakfast, I managed to
accost him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) sedately, yet cheerfully; we had ten minutes' discourse, in
the course of which we became usefully known to each other.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) was a grey-haired, elderly man; and, it seemed, had lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)
present place twenty years. Having ascertained this, I was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) must
remember my two uncles, Charles and Wilmot, who, fifteen, years ago,
were frequent visitors here. I mentioned their names; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) recalled them
perfectly, and with respect. Having intimated my connection, my
position in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes was henceforth clear, and on a right footing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
said I was like my uncle Charles: I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spoke truth, because
Mrs. Barrett was accustomed to say the same thing. A ready and obliging
courtesy now replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) former uncomfortably doubtful manner;
henceforth I need no longer be at a loss for a civil answer to a
sensible question.

<p/>The street on which my little sitting-room window looked was narrow,
perfectly quiet, and not dirty: the few passengers were just such as
one sees in provincial towns: here was nothing formidable; I felt sure
I might venture out alone.

<p/>Having breakfasted, out I went. Elation and pleasure were in my heart:
to walk alone in London seemed of itself an adventure. Presently I
found myself in Paternoster Row--classic ground this. I entered a
bookseller's shop, kept by one Jones: I bought a little book--a piece
of extravagance I could ill afford; but I thought I would one day give
or send it to Mrs. Barrett. Mr. Jones, a dried-in man of business,
stood behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) desk: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) seemed one of the greatest, and I one of the
happiest of beings.

<p/>Prodigious was the amount of life I lived that morning. Finding myself
before St. Paul's, I went in; I mounted to the dome: I saw thence
London, with its river, and its bridges, and its churches; I saw
antique Westminster, and the green Temple Gardens, with sun upon them,
and a glad, blue sky, of early spring above; and between them and it,
not too dense, a cloud of haze.

<p/>Descending, I went wandering whither chance might lead, in a still
ecstasy of freedom and enjoyment; and I got--I know not how--I got into
the heart of city life. I saw and felt London at last: I got into the
Strand; I went up Cornhill; I mixed with the life passing along; I
dared the perils of crossings. To do this, and to do it utterly alone,
gave me, perhaps an irrational, but a real pleasure. Since those days,
I have seen the West End, the parks, the fine squares; but I love the
city far better. The city seems so much more in earnest: its business,
its rush, its roar, are such serious things, sights, and sounds. The
city is getting its living--the West End but enjoying its pleasure. At
the West End you may be amused, but in the city you are deeply excited.

<p/>Faint, at last, and hungry -LRB-it was years since I had felt such healthy
hunger-RRB-, I returned, about two o'clock, to my dark, old, and quiet inn.
I dined on two dishes--a plain joint and vegetables; both seemed
excellent: how much better than the small, dainty messes Miss
Marchmont's cook used to send up to my kind, dead mistress and me, and
to the discussion of which we could not bring half an appetite between
us! Delightfully tired, I lay down, on three chairs for an hour -LRB-the
room did not boast a sofa-RRB-. I slept, then I woke and thought for two
hours.

<p/>My state of mind, and all accompanying circumstances, were just now
such as most to favour the adoption of a new, resolute, and
daring--perhaps desperate--line of action. I had nothing to lose.
Unutterable loathing of a desolate existence past, forbade return. If I
failed in what I now designed to undertake, who, save myself, would
suffer? If I died far away from--home, I was going to say, but I had no
home--from England, then, who would weep?

<p/>I might suffer; I was inured to suffering: death itself had not, I
thought, those terrors for me which it has for the softly reared. I
had, ere this, looked on the thought of death with a quiet eye.
Prepared, then, for any consequences, I formed a project.

<p/>That same evening I obtained from my friend, the waiter, information
respecting, the sailing of vessels for a certain continental port,
Boue-Marine. No time, I found, was to be lost: that very night I must
take my berth. I might, indeed, have waited till the morning before
going on board, but would not run the risk of being too late.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better take your berth at once, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>counselled the waiter. I
agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>), and having discharged my bill, and acknowledged my
friend's services at a rate which I now know was princely, and which in
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes must have seemed absurd--and indeed, while pocketing the cash,
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) smiled a faint smile which intimated his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) opinion of the donor's
_savoir-faire_--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) proceeded to call a coach. To the driver he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) also
recommended me, giving at the same time an injunction about taking me,
I think, to the wharf, and not leaving me to the watermen; which that
functionary promised to observe, but failed in keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) promise: on
the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) offered me up as an oblation, served me as a dripping
roast, making me alight in the midst of a throng of watermen.

<p/>This was an uncomfortable crisis. It was a dark night. The coachman
instantly drove off as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fare: the watermen
commenced a struggle for me and my trunk. Their oaths I hear at this
moment: they shook my philosophy more than did the night, or the
isolation, or the strangeness of the scene. One laid hands on my trunk.
I looked on and waited quietly; but when another laid hands on me, I
spoke up, shook off his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) touch, stepped at once into a boat, desired
austerely that the trunk should be placed beside me--<div class="bookquote">``Just
there,'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>--which was instantly done; for the owner of the boat I had
chosen became now an ally: I was rowed off.

<p/>Black was the river as a torrent of ink; lights glanced on it from the
piles of building round, ships rocked on its bosom. They rowed me up to
several vessels; I read by lantern-light their names painted in great
white letters on a dark ground. <div class="bookquote">``The Ocean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Phoenix,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The
Consort,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Dolphin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were passed in turns; but <div class="bookquote">``The Vivid''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was my
ship, and it seemed she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lay further down.

<p/>Down the sable flood we glided, I thought of the Styx, and of Charon
rowing some solitary soul to the Land of Shades. Amidst the strange
scene, with a chilly wind blowing in my face and midnight clouds
dropping rain above my head; with two rude rowers for companions, whose
insane oaths still tortured my ear, I asked myself if I was wretched or
terrified. I was neither. Often in my life have I been far more so
under comparatively safe circumstances. <div class="bookquote">``How is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<div class="bookquote">``Methinks I am animated and alert, instead of being depressed and
apprehensive?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>I could not tell how it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THE VIVID''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>started out, white and glaring, from the black night at
last.--<div class="bookquote">``Here you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>the waterman</b></font>)</div>said the waterman, and instantly demanded six
shillings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ask too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. He (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) drew off from the vessel and swore he (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>)
would not embark me till I paid it. A young man, the steward as I found
afterwards, was looking over the ship's side; he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) grinned a smile in
anticipation of the coming contest; to disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>), I paid the
money. Three times that afternoon I had given crowns where I should
have given shillings; but I consoled myself with the reflection, <div class="bookquote">``It is
the price of experience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've cheated you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the steward</b></font>)</div>said the steward exultingly when I got on board.
I answered phlegmatically that <div class="bookquote">``I knew it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and went below.

<p/>A stout, handsome, and showy woman was in the ladies' cabin. I asked to
be shown my berth; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked hard at me, muttered something about its
being unusual for passengers to come on board at that hour, and seemed
disposed to be less than civil. What a face she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had--so comely--so
insolent and so selfish!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that I am on board, I shall certainly stay here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my answer.
<div class="bookquote">``I will trouble you to show me my berth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) complied, but sullenly. I took off my bonnet, arranged my things,
and lay down. Some difficulties had been passed through; a sort of
victory was won: my homeless, anchorless, unsupported mind had again
leisure for a brief repose. Till the <div class="bookquote">``Vivid''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>arrived in harbour, no
further action would be required of me; but then... Oh! I could not
look forward. Harassed, exhausted, I lay in a half-trance.

<p/>The stewardess talked all night; not to me but to the young steward,
her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) son and her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) very picture. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) passed in and out of the cabin
continually: they disputed, they quarrelled, they made it up again
twenty times in the course of the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) professed to be writing a
letter home--she (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) father; she (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) read passages of it aloud,
heeding me no more than a stock--perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) believed me asleep.
Several of these passages appeared to comprise family secrets, and bore
special reference to one <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>a younger sister who, from the
bearing of the epistle, seemed to be on the brink of perpetrating a
romantic and imprudent match; loud was the protest of this elder lady
against the distasteful union. The dutiful son laughed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother's
correspondence to scorn. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) defended it, and raved at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). They were a
strange pair. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might be thirty-nine or forty, and was buxom and
blooming as a girl of twenty. Hard, loud, vain and vulgar, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind and
body alike seemed brazen and imperishable. I should think, from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
childhood, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must have lived in public stations; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) youth
might very likely have been a barmaid.

<p/>Towards morning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) discourse ran on a new theme: <div class="bookquote">``the Watsons,''  (<font color='red'><b>passengers</b></font>)</div>a
certain expected family-party of passengers, known to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), it appeared,
and by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) much esteemed on account of the handsome profit realized in
their fees. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It was as good as a little fortune to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
whenever this family crossed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>At dawn all were astir, and by sunrise the passengers came on board.
Boisterous was the welcome given by the stewardess to the <div class="bookquote">``Watsons,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the stewardess</b></font>)</div>and great was the bustle made in their honour. They were four in
number, two males and two females. Besides them, there was but one
other passenger--a young lady, whom a gentlemanly, though
languid-looking man escorted. The two groups offered a marked contrast.
The Watsons were doubtless rich people, for they had the confidence of
conscious wealth in their bearing; the women--youthful both of them,
and one perfectly handsome, as far as physical beauty went--were
dressed richly, gaily, and absurdly out of character for the
circumstances. Their bonnets with bright flowers, their velvet cloaks
and silk dresses, seemed better suited for park or promenade than for a
damp packet deck. The men were of low stature, plain, fat, and vulgar;
the oldest, plainest, greasiest, broadest, I soon found was the
husband--the bridegroom I suppose, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) was very young--of the
beautiful girl. Deep was my amazement at this discovery; and deeper
still when I perceived that, instead of being desperately wretched in
such a union, she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) was gay even to giddiness. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) laughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
reflected, <div class="bookquote">``must be the mere frenzy of despair.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And even while this
thought was crossing my mind, as I stood leaning quiet and solitary
against the ship's side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) came tripping up to me, an utter stranger,
with a camp-stool in her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) hand, and smiling a smile of which the levity
puzzled and startled me, though it showed a perfect set of perfect
teeth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) offered me the accommodation of this piece of furniture. I
declined it of course, with all the courtesy I could put into my
manner; she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) danced off heedless and lightsome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) must have been
good-natured; but what had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) marry that individual, who was at
least as much like an oil-barrel as a man?

<p/>The other lady passenger, with the gentleman-companion, was quite a
girl, pretty and fair: her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) simple print dress, untrimmed straw-bonnet
and large shawl, gracefully worn, formed a costume plain to quakerism:
yet, for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), becoming enough. Before the gentleman quitted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), I
observed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) throwing a glance of scrutiny over all the passengers, as
if to ascertain in what company his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) charge would be left. With a most
dissatisfied air did his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye turn from the ladies with the gay flowers;
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked at me, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) daughter, niece, or whatever
she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was: she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) also glanced in my direction, and slightly curled her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
short, pretty lip. It might be myself, or it might be my homely
mourning habit, that elicited this mark of contempt; more likely, both.
A bell rang; her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) father -LRB-I afterwards knew that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) father-RRB-
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and returned to land. The packet sailed.

<p/>Foreigners say that it is only English girls who can thus be trusted to
travel alone, and deep is their wonder at the daring confidence of
English parents and guardians. As for the <div class="bookquote">``jeunes Meess,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>by some their
intrepidity is pronounced masculine and <div class="bookquote">``inconvenant,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>others regard
them as the passive victims of an educational and theological system
which wantonly dispenses with proper <div class="bookquote">``surveillance.''  (<font color='red'><b>the victims</b></font>)</div>Whether this
particular young lady was of the sort that can the most safely be left
unwatched, I do not know: or, rather did not _then_ know; but it soon
appeared that the dignity of solitude was not to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) taste. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paced
the deck once or twice backwards and forwards; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked with a little
sour air of disdain at the flaunting silks and velvets, and the bears
which thereon danced attendance, and eventually she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) approached me and
spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you fond of a sea-voyage?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) question.

<p/>I explained that my _fondness_ for a sea-voyage had yet to undergo the
test of experience; I had never made one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how charming!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I quite envy you the novelty: first
impressions, you know, are so pleasant. Now I have made so many, I
quite forget the first: I am quite _blasée_ about the sea and all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you laugh at me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) inquired, with a frank testiness that
pleased me better than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) other talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are so young to be _blasée_ about anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am seventeen''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-a little piqued-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You hardly look sixteen. Do you like travelling alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! I care nothing about it. I have crossed the Channel ten times,
alone; but then I take care never to be long alone: I always make
friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will scarcely make many friends this voyage, I think''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-glancing at
the Watson-group, who were now laughing and making a great deal of
noise on deck-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not of those odious men and women,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``such people should be
steerage passengers. Are you going to school?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the least idea--beyond, at least, the port of Boue-Marine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stared, then carelessly ran on:

<p/>``I am going to school. Oh, the number of foreign schools I have been at
in my life! And yet I am quite an ignoramus. I know nothing--nothing in
the world--I assure you; except that I play and dance beautifully,--and
French and German of course I know, to speak; but I can't read or write
them very well. Do you know they wanted me to translate a page of an
easy German book into English the other day, and I couldn't do it. Papa
was so mortified: he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) says it looks as if M. de Bassompierre--my
godpapa, who pays all my school-bills--had thrown away all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) money.
And then, in matters of information--in history, geography, arithmetic,
and so on, I am quite a baby; and I write English so badly--such
spelling and grammar, they tell me. Into the bargain I have quite
forgotten my religion; they call me a Protestant, you know, but really
I am not sure whether I am one or not: I don't well know the difference
between Romanism and Protestantism. However, I don't in the least care
for that. I was a Lutheran once at Bonn--dear Bonn!--charming
Bonn!--where there were so many handsome students. Every nice girl in
our school had an admirer; they knew our hours for walking out, and
almost always passed us on the promenade: ``Schönes Mädchen,<div class="bookquote">'' we used to
hear them say. I was excessively happy at Bonn!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where are you now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! at--_chose_,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>Now, Miss Ginevra Fanshawe -LRB-such was this young person's name-RRB- only
substituted this word <div class="bookquote">''_chose_''  (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div>in temporary oblivion of the real name.
It was a habit she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had: <div class="bookquote">''_chose_''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>came in at every turn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
conversation--the convenient substitute for any missing word in any
language she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) might chance at the time to be speaking. French girls
often do the like; from them she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had caught the custom. <div class="bookquote">''_Chose_,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>however, I found in this instance, stood for Villette--the great
capital of the great kingdom of Labassecour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like Villette?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well. The natives, you know, are intensely stupid and vulgar;
but there are some nice English families.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in a school?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! horrid: but I go out every Sunday, and care nothing about the
_maîtresses_ or the _professeurs_, or the _élèves_, and send lessons
_au diable_ -LRB-one daren't say that in English, you know, but it sounds
quite right in French-RRB-; and thus I get on charmingly... You are
laughing at me again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I am only smiling at my own thoughts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Without waiting for an answer-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``Now, _do_ tell me
where you are going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where Fate may lead me. My business is to earn a living where I can
find it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To earn!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-in consternation-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``are you poor, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As poor as Job.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-After a pause-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``Bah! how unpleasant! But _I_ know what it is to be
poor: they are poor enough at home--papa and mamma, and all of them.
Papa is called Captain Fanshawe; he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is an officer on half-pay, but
well-descended, and some of our connections are great enough; but my
uncle and godpapa De Bassompierre, who lives in France, is the only one
that helps us: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) educates us girls. I have five sisters and three
brothers. By-and-by we are to marry--rather elderly gentlemen, I
suppose, with cash: papa and mamma manage that. My sister Augusta is
married now to a man much older-looking than papa. Augusta is very
beautiful--not in my style--but dark; her (<font color='blue'><b>Augusta</b></font>) husband, Mr. Davies, had the
yellow fever in India, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) is still the colour of a guinea; but then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) is rich, and Augusta has her (<font color='blue'><b>Augusta</b></font>) carriage and establishment, and we all
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Augusta</b></font>) has done perfectly well. Now, this is better than `earning a
living,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as you say. By the way, are you clever?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can play, sing, speak three or four languages?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still I think you are clever''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-a pause and a yawn-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you be sea-sick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, immensely! as soon as ever we get in sight of the sea: I begin,
indeed, to feel it already. I shall go below; and won't I order about
that fat odious stewardess! Heureusement je sais faire aller mon monde.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Down she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) went.

<p/>It was not long before the other passengers followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>): throughout
the afternoon I remained on deck alone. When I recall the tranquil, and
even happy mood in which I passed those hours, and remember, at the
same time, the position in which I was placed; its hazardous--some
would have said its hopeless--character; I feel that, as--

<p/>Stone walls do not a prison make,
Nor iron bars--a cage,

<p/>so peril, loneliness, an uncertain future, are not oppressive evils, so
long as the frame is healthy and the faculties are employed; so long,
especially, as Liberty lends us her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wings, and Hope guides us by her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
star.

<p/>I was not sick till long after we passed Margate, and deep was the
pleasure I drank in with the sea-breeze; divine the delight I drew from
the heaving Channel waves, from the sea-birds on their ridges, from the
white sails on their dark distance, from the quiet yet beclouded sky,
overhanging all. In my reverie, methought I saw the continent of
Europe, like a wide dream-land, far away. Sunshine lay on it, making
the long coast one line of gold; tiniest tracery of clustered town and
snow-gleaming tower, of woods deep massed, of heights serrated, of
smooth pasturage and veiny stream, embossed the metal-bright prospect.
For background, spread a sky, solemn and dark blue, and--grand with
imperial promise, soft with tints of enchantment--strode from north to
south a God-bent bow, an arch of hope.

<p/>Cancel the whole of that, if you please, reader--or rather let it
stand, and draw thence a moral--an alliterative, text-hand copy--

<p/>Day-dreams are delusions of the demon.

<p/>Becoming excessively sick, I faltered down into the cabin.

<p/>Miss Fanshawe's berth chanced to be next mine; and, I am sorry to say,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) tormented me with an unsparing selfishness during the whole time of
our mutual distress. Nothing could exceed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) impatience and
fretfulness. The Watsons, who were very sick too, and on whom the
stewardess attended with shameless partiality, were stoics compared
with her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>). Many a time since have I noticed, in persons of Ginevra
Fanshawe's light, careless temperament, and fair, fragile style of
beauty, an entire incapacity to endure: they seem to sour in adversity,
like small beer in thunder. The man who takes such a woman for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife, ought to be prepared to guarantee her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) an existence all sunshine.
Indignant at last with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) teasing peevishness, I curtly requested her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) tongue.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The rebuff did her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) good, and it was observable
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked me no worse for it.

<p/>As dark night drew on, the sea roughened: larger waves swayed strong
against the vessel's side. It was strange to reflect that blackness and
water were round us, and to feel the ship ploughing straight on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
pathless way, despite noise, billow, and rising gale. Articles of
furniture began to fall about, and it became needful to lash them to
their places; the passengers grew sicker than ever; Miss Fanshawe
declared, with groans, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) must die.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not just yet, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stewardess</b></font>)</div>said the stewardess. <div class="bookquote">``We're just in port.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Accordingly, in another quarter of an hour, a calm fell upon us all;
and about midnight the voyage ended.

<p/>I was sorry: yes, I was sorry. My resting-time was past; my
difficulties--my stringent difficulties--recommenced. When I went on
deck, the cold air and black scowl of the night seemed to rebuke me for
my presumption in being where I was: the lights of the foreign sea-port
town, glimmering round the foreign harbour, met me like unnumbered
threatening eyes. Friends came on board to welcome the Watsons; a whole
family of friends surrounded and bore away Miss Fanshawe; I--but I
dared not for one moment dwell on a comparison of positions.

<p/>Yet where should I go? I must go somewhere. Necessity dare not be nice.
As I gave the stewardess her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) fee--and she (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) seemed surprised at receiving
a coin of more value than, from such a quarter, her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) coarse calculations
had probably reckoned on--I said, <div class="bookquote">``Be kind enough to direct me to some
quiet, respectable inn, where I can go for the night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) not only gave me the required direction, but called a
commissionaire, and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) take charge of me, and--_not_ my trunk, for
that was gone to the custom-house.

<p/>I followed this man along a rudely-paved street, lit now by a fitful
gleam of moonlight; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought me to the inn. I offered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sixpence,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) refused to take; supposing it not enough, I changed it for a
shilling; but this also he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declined, speaking rather sharply, in a
language to me unknown. A waiter, coming forward into the lamp-lit
inn-passage, reminded me, in broken English, that my money was foreign
money, not current here. I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) a sovereign to change. This little
matter settled, I asked for a bedroom; supper I could not take: I was
still sea-sick and unnerved, and trembling all over. How deeply glad I
was when the door of a very small chamber at length closed on me and my
exhaustion. Again I might rest: though the cloud of doubt would be as
thick to-morrow as ever; the necessity for exertion more urgent, the
peril -LRB-of destitution-RRB- nearer, the conflict -LRB-for existence-RRB- more severe.




<p/>CHAPTER VII.

<p/>VILLETTE.


<p/>I awoke next morning with courage revived and spirits refreshed:
physical debility no longer enervated my judgment; my mind felt prompt
and clear.

<p/>Just as I finished dressing, a tap came to the door: I said, <div class="bookquote">``Come in,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>expecting the chambermaid, whereas a rough man walked in and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gif me your keys, Meess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gif!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impatiently; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) half-snatched them from my hand,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``All right! haf your tronc soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fortunately it did turn out all right: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was from the custom-house.
Where to go to get some breakfast I could not tell; but I proceeded,
not without hesitation, to descend.

<p/>I now observed, what I had not noticed in my extreme weariness last
night, viz. that this inn was, in fact, a large hotel; and as I slowly
descended the broad staircase, halting on each step -LRB-for I was in
wonderfully little haste to get down-RRB-, I gazed at the high ceiling
above me, at the painted walls around, at the wide windows which filled
the house with light, at the veined marble I trod -LRB-for the steps were
all of marble, though uncarpeted and not very clean-RRB-, and contrasting
all this with the dimensions of the closet assigned to me as a chamber,
with the extreme modesty of its appointments, I fell into a
philosophizing mood.

<p/>Much I marvelled at the sagacity evinced by waiters and chamber-maids
in proportioning the accommodation to the guest. How could inn-servants
and ship-stewardesses everywhere tell at a glance that I, for instance,
was an individual of no social significance, and little burdened by
cash? They _did_ know it evidently: I saw quite well that they all, in
a moment's calculation, estimated me at about the same fractional
value. The fact seemed to me curious and pregnant: I would not disguise
from myself what it indicated, yet managed to keep up my spirits pretty
well under its pressure.

<p/>Having at last landed in a great hall, full of skylight glare, I made
my way somehow to what proved to be the coffee-room. It cannot be
denied that on entering this room I trembled somewhat; felt uncertain,
solitary, wretched; wished to Heaven I knew whether I was doing right
or wrong; felt convinced that it was the last, but could not help
myself. Acting in the spirit and with the calm of a fatalist, I sat
down at a small table, to which a waiter presently brought me some
breakfast; and I partook of that meal in a frame of mind not greatly
calculated to favour digestion. There were many other people
breakfasting at other tables in the room; I should have felt rather
more happy if amongst them all I could have seen any women; however,
there was not one--all present were men. But nobody seemed to think I
was doing anything strange; one or two gentlemen glanced at me
occasionally, but none stared obtrusively: I suppose if there was
anything eccentric in the business, they accounted for it by this word
<div class="bookquote">``Anglaise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Breakfast over, I must again move--in what direction? <div class="bookquote">``Go to Villette,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginevra/Miss Fanshawe/Ginevra Fanshawe</b></font>)</div>said an inward voice; prompted doubtless by the recollection of this
slight sentence uttered carelessly and at random by Miss Fanshawe, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) bid me good-by: <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would come to Madame Beck's; she (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) has
some marmots whom you might look after; she (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) wants an English
gouvernante, or was wanting one two months ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Who Madame Beck was, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) lived, I knew not; I had asked, but the
question passed unheard: Miss Fanshawe, hurried away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) friends,
left it unanswered. I presumed Villette to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) residence--to
Villette I would go. The distance was forty miles. I knew I was
catching at straws; but in the wide and weltering deep where I found
myself, I would have caught at cobwebs. Having inquired about the means
of travelling to Villette, and secured a seat in the diligence, I
departed on the strength of this outline--this shadow of a project.
Before you pronounce on the rashness of the proceeding, reader, look
back to the point whence I started; consider the desert I had left,
note how little I perilled: mine was the game where the player cannot
lose and may win.

<p/>Of an artistic temperament, I deny that I am; yet I must possess
something of the artist's faculty of making the most of present
pleasure: that is to say, when it is of the kind to my taste. I enjoyed
that day, though we travelled slowly, though it was cold, though it
rained. Somewhat bare, flat, and treeless was the route along which our
journey lay; and slimy canals crept, like half-torpid green snakes,
beside the road; and formal pollard willows edged level fields, tilled
like kitchen-garden beds. The sky, too, was monotonously gray; the
atmosphere was stagnant and humid; yet amidst all these deadening
influences, my fancy budded fresh and my heart basked in sunshine.
These feelings, however, were well kept in check by the secret but
ceaseless consciousness of anxiety lying in wait on enjoyment, like a
tiger crouched in a jungle. The breathing of that beast of prey was in
my ear always; his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) fierce heart panted close against mine; he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) never
stirred in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) lair but I felt him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>): I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) waited only for sun-down
to bound ravenous from his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) ambush.

<p/>I had hoped we might reach Villette ere night set in, and that thus I
might escape the deeper embarrassment which obscurity seems to throw
round a first arrival at an unknown bourne; but, what with our slow
progress and long stoppages--what with a thick fog and small, dense
rain--darkness, that might almost be felt, had settled on the city by
the time we gained its suburbs.

<p/>I know we passed through a gate where soldiers were stationed--so much
I could see by lamplight; then, having left behind us the miry
Chaussée, we rattled over a pavement of strangely rough and flinty
surface. At a bureau, the diligence stopped, and the passengers
alighted. My first business was to get my trunk; a small matter enough,
but important to me. Understanding that it was best not to be
importunate or over-eager about luggage, but to wait and watch quietly
the delivery of other boxes till I saw my own, and then promptly claim
and secure it, I stood apart; my eye fixed on that part of the vehicle
in which I had seen my little portmanteau safely stowed, and upon which
piles of additional bags and boxes were now heaped. One by one, I saw
these removed, lowered, and seized on.

<p/>I was sure mine ought to be by this time visible: it was not. I had
tied on the direction-card with a piece of green ribbon, that I might
know it at a glance: not a fringe or fragment of green was perceptible.
Every package was removed; every tin-case and brown-paper parcel; the
oilcloth cover was lifted; I saw with distinct vision that not an
umbrella, cloak, cane, hat-box or band-box remained.

<p/>And my portmanteau, with my few clothes and little pocket-book
enclasping the remnant of my fifteen pounds, where were they?

<p/>I ask this question now, but I could not ask it then. I could say
nothing whatever; not possessing a phrase of _speaking_ French: and it
was French, and French only, the whole world seemed now gabbling around
me. _What_ should I do? Approaching the conductor, I just laid my hand
on his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) arm, pointed to a trunk, thence to the diligence-roof, and
tried to express a question with my eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) misunderstood me, seized
the trunk indicated, and was about to hoist it on the vehicle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let that alone--will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice in good English; then, in
correction, <div class="bookquote">``Qu'est-ce que vous faîtes donc? Cette malle est à moi.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I had heard the Fatherland accents; they rejoiced my heart; I
turned: <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, appealing to the stranger, without, in my
distress, noticing what he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was like, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot speak French. May I
entreat you to ask this man what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done with my trunk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Without discriminating, for the moment, what sort of face it was to
which my eyes were raised and on which they were fixed, I felt in its
expression half-surprise at my appeal and half-doubt of the wisdom of
interference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Do_ ask him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>); I would do as much for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>I don't know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) smiled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said in a gentlemanly tone--that
is to say, a tone not hard nor terrifying,--<div class="bookquote">``What sort of trunk was
yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I described it, including in my description the green ribbon. And
forthwith he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) took the conductor under hand, and I felt, through all the
storm of French which followed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) raked him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) fore and aft.
Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) returned to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fellow avers he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was overloaded, and confesses that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) removed your
trunk after you saw it put on, and has left it behind at Boue-Marine
with other parcels; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has promised, however, to forward it to-morrow;
the day after, therefore, you will find it safe at this bureau.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I: but my heart sank.

<p/>Meantime what should I do? Perhaps this English gentleman saw the
failure of courage in my face; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inquired kindly, <div class="bookquote">``Have you any
friends in this city?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, and I don't know where to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little pause, in the course of which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned more
fully to the light of a lamp above him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a young,
distinguished, and handsome man; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might be a lord, for anything I
knew: nature had made him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) good enough for a prince, I thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face
was very pleasant; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked high but not arrogant, manly but not
overbearing. I was turning away, in the deep consciousness of all
absence of claim to look for further help from such a one as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was all your money in your trunk?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked, stopping me.

<p/>How thankful was I to be able to answer with truth--<div class="bookquote">``No. I have enough
in my purse''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for I had near twenty francs-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``to keep me at a quiet inn
till the day after to-morrow; but I am quite a stranger in Villette,
and don't know the streets and the inns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give you the address of such an inn as you want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and
it is not far off: with my direction you will easily find it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tore a leaf from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket-book, wrote a few words and gave it to
me. I _did_ think him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) kind; and as to distrusting him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), or his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) advice,
or his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) address, I should almost as soon have thought of distrusting the
Bible. There was goodness in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) countenance, and honour in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bright
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your shortest way will be to follow the Boulevard and cross the park,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``but it is too late and too dark for a woman to go
through the park alone; I will step with you thus far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) moved on, and I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), through the darkness and the small
soaking rain. The Boulevard was all deserted, its path miry, the water
dripping from its trees; the park was black as midnight. In the double
gloom of trees and fog, I could not see my guide; I could only follow
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tread. Not the least fear had I: I believe I would have followed
that frank tread, through continual night, to the world's end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), when the park was traversed, <div class="bookquote">``you will go along this
broad street till you come to steps; two lamps will show you where they
are: these steps you will descend: a narrower street lies below;
following that, at the bottom you will find your inn. They speak
English there, so your difficulties are now pretty well over.
Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I: <div class="bookquote">``accept my sincerest thanks.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And we parted.

<p/>The remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) countenance, which I am sure wore a light not
unbenignant to the friendless--the sound in my ear of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voice, which
spoke a nature chivalric to the needy and feeble, as well as the
youthful and fair--were a sort of cordial to me long after. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a
true young English gentleman.

<p/>On I went, hurrying fast through a magnificent street and square, with
the grandest houses round, and amidst them the huge outline of more
than one overbearing pile; which might be palace or church--I could not
tell. Just as I passed a portico, two mustachioed men came suddenly
from behind the pillars; they were smoking cigars: their dress implied
pretensions to the rank of gentlemen, but, poor things! they were very
plebeian in soul. They spoke with insolence, and, fast as I walked,
they kept pace with me a long way. At last I met a sort of patrol, and
my dreaded hunters were turned from the pursuit; but they had driven me
beyond my reckoning: when I could collect my faculties, I no longer
knew where I was; the staircase I must long since have passed. Puzzled,
out of breath, all my pulses throbbing in inevitable agitation, I knew
not where to turn. It was terrible to think of again encountering those
bearded, sneering simpletons; yet the ground must be retraced, and the
steps sought out.

<p/>I came at last to an old and worn flight, and, taking it for granted
that this must be the one indicated, I descended them. The street into
which they led was indeed narrow, but it contained no inn. On I
wandered. In a very quiet and comparatively clean and well-paved
street, I saw a light burning over the door of a rather large house,
loftier by a story than those round it. _This_ might be the inn at
last. I hastened on: my knees now trembled under me: I was getting
quite exhausted.

<p/>No inn was this. A brass-plate embellished the great porte-cochère:
<div class="bookquote">``Pensionnat de Demoiselles''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was the inscription; and beneath, a name,
<div class="bookquote">``Madame Beck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I started. About a hundred thoughts volleyed through my mind in a
moment. Yet I planned nothing, and considered nothing: I had not time.
Providence said, <div class="bookquote">``Stop here; this is _your_ inn.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Fate took me in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
strong hand; mastered my will; directed my actions: I rang the
door-bell.

<p/>While I waited, I would not reflect. I fixedly looked at the
street-stones, where the door-lamp shone, and counted them and noted
their shapes, and the glitter of wet on their angles. I rang again.
They opened at last. A bonne in a smart cap stood before me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I see Madame Beck?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/>I believe if I had spoken French she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would not have admitted me; but,
as I spoke English, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) concluded I was a foreign teacher come on
business connected with the pensionnat, and, even at that late hour,
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) let me in, without a word of reluctance, or a moment of hesitation.

<p/>The next moment I sat in a cold, glittering salon, with porcelain
stove, unlit, and gilded ornaments, and polished floor. A pendule on
the mantel-piece struck nine o'clock.

<p/>A quarter of an hour passed. How fast beat every pulse in my frame! How
I turned cold and hot by turns! I sat with my eyes fixed on the door--a
great white folding-door, with gilt mouldings: I watched to see a leaf
move and open. All had been quiet: not a mouse had stirred; the white
doors were closed and motionless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ayre Engliss?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice at my elbow. I almost bounded, so
unexpected was the sound; so certain had I been of solitude.

<p/>No ghost stood beside me, nor anything of spectral aspect; merely a
motherly, dumpy little woman, in a large shawl, a wrapping-gown, and a
clean, trim nightcap.

<p/>I said I was English, and immediately, without further prelude, we fell
to a most remarkable conversation. Madame Beck -LRB-for Madame Beck it
was--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had entered by a little door behind me, and, being shod with
the shoes of silence, I had heard neither her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entrance nor
approach-RRB---Madame Beck had exhausted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) command of insular speech when
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You ayre Engliss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now proceeded to work away
volubly in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own tongue. I answered in mine. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) partly understood
me, but as I did not at all understand her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--though we made together an
awful clamour -LRB-anything like Madame's gift of utterance I had not
hitherto heard or imagined-RRB---we achieved little progress. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rang, ere
long, for aid; which arrived in the shape of a <div class="bookquote">``maîtresse,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>who had
been partly educated in an Irish convent, and was esteemed a perfect
adept in the English language. A bluff little personage this maîtresse
was--Labassecourienne from top to toe: and how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did slaughter the
speech of Albion! However, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a plain tale, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
translated. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) how I had left my own country, intent on
extending my knowledge, and gaining my bread; how I was ready to turn
my hand to any useful thing, provided it was not wrong or degrading;
how I would be a child's-nurse, or a lady's-maid, and would not refuse
even housework adapted to my strength. Madame heard this; and,
questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) countenance, I almost thought the tale won her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) ear:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Il n'y a que les Anglaises pour ces sortes d'entreprises,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>):
<div class="bookquote">``sont-elles donc intrépides ces femmes là!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) asked my name, my age; she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) sat and looked at me--not pityingly, not
with interest: never a gleam of sympathy, or a shade of compassion,
crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) countenance during the interview. I felt she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was not one to
be led an inch by her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) feelings: grave and considerate, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) gazed,
consulting her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) judgment and studying my narrative. A bell rang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Voilà pour la prière du soir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and rose. Through her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
interpreter, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) desired me to depart now, and come back on the morrow;
but this did not suit me: I could not bear to return to the perils of
darkness and the street. With energy, yet with a collected and
controlled manner, I said, addressing herself personally, and not the
maîtresse: <div class="bookquote">``Be assured, madame, that by instantly securing my services,
your interests will be served and not injured: you will find me one who
will wish to give, in her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) labour, a full equivalent for her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) wages; and
if you hire me, it will be better that I should stay here this night:
having no acquaintance in Villette, and not possessing the language of
the country, how can I secure a lodging?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but at least you can give a reference?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) inquired after my luggage: I told her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) when it would arrive. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
mused. At that moment a man's step was heard in the vestibule, hastily
proceeding to the outer door. -LRB-I shall go on with this part of my tale
as if I had understood all that passed; for though it was then scarce
intelligible to me, I heard it translated afterwards-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who goes out now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Beck/Beck</b></font>)</div>demanded Madame Beck, listening to the tread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``M. Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>the teacher</b></font>)</div>replied the teacher. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came this evening to give a reading
to the first class.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very man I should at this moment most wish to see. Call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The teacher</b></font>)</div><p/>The teacher ran to the salon door. M. Paul was summoned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) entered: a
small, dark and spare man, in spectacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mon cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>began Madame, <div class="bookquote">``I want your opinion. We know your skill in
physiognomy; use it now. Read that countenance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>The little man fixed on me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spectacles: A resolute compression of
the lips, and gathering of the brow, seemed to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant to see
through me, and that a veil would be no veil for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pronounced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Et qu'en dites vous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais--bien des choses,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the oracular answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad or good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of each kind, without doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the diviner</b></font>)</div>pursued the diviner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May one trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you negotiating a matter of importance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wishes me to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as bonne or gouvernante; tells a tale full
of integrity, but gives no reference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is a stranger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An Englishwoman, as one may see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) speaks French?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) understands it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One may then speak plainly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) presence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubtless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gazed steadily. <div class="bookquote">``Do you need her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) services?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could do with them. You know I am disgusted with Madame Svini.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scrutinized. The judgment, when it at last came, was as
indefinite as what had gone before it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>). If good predominates in that nature, the action will bring
its own reward; if evil--eh bien! ma cousine, ce sera toujours une
bonne oeuvre.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And with a bow and a <div class="bookquote">``bon soir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>this vague arbiter of
my destiny vanished.

<p/>And Madame did engage me that very night--by God's blessing I was
spared the necessity of passing forth again into the lonesome, dreary,
hostile street.




<p/>CHAPTER VIII.

<p/>MADAME BECK.


<p/>Being delivered into the charge of the maîtresse, I was led through a
long narrow passage into a foreign kitchen, very clean but very
strange. It seemed to contain no means of cooking--neither fireplace
nor oven; I did not understand that the great black furnace which
filled one corner, was an efficient substitute for these. Surely pride
was not already beginning its whispers in my heart; yet I felt a sense
of relief when, instead of being left in the kitchen, as I half
anticipated, I was led forward to a small inner room termed a
<div class="bookquote">``cabinet.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A cook in a jacket, a short petticoat and sabots, brought my
supper: to wit--some meat, nature unknown, served in an odd and acid,
but pleasant sauce; some chopped potatoes, made savoury with, I know
not what: vinegar and sugar, I think: a tartine, or slice of bread and
butter, and a baked pear. Being hungry, I ate and was grateful.

<p/>After the <div class="bookquote">``prière du soir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame herself came to have another look at
me. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) desired me to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) up-stairs. Through a series of the
queerest little dormitories--which, I heard afterwards, had once been
nuns' cells: for the premises were in part of ancient date--and through
the oratory--a long, low, gloomy room, where a crucifix hung, pale,
against the wall, and two tapers kept dim vigils--she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) conducted me to
an apartment where three children were asleep in three tiny beds. A
heated stove made the air of this room oppressive; and, to mend
matters, it was scented with an odour rather strong than delicate: a
perfume, indeed, altogether surprising and unexpected under the
circumstances, being like the combination of smoke with some spirituous
essence--a smell, in short, of whisky.

<p/>Beside a table, on which flared the remnant of a candle guttering to
waste in the socket, a coarse woman, heterogeneously clad in a broad
striped showy silk dress, and a stuff apron, sat in a chair fast
asleep. To complete the picture, and leave no doubt as to the state of
matters, a bottle and an empty glass stood at the sleeping beauty's
elbow.

<p/>Madame contemplated this remarkable tableau with great calm; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
neither smiled nor scowled; no impress of anger, disgust, or surprise,
ruffled the equality of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grave aspect; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not even wake the
woman! Serenely pointing to a fourth bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) intimated that it was to
be mine; then, having extinguished the candle and substituted for it a
night-lamp, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glided through an inner door, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left ajar--the
entrance to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own chamber, a large, well-furnished apartment; as was
discernible through the aperture.

<p/>My devotions that night were all thanksgiving. Strangely had I been led
since morning--unexpectedly had I been provided for. Scarcely could I
believe that not forty-eight hours had elapsed since I left London,
under no other guardianship than that which protects the
passenger-bird--with no prospect but the dubious cloud-tracery of hope.

<p/>I was a light sleeper; in the dead of night I suddenly awoke. All was
hushed, but a white figure stood in the room--Madame in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
night-dress. Moving without perceptible sound, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) visited the three
children in the three beds; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) approached me: I feigned sleep, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
studied me long. A small pantomime ensued, curious enough. I daresay
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat a quarter of an hour on the edge of my bed, gazing at my face.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) then drew nearer, bent close over me; slightly raised my cap, and
turned back the border so as to expose my hair; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at my hand
lying on the bedclothes. This done, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned to the chair where my
clothes lay: it was at the foot of the bed. Hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) touch and lift
them, I opened my eyes with precaution, for I own I felt curious to see
how far her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) taste for research would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). It led her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a good way:
every article did she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) inspect. I divined her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) motive for this
proceeding, viz. the wish to form from the garments a judgment
respecting the wearer, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) station, means, neatness, &c. The end was
not bad, but the means were hardly fair or justifiable. In my dress was
a pocket; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fairly turned it inside out: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) counted the money in my
purse; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) opened a little memorandum-book, coolly perused its
contents, and took from between the leaves a small plaited lock of Miss
Marchmont's grey hair. To a bunch of three keys, being those of my
trunk, desk, and work-box, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) accorded special attention: with these,
indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) withdrew a moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own room. I softly rose in my bed
and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with my eye: these keys, reader, were not brought back
till they had left on the toilet of the adjoining room the impress of
their wards in wax. All being thus done decently and in order, my
property was returned to its place, my clothes were carefully refolded.
Of what nature were the conclusions deduced from this scrutiny? Were
they favourable or otherwise? Vain question. Madame's face of stone
-LRB-for of stone in its present night aspect it looked: it had been human,
and, as I said before, motherly, in the salon-RRB- betrayed no response.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) duty done--I felt that in her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) eyes this business was a duty--she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
rose, noiseless as a shadow: she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) moved towards her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) own chamber; at the
door, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) turned, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) eye on the heroine of the bottle, who
still slept and loudly snored. Mrs. Svini -LRB-I presume this was Mrs.
Svini, Anglicé or Hibernicé, Sweeny-RRB---Mrs. Sweeny's doom was in Madame
Beck's eye--an immutable purpose that eye spoke: Madame's visitations
for shortcomings might be slow, but they were sure. All this was very
un-English: truly I was in a foreign land.

<p/>The morrow made me further acquainted with Mrs. Sweeny. It seems she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)
had introduced herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) present employer as an English lady in
reduced circumstances: a native, indeed, of Middlesex, professing to
speak the English tongue with the purest metropolitan accent.
Madame--reliant on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) own infallible expedients for finding out the
truth in time--had a singular intrepidity in hiring service off-hand
-LRB-as indeed seemed abundantly proved in my own case-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) received Mrs.
Sweeny as nursery-governess to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) three children. I need hardly
explain to the reader that this lady was in effect a native of Ireland;
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) station I do not pretend to fix: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) boldly declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
<div class="bookquote">``had the bringing-up of the son and daughter of a marquis.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I think
myself, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might possibly have been a hanger-on, nurse, fosterer, or
washerwoman, in some Irish family: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke a smothered tongue,
curiously overlaid with mincing cockney inflections. By some means or
other she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had acquired, and now held in possession, a wardrobe of
rather suspicious splendour--gowns of stiff and costly silk, fitting
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) indifferently, and apparently made for other proportions than those
they now adorned; caps with real lace borders, and--the chief item in
the inventory, the spell by which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) struck a certain awe through the
household, quelling the otherwise scornfully disposed teachers and
servants, and, so long as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) broad shoulders _wore_ the folds of that
majestic drapery, even influencing Madame herself--_a real Indian
shawl_--<div class="bookquote">``un véritable cachemire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>as Madame Beck said, with unmixed
reverence and amaze. I feel quite sure that without this <div class="bookquote">``cachemire''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) footing in the pensionnat for two days: by
virtue of it, and it only, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) maintained the same a month.

<p/>But when Mrs. Sweeny knew that I was come to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) shoes, then it
was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) declared herself--then did she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) rise on Madame Beck in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)
full power--then come down on me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) concentrated weight. Madame
bore this revelation and visitation so well, so stoically, that I for
very shame could not support it otherwise than with composure. For one
little moment Madame Beck absented herself from the room; ten minutes
after, an agent of the police stood in the midst of us. Mrs. Sweeny and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) effects were removed. Madame's brow had not been ruffled during the
scene--her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) lips had not dropped one sharply-accented word.

<p/>This brisk little affair of the dismissal was all settled before
breakfast: order to march given, policeman called, mutineer expelled;
<div class="bookquote">``chambre d'enfans''  (<font color='red'><b>mutineer</b></font>)</div>fumigated and cleansed, windows thrown open, and
every trace of the accomplished Mrs. Sweeny--even to the fine essence
and spiritual fragrance which gave token so subtle and so fatal of the
head and front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) offending--was annihilated from the Rue Fossette:
all this, I say, was done between the moment of Madame Beck's issuing
like Aurora from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) chamber, and that in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) coolly sat down to
pour out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) first cup of coffee.

<p/>About noon, I was summoned to dress Madame. -LRB-It appeared my place was
to be a hybrid between gouvernante and lady's-maid.-RRB- Till noon, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
haunted the house in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) wrapping-gown, shawl, and soundless slippers.
How would the lady-chief of an English school approve this custom?

<p/>The dressing of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hair puzzled me; she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had plenty of it: auburn,
unmixed with grey: though she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was forty years old. Seeing my
embarrassment, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You have not been a femme-de-chambre in your
own country?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And taking the brush from my hand, and setting me aside,
not ungently or disrespectfully, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) arranged it herself. In performing
other offices of the toilet, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) half-directed, half-aided me, without
the least display of temper or impatience. N.B.--That was the first and
last time I was required to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). Henceforth, on Rosine, the
portress, devolved that duty.

<p/>When attired, Madame Beck appeared a personage of a figure rather short
and stout, yet still graceful in its own peculiar way; that is, with
the grace resulting from proportion of parts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) complexion was fresh
and sanguine, not too rubicund; her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) eye, blue and serene; her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) dark silk
dress fitted her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) as a French sempstress alone can make a dress fit; she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
looked well, though a little bourgeoise; as bourgeoise, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
was. I know not what of harmony pervaded her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) whole person; and yet her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
face offered contrast, too: its features were by no means such as are
usually seen in conjunction with a complexion of such blended freshness
and repose: their outline was stern: her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) forehead was high but narrow;
it expressed capacity and some benevolence, but no expanse; nor did her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
peaceful yet watchful eye ever know the fire which is kindled in the
heart or the softness which flows thence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mouth was hard: it could
be a little grim; her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lips were thin. For sensibility and genius, with
all their tenderness and temerity, I felt somehow that Madame would be
the right sort of Minos in petticoats.

<p/>In the long run, I found she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was something else in petticoats too. Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
name was Modeste Maria Beck, née Kint: it ought to have been Ignacia.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) was a charitable woman, and did a great deal of good. There never
was a mistress whose rule was milder. I was told that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) never once
remonstrated with the intolerable Mrs. Sweeny, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) tipsiness,
disorder, and general neglect; yet Mrs. Sweeny had to go the moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)
departure became convenient. I was told, too, that neither masters nor
teachers were found fault with in that establishment; yet both masters
and teachers were often changed: they vanished and others filled their
places, none could well explain how.

<p/>The establishment was both a pensionnat and an externat: the externes
or day-pupils exceeded one hundred in number; the boarders were about a
score. Madame must have possessed high administrative powers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) ruled
all these, together with four teachers, eight masters, six servants,
and three children, managing at the same time to perfection the pupils'
parents and friends; and that without apparent effort; without bustle,
fatigue, fever, or any symptom of undue, excitement: occupied she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)
always was--busy, rarely. It is true that Madame had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) own system for
managing and regulating this mass of machinery; and a very pretty
system it was: the reader has seen a specimen of it, in that small
affair of turning my pocket inside out, and reading my private
memoranda. <div class="bookquote">``Surveillance,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``espionage,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--these were her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) watchwords.

<p/>Still, Madame knew what honesty was, and liked it--that is, when it did
not obtrude its clumsy scruples in the way of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) will and interest.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) had a respect for <div class="bookquote">``Angleterre;''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and as to <div class="bookquote">``les Anglaises,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)
would have the women of no other country about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) own children, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)
could help it.

<p/>Often in the evening, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) had been plotting and counter-plotting,
spying and receiving the reports of spies all day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) would come up to
my room--a trace of real weariness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) brow--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) would sit down
and listen while the children said their little prayers to me in
English: the Lord's Prayer, and the hymn beginning <div class="bookquote">``Gentle Jesus,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Lord</b></font>)</div>these little Catholics were permitted to repeat at my knee; and, when I
had put them to bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) would talk to me -LRB-I soon gained enough French
to be able to understand, and even answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)-RRB- about England and
Englishwomen, and the reasons for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) was pleased to term their
superior intelligence, and more real and reliable probity. Very good
sense she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) often showed; very sound opinions she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) often broached: she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)
seemed to know that keeping girls in distrustful restraint, in blind
ignorance, and under a surveillance that left them no moment and no
corner for retirement, was not the best way to make them grow up honest
and modest women; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) averred that ruinous consequences would ensue
if any other method were tried with continental children: they were so
accustomed to restraint, that relaxation, however guarded, would be
misunderstood and fatally presumed on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) was sick, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) would declare,
of the means she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) had to use, but use them she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) must; and after
discoursing, often with dignity and delicacy, to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) would move
away on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``souliers de silence,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and glide ghost-like through the
house, watching and spying everywhere, peering through every keyhole,
listening behind every door.

<p/>After all, Madame's system was not bad--let me do her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) justice. Nothing
could be better than all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) arrangements for the physical well-being
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) scholars. No minds were overtasked: the lessons were well
distributed and made incomparably easy to the learner; there was a
liberty of amusement, and a provision for exercise which kept the girls
healthy; the food was abundant and good: neither pale nor puny faces
were anywhere to be seen in the Rue Fossette. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) never grudged a
holiday; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) allowed plenty of time for sleeping, dressing, washing,
eating; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) method in all these matters was easy, liberal, salutary,
and rational: many an austere English school-mistress would do vastly
well to imitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)--and I believe many would be glad to do so, if
exacting English parents would let them.

<p/>As Madame Beck ruled by espionage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) of course had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) staff of
spies: she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) perfectly knew the quality of the tools she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) used, and while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) would not scruple to handle the dirtiest for a dirty
occasion--flinging this sort from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) like refuse rind, after the
orange has been duly squeezed--I have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) fastidious in seeking
pure metal for clean uses; and when once a bloodless and rustless
instrument was found, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) was careful of the prize, keeping it in silk
and cotton-wool. Yet, woe be to that man or woman who relied on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) one
inch beyond the point where it was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) interest to be trustworthy:
interest was the master-key of Madame's nature--the mainspring of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
motives--the alpha and omega of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life. I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) _feelings_
appealed to, and I have smiled in half-pity, half-scorn at the
appellants. None ever gained her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ear through that channel, or swayed
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purpose by that means. On the contrary, to attempt to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
heart was the surest way to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) antipathy, and to make of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a
secret foe. It proved to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no heart to be touched: it
reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was impotent and dead. Never was the distinction
between charity and mercy better exemplified than in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). While devoid
of sympathy, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a sufficiency of rational benevolence: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
give in the readiest manner to people she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never seen--rather,
however, to classes than to individuals. <div class="bookquote">``Pour les pauvres,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opened
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purse freely--against _the poor man_, as a rule, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept it
closed. In philanthropic schemes for the benefit of society at large
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took a cheerful part; no private sorrow touched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): no force or
mass of suffering concentrated in one heart had power to pierce hers.
Not the agony in Gethsemane, not the death on Calvary, could have wrung
from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes one tear.

<p/>I say again, Madame was a very great and a very capable woman. That
school offered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) powers too limited a sphere; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to
have swayed a nation: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should have been the leader of a turbulent
legislative assembly. Nobody could have browbeaten her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), none irritated
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nerves, exhausted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) patience, or over-reached her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) astuteness. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own single person, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could have comprised the duties of a first
minister and a superintendent of police. Wise, firm, faithless; secret,
crafty, passionless; watchful and inscrutable; acute and
insensate--withal perfectly decorous--what more could be desired?

<p/>The sensible reader will not suppose that I gained all the knowledge
here condensed for his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) benefit in one month, or in one half-year. No!
what I saw at first was the thriving outside of a large and flourishing
educational establishment. Here was a great house, full of healthy,
lively girls, all well-dressed and many of them handsome, gaining
knowledge by a marvellously easy method, without painful exertion or
useless waste of spirits; not, perhaps, making very rapid progress in
anything; taking it easy, but still always employed, and never
oppressed. Here was a corps of teachers and masters, more stringently
tasked, as all the real head-labour was to be done by them, in order to
save the pupils, yet having their duties so arranged that they relieved
each other in quick succession whenever the work was severe: here, in
short, was a foreign school; of which the life, movement, and variety
made it a complete and most charming contrast to many English
institutions of the same kind.

<p/>Behind the house was a large garden, and, in summer, the pupils almost
lived out of doors amongst the rose-bushes and the fruit-trees. Under
the vast and vine-draped berceau, Madame would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) seat on summer
afternoons, and send for the classes, in turns, to sit round her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) and
sew and read. Meantime, masters came and went, delivering short and
lively lectures, rather than lessons, and the pupils made notes of
their instructions, or did _not_ make them--just as inclination
prompted; secure that, in case of neglect, they could copy the notes of
their companions. Besides the regular monthly _jours de sortie_, the
Catholic fête-days brought a succession of holidays all the year round;
and sometimes on a bright summer morning, or soft summer evening; the
boarders were taken out for a long walk into the country, regaled with
_gaufres_ and _vin blanc_, or new milk and _pain bis_, or _pistolets au
beurre_ -LRB-rolls-RRB- and coffee. All this seemed very pleasant, and Madame
appeared goodness itself; and the teachers not so bad but they might be
worse; and the pupils, perhaps, a little noisy and rough, but types of
health and glee.

<p/>Thus did the view appear, seen through the enchantment of distance; but
there came a time when distance was to melt for me--when I was to be
called down from my watch-tower of the nursery, whence I had hitherto
made my observations, and was to be compelled into closer intercourse
with this little world of the Rue Fossette.

<p/>I was one day sitting up-stairs, as usual, hearing the children their
English lessons, and at the same time turning a silk dress for Madame,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came sauntering into the room with that absorbed air and brow
of hard thought she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sometimes wore, and which made her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) look so little
genial. Dropping into a seat opposite mine, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) remained some minutes
silent. Désirée, the eldest girl, was reading to me some little essay
of Mrs. Barbauld's, and I was making her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) translate currently from
English to French as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) proceeded, by way of ascertaining that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
comprehended what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) read: Madame listened.

<p/>Presently, without preface or prelude, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, almost in the tone of
one making an accusation, <div class="bookquote">``Meess, in England you were a governess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I smiling, <div class="bookquote">``you are mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this your first essay at teaching--this attempt with my children?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I assured her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) it was. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) became silent; but looking up, as I
took a pin from the cushion, I found myself an object of study: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
held me under her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eye; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seemed turning me round in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
thoughts--measuring my fitness for a purpose, weighing my value in a
plan. Madame had, ere this, scrutinized all I had, and I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
esteemed herself cognizant of much that I was; but from that day, for
the space of about a fortnight, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tried me by new tests. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) listened
at the nursery door when I was shut in with the children; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) followed
me at a cautious distance when I walked out with them, stealing within
ear-shot whenever the trees of park or boulevard afforded a sufficient
screen: a strict preliminary process having thus been observed, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
made a move forward.

<p/>One morning, coming on me abruptly, and with the semblance of hurry,
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) found herself placed in a little dilemma. Mr. Wilson, the
English master, had failed to come at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) was ill;
the pupils were waiting in classe; there was no one to give a lesson;
should I, for once, object to giving a short dictation exercise, just
that the pupils might not have it to say they had missed their English
lesson?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In classe, Madame?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in classe: in the second division.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where there are sixty pupils,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; for I knew the number, and with
my usual base habit of cowardice, I shrank into my sloth like a snail
into its shell, and alleged incapacity and impracticability as a
pretext to escape action. If left to myself, I should infallibly have
let this chance slip. Inadventurous, unstirred by impulses of practical
ambition, I was capable of sitting twenty years teaching infants the
hornbook, turning silk dresses and making children's frocks. Not that
true contentment dignified this infatuated resignation: my work had
neither charm for my taste, nor hold on my interest; but it seemed to
me a great thing to be without heavy anxiety, and relieved from
intimate trial: the negation of severe suffering was the nearest
approach to happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two
lives--the life of thought, and that of reality; and, provided the
former was nourished with a sufficiency of the strange necromantic joys
of fancy, the privileges of the latter might remain limited to daily
bread, hourly work, and a roof of shelter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame, as I stooped more busily than ever over the
cutting-out of a child's pinafore, <div class="bookquote">``leave that work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Fifine wants it, Madame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifine must want it, then, for I want _you_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Beck/Beck</b></font>)</div><p/>And as Madame Beck did really want and was resolved to have me--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)
had long been dissatisfied with the English master, with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
shortcomings in punctuality, and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) careless method of tuition--as,
too, _she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)_ did not lack resolution and practical activity, whether _I_
lacked them or not--she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), without more ado, made me relinquish thimble
and needle; my hand was taken into hers, and I was conducted
down-stairs. When we reached the carré, a large square hall between the
dwelling-house and the pensionnat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) paused, dropped my hand, faced,
and scrutinized me. I was flushed, and tremulous from head to foot:
tell it not in Gath, I believe I was crying. In fact, the difficulties
before me were far from being wholly imaginary; some of them were real
enough; and not the least substantial lay in my want of mastery over
the medium through which I should be obliged to teach. I had, indeed,
studied French closely since my arrival in Villette; learning its
practice by day, and its theory in every leisure moment at night, to as
late an hour as the rule of the house would allow candle-light; but I
was far from yet being able to trust my powers of correct oral
expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dîtes donc,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame sternly, <div class="bookquote">``vous sentez vous réellement trop
faible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>I might have said <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and gone back to nursery obscurity, and there,
perhaps, mouldered for the rest of my life; but looking up at Madame, I
saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) countenance a something that made me think twice ere I
decided. At that instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) did not wear a woman's aspect, but rather
a man's. Power of a particular kind strongly limned itself in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)
traits, and that power was not my kind of power: neither sympathy, nor
congeniality, nor submission, were the emotions it awakened. I
stood--not soothed, nor won, nor overwhelmed. It seemed as if a
challenge of strength between opposing gifts was given, and I suddenly
felt all the dishonour of my diffidence--all the pusillanimity of my
slackness to aspire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``go backward or forward?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>indicating with her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)
hand, first, the small door of communication with the dwelling-house,
and then the great double portals of the classes or schoolrooms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``En avant,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>pursued she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), cooling as I warmed, and continuing the hard look,
from very antipathy to which I drew strength and determination, <div class="bookquote">``can
you face the classes, or are you over-excited?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) sneered slightly in saying this: nervous excitability was not much
to Madame's taste.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am no more excited than this stone,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, tapping the flag with
my toe: <div class="bookquote">``or than you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added, returning her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bon! But let me tell you these are not quiet, decorous, English girls
you are going to encounter. Ce sont des Labassecouriennes, rondes,
franches, brusques, et tant soit peu rebelles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said: <div class="bookquote">``I know; and I know, too, that though I have studied French
hard since I came here, yet I still speak it with far too much
hesitation--too little accuracy to be able to command their respect I
shall make blunders that will lay me open to the scorn of the most
ignorant. Still I mean to give the lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They always throw over timid teachers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that too, Madame; I have heard how they rebelled against and
persecuted Miss Turner'' (<font color='red'><b>a teacher</b></font>)</div>--a poor friendless English teacher, whom Madame
had employed, and lightly discarded; and to whose piteous history I was
no stranger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'est vrai,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Turner had no more command over
them than a servant from the kitchen would have had. She (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>) was weak and
wavering; she (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>) had neither tact nor intelligence, decision nor dignity.
Miss Turner would not do for these girls at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I made no reply, but advanced to the closed schoolroom door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not expect aid from me, or from any one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame. <div class="bookquote">``That
would at once set you down as incompetent for your office.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I opened the door, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) pass with courtesy, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>). There
were three schoolrooms, all large. That dedicated to the second
division, where I was to figure, was considerably the largest, and
accommodated an assemblage more numerous, more turbulent, and
infinitely more unmanageable than the other two. In after days, when I
knew the ground better, I used to think sometimes -LRB-if such a comparison
may be permitted-RRB-, that the quiet, polished, tame first division was to
the robust, riotous, demonstrative second division, what the English
House of Lords is to the House of Commons.

<p/>The first glance informed me that many of the pupils were more than
girls--quite young women; I knew that some of them were of noble family
-LRB-as nobility goes in Labassecour-RRB-, and I was well convinced that not
one amongst them was ignorant of my position in Madame's household. As
I mounted the estràde -LRB-a low platform, raised a step above the
flooring-RRB-, where stood the teacher's chair and desk, I beheld opposite
to me a row of eyes and brows that threatened stormy weather--eyes full
of an insolent light, and brows hard and unblushing as marble. The
continental <div class="bookquote">``female''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>is quite a different being to the insular <div class="bookquote">``female''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>of the same age and class: I never saw such eyes and brows in England.
Madame Beck introduced me in one cool phrase, sailed from the room, and
left me alone in my glory.

<p/>I shall never forget that first lesson, nor all the under-current of
life and character it opened up to me. Then first did I begin rightly
to see the wide difference that lies between the novelist's and poet's
ideal <div class="bookquote">``jeune fille''  (<font color='red'><b>poet</b></font>)</div>and the said <div class="bookquote">``jeune fille''  (<font color='red'><b>poet</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) really is.

<p/>It seems that three titled belles in the first row had sat down
predetermined that a _bonne d'enfants_ should not give them lessons in
English. They knew they had succeeded in expelling obnoxious teachers
before now; they knew that Madame would at any time throw overboard a
professeur or maitresse who became unpopular with the school--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)
never assisted a weak official to retain his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) place--that if he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) had not
strength to fight, or tact to win his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) way, down he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) went: looking at
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>they promised themselves an easy victory.

<p/>Mesdemoiselles Blanche, Virginie, and Angélique opened the campaign by
a series of titterings and whisperings; these soon swelled into murmurs
and short laughs, which the remoter benches caught up and echoed more
loudly. This growing revolt of sixty against one, soon became
oppressive enough; my command of French being so limited, and exercised
under such cruel constraint.

<p/>Could I but have spoken in my own tongue, I felt as if I might have
gained a hearing; for, in the first place, though I knew I looked a
poor creature, and in many respects actually was so, yet nature had
given me a voice that could make itself heard, if lifted in excitement
or deepened by emotion. In the second place, while I had no flow, only
a hesitating trickle of language, in ordinary circumstances, yet--under
stimulus such as was now rife through the mutinous mass--I could, in
English, have rolled out readily phrases stigmatizing their proceedings
as such proceedings deserved to be stigmatized; and then with some
sarcasm, flavoured with contemptuous bitterness for the ringleaders,
and relieved with easy banter for the weaker but less knavish
followers, it seemed to me that one might possibly get command over
this wild herd, and bring them into training, at least. All I could now
do was to walk up to Blanche--Mademoiselle de Melcy, a young
baronne--the eldest, tallest, handsomest, and most vicious--stand
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) desk, take from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) exercise-book, remount
the estrade, deliberately read the composition, which I found very
stupid, and, as deliberately, and in the face of the whole school, tear
the blotted page in two.

<p/>This action availed to draw attention and check noise. One girl alone,
quite in the background, persevered in the riot with undiminished
energy. I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attentively. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a pale face, hair like
night, broad strong eyebrows, decided features, and a dark, mutinous,
sinister eye: I noted that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat close by a little door, which door,
I was well aware, opened into a small closet where books were kept. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was standing up for the purpose of conducting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clamour with freer
energies. I measured her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stature and calculated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strength. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed
both tall and wiry; but, so the conflict were brief and the attack
unexpected, I thought I might manage her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>Advancing up the room, looking as cool and careless as I possibly
could, in short, _ayant l'air de rien_, I slightly pushed the door and
found it was ajar. In an instant, and with sharpness, I had turned on
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). In another instant she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) occupied the closet, the door was shut, and
the key in my pocket.

<p/>It so happened that this girl, Dolores by name, and a Catalonian by
race, was the sort of character at once dreaded and hated by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolores</b></font>)
associates; the act of summary justice above noted proved popular:
there was not one present but, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolores</b></font>) heart, liked to see it done. They
were stilled for a moment; then a smile--not a laugh--passed from desk
to desk: then--when I had gravely and tranquilly returned to the
estrade, courteously requested silence, and commenced a dictation as if
nothing at all had happened--the pens travelled peacefully over the
pages, and the remainder of the lesson passed in order and industry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'est bien,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Beck/Beck</b></font>)</div>said Madame Beck, when I came out of class, hot and a
little exhausted. <div class="bookquote">``Ca ira.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolores</b></font>) had been listening and peeping through a spy-hole the whole time.

<p/>From that day I ceased to be nursery governess, and became English
teacher. Madame raised my salary; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolores</b></font>) got thrice the work out of me
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolores</b></font>) had extracted from Mr. Wilson, at half the expense.




<p/>CHAPTER IX.

<p/>ISIDORE.


<p/>My time was now well and profitably filled up. What with teaching
others and studying closely myself, I had hardly a spare moment. It was
pleasant. I felt I was getting, on; not lying the stagnant prey of
mould and rust, but polishing my faculties and whetting them to a keen
edge with constant use. Experience of a certain kind lay before me, on
no narrow scale. Villette is a cosmopolitan city, and in this school
were girls of almost every European nation, and likewise of very varied
rank in life. Equality is much practised in Labassecour; though not
republican in form, it is nearly so in substance, and at the desks of
Madame Beck's establishment the young countess and the young bourgeoise
sat side by side. Nor could you always by outward indications decide
which was noble and which plebeian; except that, indeed, the latter had
often franker and more courteous manners, while the former bore away
the bell for a delicately-balanced combination of insolence and deceit.
In the former there was often quick French blood mixed with the
marsh-phlegm: I regret to say that the effect of this vivacious fluid
chiefly appeared in the oilier glibness with which flattery and fiction
ran from the tongue, and in a manner lighter and livelier, but quite
heartless and insincere.

<p/>To do all parties justice, the honest aboriginal Labassecouriennes had
an hypocrisy of their own, too; but it was of a coarse order, such as
could deceive few. Whenever a lie was necessary for their occasions,
they brought it out with a careless ease and breadth altogether
untroubled by the rebuke of conscience. Not a soul in Madame Beck's
house, from the scullion to the directress herself, but was above being
ashamed of a lie; they thought nothing of it: to invent might not be
precisely a virtue, but it was the most venial of faults. <div class="bookquote">``J'ai menti
plusieurs fois,''  (<font color='red'><b>every girl confession</b></font>)</div>formed an item of every girl's and woman's monthly
confession: the priest heard unshocked, and absolved unreluctant. If
they had missed going to mass, or read a chapter of a novel, that was
another thing: these were crimes whereof rebuke and penance were the
unfailing weed.

<p/>While yet but half-conscious of this state of things, and unlearned in
its results, I got on in my new sphere very well. After the first few
difficult lessons, given amidst peril and on the edge of a moral
volcano that rumbled under my feet and sent sparks and hot fumes into
my eyes, the eruptive spirit seemed to subside, as far as I was
concerned. My mind was a good deal bent on success: I could not bear
the thought of being baffled by mere undisciplined disaffection and
wanton indocility, in this first attempt to get on in life. Many hours
of the night I used to lie awake, thinking what plan I had best adopt
to get a reliable hold on these mutineers, to bring this stiff-necked
tribe under permanent influence. In, the first place, I saw plainly
that aid in no shape was to be expected from Madame: her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) righteous plan
was to maintain an unbroken popularity with the pupils, at any and
every cost of justice or comfort to the teachers. For a teacher to seek
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) alliance in any crisis of insubordination was equivalent to
securing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own expulsion. In intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pupils, Madame only
took to herself what was pleasant, amiable, and recommendatory; rigidly
requiring of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lieutenants sufficiency for every annoying crisis,
where to act with adequate promptitude was to be unpopular. Thus, I
must look only to myself.

<p/>Imprimis--it was clear as the day that this swinish multitude were not
to be driven by force. They were to be humoured, borne with very
patiently: a courteous though sedate manner impressed them; a very rare
flash of raillery did good. Severe or continuous mental application
they could not, or would not, bear: heavy demand on the memory, the
reason, the attention, they rejected point-blank. Where an English girl
of not more than average capacity and docility would quietly take a
theme and bind herself to the task of comprehension and mastery, a
Labassecourienne would laugh in your face, and throw it back to you
with the phrase,--<div class="bookquote">``Dieu, que c'est difficile! Je n'en veux pas. Cela
m`ennuie trop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an girl</b></font>)</div><p/>A teacher who understood her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) business would take it back at once,
without hesitation, contest, or expostulation--proceed with even
exaggerated care to smoothe every difficulty, to reduce it to the level
of their understandings, return it to them thus modified, and lay on
the lash of sarcasm with unsparing hand. They would feel the sting,
perhaps wince a little under it; but they bore no malice against this
sort of attack, provided the sneer was not _sour_, but _hearty_, and
that it held well up to them, in a clear, light, and bold type, so that
she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) who ran might read, their incapacity, ignorance, and sloth. They
would riot for three additional lines to a lesson; but I never knew
them rebel against a wound given to their self-respect: the little they
had of that quality was trained to be crushed, and it rather liked the
pressure of a firm heel than otherwise.

<p/>By degrees, as I acquired fluency and freedom in their language, and
could make such application of its more nervous idioms as suited their
case, the elder and more intelligent girls began rather to like me in
their way: I noticed that whenever a pupil had been roused to feel in
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) soul the stirring of worthy emulation, or the quickening of honest
shame, from that date she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was won. If I could but once make their
-LRB-usually large-RRB- ears burn under their thick glossy hair, all was
comparatively well. By-and-by bouquets began to be laid on my desk in
the morning; by way of acknowledgment for this little foreign
attention, I used sometimes to walk with a select few during
recreation. In the course of conversation it befel once or twice that I
made an unpremeditated attempt to rectify some of their singularly
distorted notions of principle; especially I expressed my ideas of the
evil and baseness of a lie. In an unguarded moment, I chanced to say
that, of the two errors; I considered falsehood worse than an
occasional lapse in church-attendance. The poor girls were tutored to
report in Catholic ears whatever the Protestant teacher said. An
edifying consequence ensued. Something--an unseen, an indefinite, a
nameless--something stole between myself and these my best pupils: the
bouquets continued to be offered, but conversation thenceforth became
impracticable. As I paced the alleys or sat in the berceau, a girl
never came to my right hand but a teacher, as if by magic, appeared at
my left. Also, wonderful to relate, Madame's shoes of silence brought
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) continually to my back, as quick, as noiseless and unexpected, as
some wandering zephyr.

<p/>The opinion of my Catholic acquaintance concerning my spiritual
prospects was somewhat naïvely expressed to me on one occasion. A
pensionnaire, to whom I had rendered some little service, exclaimed one
day as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat beside me: <div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle, what a pity you are a
Protestant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Isabelle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Parceque, quand vous serez morte--vous brûlerez tout de suite dans
l'Enfer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Croyez-vous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainement que j'y crois: tout le monde le sait; et d'ailleurs le
prêtre me l'a dit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabelle</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabelle was an odd, blunt little creature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabelle</b></font>) added, _sotto voce_:
<div class="bookquote">``Pour assurer votre salut là-haut, on ferait bien de vous brûler toute
vive ici-bas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>I laughed, as, indeed, it was impossible to do otherwise.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>Has the reader forgotten Miss Ginevra Fanshawe? If so, I must be
allowed to re-introduce that young lady as a thriving pupil of Madame
Beck's; for such she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was. On her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arrival in the Rue Fossette, two or
three days after my sudden settlement there, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) encountered me with
very little surprise. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have had good blood in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) veins, for
never was any duchess more perfectly, radically, unaffectedly
_nonchalante_ than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): a weak, transient amaze was all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew of the
sensation of wonder. Most of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) other faculties seemed to be in the
same flimsy condition: her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) liking and disliking, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) love and hate,
were mere cobweb and gossamer; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had one thing about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that
seemed strong and durable enough, and that was--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) selfishness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not proud; and--_bonne d'enfants_ as I was--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would forthwith
have made of me a sort of friend and confidant. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) teased me with a
thousand vapid complaints about school-quarrels and household economy:
the cookery was not to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) taste; the people about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), teachers and
pupils, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held to be despicable, because they were foreigners. I bore
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) abuse of the Friday's salt fish and hard eggs--with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
invective against the soup, the bread, the coffee--with some patience
for a time; but at last, wearied by iteration, I turned crusty, and put
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to rights: a thing I ought to have done in the very beginning, for
a salutary setting down always agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>Much longer had I to endure her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) demands on me in the way of work. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
wardrobe, so far as concerned articles of external wear, was well and
elegantly supplied; but there were other habiliments not so carefully
provided: what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had, needed frequent repair. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hated
needle-drudgery herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hose, &c. to me in
heaps, to be mended. A compliance of some weeks threatening to result
in the establishment of an intolerable bore--I at last distinctly told
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must make up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind to mend her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own garments. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried on
receiving this information, and accused me of having ceased to be her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
friend; but I held by my decision, and let the hysterics pass as they
could.

<p/>Notwithstanding these foibles, and various others needless to
mention--but by no means of a refined or elevating character--how
pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was! How charming she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came down on a sunny
Sunday morning, well-dressed and well-humoured, robed in pale lilac
silk, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fair long curls reposing on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) white shoulders.
Sunday was a holiday which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) always passed with friends resident in
town; and amongst these friends she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) speedily gave me to understand was
one who would fain become something more. By glimpses and hints it was
shown me, and by the general buoyancy of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) look and manner it was ere
long proved, that ardent admiration--perhaps genuine love--was at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
command. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) suitor <div class="bookquote">``Isidore:''  (<font color='red'><b>suitor</b></font>)</div>this, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intimated
was not his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) real name, but one by which it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to baptize
him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hinted, not being <div class="bookquote">``very pretty.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Once, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
been bragging about the vehemence of <div class="bookquote">``Isidore's''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>attachment, I asked if
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Comme cela,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) is handsome, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) loves me to
distraction, so that I am well amused. Ca suffit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carried the thing on longer than, from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very fickle
tastes, I had anticipated, I one day took it upon me to make serious
inquiries as to whether the gentleman was such as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) parents, and
especially her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) uncle--on whom, it appeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was dependent--would be
likely to approve. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) allowed that this was very doubtful, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did
not believe <div class="bookquote">``Isidore''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>had much money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Furieusement sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Without being certain that you will be permitted to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how dowdyish you are! I don't want to be married. I am too young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) loves you as much as you say, and yet it comes to nothing in
the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) will be made miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) will break his (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) heart. I should be shocked and,
disappointed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether this M. Isidore is a fool?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is, about me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is wise in other things, à ce qu'on dit. Mrs.
Cholmondeley considers him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) extremely clever: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will push his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
way by his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) talents; all I know is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) does little more than sigh
in my presence, and that I can wind him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) round my little finger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>Wishing to get a more definite idea of this love-stricken M. Isidore;
whose position seemed to me of the least secure, I requested her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to
favour me with a personal description; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not describe: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had neither words nor the power of putting them together so as to make
graphic phrases. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) even seemed not properly to have noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>):
nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looks, of the changes in his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) countenance, had touched
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart or dwelt in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) memory--that he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``beau, mais plutôt bel
homme que joli garçon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could assert. My patience would
often have failed, and my interest flagged, in listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but
for one thing. All the hints she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dropped, all the details she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave,
went unconsciously to prove, to my thinking, that M. Isidore's homage
was offered with great delicacy and respect. I informed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very
plainly that I believed him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) much too good for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and intimated with
equal plainness my impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was but a vain coquette. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
laughed, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) curls from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, and danced away as if I had
paid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a compliment.

<p/>Miss Ginevra's school-studies were little better than nominal; there
were but three things she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) practised in earnest, viz. music, singing,
and dancing; also embroidering the fine cambric handkerchiefs which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
could not afford to buy ready worked: such mere trifles as lessons in
history, geography, grammar, and arithmetic, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left undone, or got
others to do for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Very much of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) time was spent in visiting.
Madame, aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stay at school was now limited to a certain
period, which would not be extended whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made progress or not,
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) great licence in this particular. Mrs. Cholmondeley--her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>)
_chaperon_--a gay, fashionable lady, invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) had
company at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) own house, and sometimes took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) to evening-parties at
the houses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) acquaintance. Ginevra perfectly approved this mode of
procedure: it had but one inconvenience; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) was obliged to be well
dressed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) had not money to buy variety of dresses. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>)
thoughts turned on this difficulty; her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) whole soul was occupied with
expedients for effecting its solution. It was wonderful to witness the
activity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) otherwise indolent mind on this point, and to see the
much-daring intrepidity to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) was spurred by a sense of
necessity, and the wish to shine.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) begged boldly of Mrs. Cholmondeley--boldly, I say: not with an air
of reluctant shame, but in this strain:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling Mrs. C., I have nothing in the world fit to wear for your
party next week; you _must_ give me a book-muslin dress, and then a
_ceinture bleu celeste_: _do_--there's an angel! will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The <div class="bookquote">``darling Mrs. C.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>yielded at first; but finding that applications
increased as they were complied with, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) was soon obliged, like all
Miss Fanshawe's friends, to oppose resistance to encroachment. After a
while I heard no more of Mrs. Cholmondeley's presents; but still,
visiting went on, and the absolutely necessary dresses continued to be
supplied: also many little expensive _etcetera_--gloves, bouquets, even
trinkets. These things, contrary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) custom, and even nature--for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) was not secretive--were most sedulously kept out of sight for a
time; but one evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) was going to a large party for which
particular care and elegance of costume were demanded, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) could not
resist coming to my chamber to show herself in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) splendour.

<p/>Beautiful she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) looked: so young, so fresh, and with a delicacy of skin
and flexibility of shape altogether English, and not found in the list
of continental female charms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) dress was new, costly, and perfect. I
saw at a glance that it lacked none of those finishing details which
cost so much, and give to the general effect such an air of tasteful
completeness.

<p/>I viewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) from top to toe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) turned airily round that I might
survey her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) on all sides. Conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) charms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) best
humour: her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) rather small blue eyes sparkled gleefully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) was going to
bestow on me a kiss, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) school-girl fashion of showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) delights
but I said, <div class="bookquote">``Steady! Let us be Steady, and know what we are about, and
find out the meaning of our magnificence'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--and so put her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) off at arm's
length, to undergo cooler inspection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``There are different ways of doing; and, by my word, I
don't understand yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how do I look?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look well dressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) thought the praise not warm enough, and proceeded to direct
attention to the various decorative points of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) attire. <div class="bookquote">``Look at this
_parure_,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The brooch, the ear-rings, the bracelets: no one
in the school has such a set--not Madame herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see them all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Pause.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Did M. de Bassompierre give you those
jewels?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle knows nothing about them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were they presents from Mrs. Cholmondeley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not they, indeed. Mrs. Cholmondeley is a mean, stingy creature; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>)
never gives me anything now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I did not choose to ask any further questions, but turned abruptly away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, old Crusty--old Diogenes''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>-LRB-these were her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) familiar terms for me
when we disagreed-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``what is the matter now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take yourself away. I have no pleasure in looking at you or your
_parure_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) seemed taken by surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What now, Mother Wisdom? I have not got into debt for it--that is, not
for the jewels, nor the gloves, nor the bouquet. My dress is certainly
not paid for, but uncle de Bassompierre will pay it in the bill: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)
never notices items, but just looks at the total; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) is so rich,
one need not care about a few guineas more or less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you go? I want to shut the door... Ginevra, people may tell you
you are very handsome in that ball-attire; but, in _my_ eyes, you will
never look so pretty as you did in the gingham gown and plain straw
bonnet you wore when I first saw you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Other people have not your puritanical tastes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) angry reply.
<div class="bookquote">``And, besides, I see no right you have to sermonize me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly! I have little right; and you, perhaps, have still less to
come flourishing and fluttering into my chamber--a mere jay in borrowed
plumes. I have not the least respect for your feathers, Miss Fanshawe;
and especially the peacock's eyes you call a _parure_: very pretty
things, if you had bought them with money which was your own, and which
you could well spare, but not at all pretty under present
circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On est là pour Mademoiselle Fanshawe!''  (<font color='red'><b>the portress</b></font>)</div>was announced by the portress,
and away she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) tripped.

<p/>This semi-mystery of the _parure_ was not solved till two or three days
afterwards, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) came to make a voluntary confession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not be sulky with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``in the idea that I am
running somebody, papa or M. de Bassompierre, deeply into debt. I
assure you nothing remains unpaid for, but the few dresses I have
lately had: all the rest is settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought, <div class="bookquote">``lies the mystery; considering that they were not
given you by Mrs. Cholmondeley, and that your own means are limited to
a few shillings, of which I know you to be excessively careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ecoutez!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) went on, drawing near and speaking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) most
confidential and coaxing tone; for my <div class="bookquote">``sulkiness''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was inconvenient to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) liked me to be in a talking and listening mood, even if I only
talked to chide and listened to rail. <div class="bookquote">``Ecoutez, chère grogneuse! I will
tell you all how and about it; and you will then see, not only how
right the whole thing is, but how cleverly managed. In the first place,
I _must_ go out. Papa himself said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) wished me to see something
of the world; he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) particularly remarked to Mrs. Cholmondeley, that,
though I was a sweet creature enough, I had rather a
bread-and-butter-eating, school-girl air; of which it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) special
desire that I should get rid, by an introduction to society here,
before I make my regular début in England. Well, then, if I go out, I
_must_ dress. Mrs. Cholmondeley is turned shabby, and will give nothing
more; it would be too hard upon uncle to make him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pay for _all_ the
things I need: _that_ you can't deny--_that_ agrees with your own
preachments. Well, but SOMEBODY who heard me -LRB-quite by chance, I assure
you-RRB- complaining to Mrs. Cholmondeley of my distressed circumstances,
and what straits I was put to for an ornament or two--_somebody_, far
from grudging one a present, was quite delighted at the idea of being
permitted to offer some trifle. You should have seen what a _blanc-bec_
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) looked when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) first spoke of it: how he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hesitated and blushed, and
positively trembled from fear of a repulse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do, Miss Fanshawe. I suppose I am to understand that M.
Isidore is the benefactor: that it is from him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) you have accepted that
costly _parure_; that he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) supplies your bouquets and your gloves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You express yourself so disagreeably,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``one hardly knows how
to answer; what I mean to say is, that I occasionally allow Isidore the
pleasure and honour of expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) homage by the offer of a trifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It comes to the same thing... Now, Ginevra, to speak the plain truth,
I don't very well understand these matters; but I believe you are doing
very wrong--seriously wrong. Perhaps, however, you now feel certain
that you will be able to marry M. Isidore; your parents and uncle have
given their consent, and, for your part, you love him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) entirely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais pas du tout!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) always had recourse to French when about to
say something specially heartless and perverse-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Je suis sa reine,
mais il n'est pas mon roi.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, I must believe this language is mere nonsense and coquetry.
There is nothing great about you, yet you are above profiting by the
good nature and purse of a man to whom you feel absolute indifference.
You love M. Isidore far more than you think, or will avow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I danced with a young officer the other night, whom I love a
thousand times more than he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). I often wonder why I feel so very cold to
Isidore, for everybody says he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) is handsome, and other ladies admire
him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>); but, somehow, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) bores me: let me see now how it is...''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) seemed to make an effort to reflect. In this I encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``try to get a clear idea of the state of your mind. To
me it seems in a great mess--chaotic as a rag-bag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is something in this fashion,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) cried out ere long: <div class="bookquote">``the man is
too romantic and devoted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expects something more of me than I
find it convenient to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks I am perfect: furnished with all
sorts of sterling qualities and solid virtues, such as I never had, nor
intend to have. Now, one can't help, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presence, rather trying to
justify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good opinion; and it does so tire one to be goody, and to
talk sense,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really thinks I am sensible. I am far more at my
ease with you, old lady--you, you dear crosspatch--who take me at my
lowest, and know me to be coquettish, and ignorant, and flirting, and
fickle, and silly, and selfish, and all the other sweet things you and
I have agreed to be a part of my character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, making a strenuous effort to preserve
that gravity and severity which ran risk of being shaken by this
whimsical candour, <div class="bookquote">``but it does not alter that wretched business of the
presents. Pack them up, Ginevra, like a good, honest girl, and send
them back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>), stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are deceiving M. Isidore. It stands to reason that by
accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) presents you give him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to understand he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) will one day
receive an equivalent, in your regard...''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) interrupted: <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) equivalent now, in the
pleasure of seeing me wear them--quite enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is only
bourgeois.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This phrase, in its senseless arrogance, quite cured me of the
temporary weakness which had made me relax my tone and aspect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>)
rattled on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My present business is to enjoy youth, and not to think of fettering
myself, by promise or vow, to this man or that. When first I saw
Isidore, I believed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would help me to enjoy it I believed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be
content with my being a pretty girl; and that we should meet and part
and flutter about like two butterflies, and be happy. Lo, and behold! I
find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at times as grave as a judge, and deep-feeling and thoughtful.
Bah! Les penseurs, les hommes profonds et passionnés ne sont pas à mon
goût. Le Colonel Alfred de Hamal suits me far better. Va pour les beaux
fats et les jolis fripons! Vive les joies et les plaisirs! A bas les
grandes passions et les sévères vertus!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) looked for an answer to this tirade. I gave none.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``J'aime mon beau Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``je n'aimerai jamais son rival.
Je ne serai jamais femme de bourgeois, moi!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I now signified that it was imperatively necessary my apartment should
be relieved of the honour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) presence: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) went away laughing.




<p/>CHAPTER X.

<p/>DR JOHN.


<p/>Madame Beck was a most consistent character; forbearing with all the
world, and tender to no part of it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) own children drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) into no
deviation from the even tenor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) stoic calm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) was solicitous
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) family, vigilant for their interests and physical well-being;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) never seemed to know the wish to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) little children upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) lap, to press their rosy lips with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) own, to gather them in a
genial embrace, to shower on them softly the benignant caress, the
loving word.

<p/>I have watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) sometimes sitting in the garden, viewing the little
bees afar off, as they walked in a distant alley with Trinette, their
_bonne_; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) mien spoke care and prudence. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) often pondered
anxiously what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``leur avenir;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but if the youngest, a puny
and delicate but engaging child, chancing to spy her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>), broke from its
nurse, and toddling down the walk, came all eager and laughing and
panting to clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) knee, Madame would just calmly put out one hand,
so as to prevent inconvenient concussion from the child's sudden onset:
<div class="bookquote">``Prends garde, mon enfant!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would say unmoved, patiently permit it
to stand near her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) a few moments, and then, without smile or kiss, or
endearing syllable, rise and lead it back to Trinette.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) demeanour to the eldest girl was equally characteristic in another
way. This was a vicious child. <div class="bookquote">``Quelle peste que cette Désirée! Quel
poison que cet enfant là!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>were the expressions dedicated to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), alike
in kitchen and in schoolroom. Amongst her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) other endowments she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) boasted
an exquisite skill in the art, of provocation, sometimes driving her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
_bonne_ and the servants almost wild. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would steal to their attics,
open their drawers and boxes, wantonly tear their best caps and soil
their best shawls; she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would watch her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) opportunity to get at the buffet
of the salle-à-manger, where she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would smash articles of porcelain or
glass--or to the cupboard of the storeroom, where she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would plunder the
preserves, drink the sweet wine, break jars and bottles, and so
contrive as to throw the onus of suspicion on the cook and the
kitchen-maid. All this when Madame saw, and of which when she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) received
report, her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sole observation, uttered with matchless serenity, was:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Désirée a besoin d'une surveillance toute particulière.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Accordingly
she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) kept this promising olive-branch a good deal at her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) side. Never
once, I believe, did she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) faithfully of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) faults, explain the
evil of such habits, and show the results which must thence ensue.
Surveillance must work the whole cure. It failed of course. Désirée was
kept in some measure from the servants, but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) teased and pillaged her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
mamma instead. Whatever belonging to Madame's work-table or toilet she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
could lay her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hands on, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) stole and hid. Madame saw all this, but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
still pretended not to see: she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had not rectitude of soul to confront
the child with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) vices. When an article disappeared whose value
rendered restitution necessary, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would profess to think that Désirée
had taken it away in play, and beg her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) to restore it. Désirée was not
to be so cheated: she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had learned to bring falsehood to the aid of
theft, and would deny having touched the brooch, ring, or scissors.
Carrying on the hollow system, the mother would calmly assume an air of
belief, and afterwards ceaselessly watch and dog the child till she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
tracked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>): to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hiding-places--some hole in the garden-wall--some
chink or cranny in garret or out-house. This done, Madame would send
Désirée out for a walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) _bonne_, and profit by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) absence to
rob the robber. Désirée proved herself the true daughter of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) astute
parent, by never suffering either her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) countenance or manner to betray
the least sign of mortification on discovering the loss.

<p/>The second child, Fifine, was said to be like its dead father.
Certainly, though the mother had given it her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) healthy frame, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blue
eye and ruddy cheek, not from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was derived its moral being. It was
an honest, gleeful little soul: a passionate, warm-tempered, bustling
creature it was too, and of the sort likely to blunder often into
perils and difficulties. One day it bethought itself to fall from top
to bottom of a steep flight of stone steps; and when Madame, hearing
the noise -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always heard every noise-RRB-, issued from the
salle-à-manger and picked it up, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said quietly,--<div class="bookquote">``Cet enfant a un os
cassé.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At first we hoped this was not the case. It was, however, but too true:
one little plump arm hung powerless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Meess''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>-LRB-meaning me-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``take her (<font color='blue'><b>rival</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Madame; <div class="bookquote">``et qu'on aille tout
de suite chercher un fiacre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>In a _fiacre_ she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) promptly, but with admirable coolness and
self-possession, departed to fetch a surgeon.

<p/>It appeared she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not find the family-surgeon at home; but that
mattered not: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sought until she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand on a substitute to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
mind, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) back with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Meantime I had cut the child's
sleeve from its arm, undressed and put it to bed.

<p/>We none of us, I suppose -LRB-by _we_ I mean the bonne, the cook, the
portress, and myself, all which personages were now gathered in the
small and heated chamber-RRB-, looked very scrutinizingly at the new doctor
when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) came into the room. I, at least, was taken up with endeavouring
to soothe Fifine; whose cries -LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had good lungs-RRB- were appalling
to hear. These cries redoubled in intensity as the stranger approached
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bed; when he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up, <div class="bookquote">``Let alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried passionately, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) broken English -LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke English as did the other children-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``I will not you: I will Dr. Pillule!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Dr. Pillule is my very good friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer, in perfect
English; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is busy at a place three leagues off, and I am come in
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stead. So now, when we get a little calmer, we must commence
business; and we will soon have that unlucky little arm bandaged and in
right order.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Hereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) called for a glass of _eau sucrée_, fed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with some
teaspoonfuls of the sweet liquid -LRB-Fifine was a frank gourmande; anybody
could win her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) palate-RRB-, promised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) more when the
operation should be over, and promptly went to work. Some assistance
being needed, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) demanded it of the cook, a robust, strong-armed woman;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), the portress, and the nurse instantly fled. I did not like to
touch that small, tortured limb, but thinking there was no alternative,
my hand was already extended to do what was requisite. I was
anticipated; Madame Beck had put out her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) own hand: hers was steady
while mine trembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ca vaudra mieux,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, turning from me to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) showed wisdom in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) choice. Mine would have been feigned stoicism,
forced fortitude. Hers was neither forced nor feigned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merci, Madame; très bien, fort bien!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the operator when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had
finished. <div class="bookquote">``Voilà un sang-froid bien opportun, et qui vaut mille élans
de sensibilité déplacée.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) firmness, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) compliment. It was
likely, too, that his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) whole general appearance, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) voice, mien, and
manner, wrought impressions in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) favour. Indeed, when you looked well
at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and when a lamp was brought in--for it was evening and now
waxing dusk--you saw that, unless Madame Beck had been less than woman,
it could not well be otherwise. This young doctor -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) _was_ young-RRB- had
no common aspect. His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stature looked imposingly tall in that little
chamber, and amidst that group of Dutch-made women; his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) profile was
clear, fine and expressive: perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eye glanced from face to face
rather too vividly, too quickly, and too often; but it had a most
pleasant character, and so had his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mouth; his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) chin was full, cleft,
Grecian, and perfect. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) smile, one could not in a hurry make up
one's mind as to the descriptive epithet it merited; there was
something in it that pleased, but something too that brought surging up
into the mind all one's foibles and weak points: all that could lay one
open to a laugh. Yet Fifine liked this doubtful smile, and thought the
owner genial: much as he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hand to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
a friendly good-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) patted the little hand kindly, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
and Madame went down-stairs together; she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) talking in her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) highest tide
of spirits and volubility, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) listening with an air of good-natured
amenity, dashed with that unconscious roguish archness I find it
difficult to describe.

<p/>I noticed that though he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) spoke French well, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) spoke English better; he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
had, too, an English complexion, eyes, and form. I noticed more. As he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
passed me in leaving the room, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) face in my direction one
moment--not to address me, but to speak to Madame, yet so standing,
that I almost necessarily looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)--a recollection which had
been struggling to form in my memory, since the first moment I heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) voice, started up perfected. This was the very gentleman to whom I
had spoken at the bureau; who had helped me in the matter of the trunk;
who had been my guide through the dark, wet park. Listening, as he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
passed down the long vestibule out into the street, I recognised his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
very tread: it was the same firm and equal stride I had followed under
the dripping trees.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>It was, to be concluded that this young surgeon-physician's first visit
to the Rue Fossette would be the last. The respectable Dr. Pillule
being expected home the next day, there appeared no reason why his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
temporary substitute should again represent him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>); but the Fates had
written their decree to the contrary.

<p/>Dr. Pillule had been summoned to see a rich old hypochondriac at the
antique university town of Bouquin-Moisi, and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) prescribing
change of air and travel as remedies, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was retained to accompany the
timid patient on a tour of some weeks; it but remained, therefore, for
the new doctor to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) attendance at the Rue Fossette.

<p/>I often saw him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) came; for Madame would not trust the little
invalid to Trinette, but required me to spend much of my time in the
nursery. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was skilful. Fifine recovered rapidly under his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
care, yet even her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) convalescence did not hasten his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) dismissal. Destiny
and Madame Beck seemed in league, and both had ruled that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should
make deliberate acquaintance with the vestibule, the private staircase
and upper chambers of the Rue Fossette.

<p/>No sooner did Fifine emerge from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands than Désirée declared
herself ill. That possessed child had a genius for simulation, and
captivated by the attentions and indulgences of a sick-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) came
to the conclusion that an illness would perfectly accommodate her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
tastes, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) bed accordingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) acted well, and her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) mother
still better; for while the whole case was transparent to Madame Beck
as the day, she (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) treated it with an astonishingly well-assured air of
gravity and good faith.

<p/>What surprised me was, that Dr. John -LRB-so the young Englishman had
taught Fifine to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), and we all took from her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) the habit of
addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) by this name, till it became an established custom, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was known by no other in the Rue Fossette-RRB---that Dr. John consented
tacitly to adopt Madame's tactics, and to fall in with her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) manoeuvres.
He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) betrayed, indeed, a period of comic doubt, cast one or two rapid
glances from the child to the mother, indulged in an interval of
self-consultation, but finally resigned himself with a good grace to
play his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) part in the farce. Désirée eat like a raven, gambolled day and
night in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bed, pitched tents with the sheets and blankets, lounged
like a Turk amidst pillows and bolsters, diverted herself with throwing
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoes at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bonne and grimacing at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sisters--over-flowed, in
short, with unmerited health and evil spirits; only languishing when
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mamma and the physician paid their diurnal visit. Madame Beck, I
knew, was glad, at any price, to have her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter in bed out of the
way of mischief; but I wondered that Dr. John did not tire of the
business.

<p/>Every day, on this mere pretext of a motive, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gave punctual
attendance; Madame always received him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with the same empressement, the
same sunshine for himself, the same admirably counterfeited air of
concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child. Dr. John wrote harmless prescriptions for the
patient, and viewed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother with a shrewdly sparkling eye. Madame
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) rallying looks without resenting them--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had too much good
sense for that. Supple as the young doctor seemed, one could not
despise him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)--this pliant part was evidently not adopted in the design
to curry favour with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) employer: while he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) office at the
pensionnat, and lingered strangely about the Rue Fossette, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>) was
independent, almost careless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>) carriage there; and yet, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>)
was often thoughtful and preoccupied.

<p/>It was not perhaps my business to observe the mystery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>) bearing,
or search out its origin or aim; but, placed as I was, I could hardly
help it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>) laid himself open to my observation, according to my
presence in the room just that degree of notice and consequence a
person of my exterior habitually expects: that is to say, about what is
given to unobtrusive articles of furniture, chairs of ordinary joiner's
work, and carpets of no striking pattern. Often, while waiting for
Madame, he (<font color='blue'><b>joiner</b></font>) would muse, smile, watch, or listen like a man who thinks
himself alone. I, meantime, was free to puzzle over his (<font color='blue'><b>joiner</b></font>) countenance and
movements, and wonder what could be the meaning of that peculiar
interest and attachment--all mixed up with doubt and strangeness, and
inexplicably ruled by some presiding spell--which wedded him (<font color='blue'><b>joiner</b></font>) to this
demi-convent, secluded in the built-up core of a capital. He (<font color='blue'><b>joiner</b></font>), I
believe, never remembered that I had eyes in my head, much less a brain
behind them.

<p/>Nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>joiner</b></font>) ever have found this out, but that one day, while he (<font color='blue'><b>joiner</b></font>) sat
in the sunshine and I was observing the colouring of his (<font color='blue'><b>joiner</b></font>) hair,
whiskers, and complexion--the whole being of such a tone as a strong
light brings out with somewhat perilous force -LRB-indeed I recollect I was
driven to compare his (<font color='blue'><b>joiner</b></font>) beamy head in my thoughts to that of the <div class="bookquote">``golden
image''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up-RRB-, an idea new, sudden,
and startling, riveted my attention with an over-mastering strength and
power of attraction. I know not to this day how I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>): the
force of surprise, and also of conviction, made me forget myself; and I
only recovered wonted consciousness when I saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) notice was
arrested, and that it had caught my movement in a clear little oval
mirror fixed in the side of the window recess--by the aid of which
reflector Madame often secretly spied persons walking in the garden
below. Though of so gay and sanguine a temperament, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was not without
a certain nervous sensitiveness which made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ill at ease under a
direct, inquiring gaze. On surprising me thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) turned and said, in a
tone which, though courteous, had just so much dryness in it as to mark
a shade of annoyance, as well as to give to what was said the character
of rebuke, <div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle does not spare me: I am not vain enough to
fancy that it is my merits which attract her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) attention; it must then be
some defect. Dare I ask--what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the character Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>I was confounded, as the reader may suppose, yet not with an
irrecoverable confusion; being conscious that it was from no emotion of
incautious admiration, nor yet in a spirit of unjustifiable
inquisitiveness, that I had incurred this reproof. I might have cleared
myself on the spot, but would not. I did not speak. I was not in the
habit of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>). Suffering him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), then, to think what he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) chose
and accuse me of what he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would, I resumed some work I had dropped, and
kept my head bent over it during the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) stay. There is a
perverse mood of the mind which is rather soothed than irritated by
misconstruction; and in quarters where we can never be rightly known,
we take pleasure, I think, in being consummately ignored. What honest
man, on being casually taken for a housebreaker, does not feel rather
tickled than vexed at the mistake?




<p/>CHAPTER XI.

<p/>THE PORTRESS``S CABINET.


<p/>It was summer and very hot. Georgette, the youngest of Madame Beck's
children, took a fever. Désirée, suddenly cured of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) ailments, was,
together with Fifine, packed off to Bonne-Maman, in the country, by way
of precaution against infection. Medical aid was now really needed, and
Madame, choosing to ignore the return of Dr. Pillule, who had been at
home a week, conjured his (<font color='blue'><b>Désirée</b></font>) English rival to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Désirée</b></font>) visits. One or
two of the pensionnaires complained of headache, and in other respects
seemed slightly to participate in Georgette's ailment. <div class="bookquote">``Now, at last,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought, <div class="bookquote">``Dr. Pillule must be recalled: the prudent directress will
never venture to permit the attendance of so young a man on the pupils.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The directress was very prudent, but she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could also be intrepidly
venturous. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actually introduced Dr. John to the school-division of
the premises, and established him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in attendance on the proud and
handsome Blanche de Melcy, and the vain, flirting Angélique, her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
friend. Dr. John, I thought, testified a certain gratification at this
mark of confidence; and if discretion of bearing could have justified
the step, it would by him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) have been amply justified. Here, however, in
this land of convents and confessionals, such a presence as his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not
to be suffered with impunity in a <div class="bookquote">``pensionnat de demoiselles.''  (<font color='red'><b>parents</b></font>)</div>The
school gossiped, the kitchen whispered, the town caught the rumour,
parents wrote letters and paid visits of remonstrance. Madame, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
been weak, would now have been lost: a dozen rival educational houses
were ready to improve this false step--if false step it were--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
ruin; but Madame was not weak, and little Jesuit though she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) might be,
yet I clapped the hands of my heart, and with its voice cried <div class="bookquote">``brava!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) able bearing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) skilled management, her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) temper and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) firmness on this occasion.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) met the alarmed parents with a good-humoured, easy grace for nobody
matched her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) in, I know not whether to say the possession or the
assumption of a certain <div class="bookquote">``rondeur et franchise de bonne femme;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which on
various occasions gained the point aimed at with instant and complete
success, where severe gravity and serious reasoning would probably have
failed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ce pauvre Docteur Jean!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) would say, chuckling and rubbing joyously
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) fat little white hands; <div class="bookquote">``ce cher jeune homme! le meilleur créature
du monde!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and go on to explain how she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) happened to be employing him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) own children, who were so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) they would scream
themselves into fits at the thought of another doctor; how, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
had confidence for her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) thought it natural to repose trust for
others, and au reste, it was only the most temporary expedient in the
world; Blanche and Angélique had the migraine; Dr. John had written a
prescription; voilà tout!

<p/>The parents' mouths were closed. Blanche and Angélique saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) all
remaining trouble by chanting loud duets in their physician's praise;
the other pupils echoed them, unanimously declaring that when they were
ill they would have Dr. John and nobody else; and Madame laughed, and
the parents laughed too. The Labassecouriens must have a large organ of
philoprogenitiveness: at least the indulgence of offspring is carried
by them to excessive lengths; the law of most households being the
children's will. Madame now got credit for having acted on this
occasion in a spirit of motherly partiality: she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) came off with flying
colours; people liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) as a directress better than ever.

<p/>To this day I never fully understood why she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) thus risked her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) interest
for the sake of Dr. John. What people said, of course I know well: the
whole house--pupils, teachers, servants included--affirmed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) was
going to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). So they had settled it; difference of age seemed to
make no obstacle in their eyes: it was to be so.

<p/>It must be admitted that appearances did not wholly discountenance this
idea; Madame seemed so bent on retaining his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) services, so oblivious of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) former protégé, Pillule. She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) made, too, such a point of personally
receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) visits, and was so unfailingly cheerful, blithe, and
benignant in her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) manner to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) paid, about this time,
marked attention to dress: the morning dishabille, the nightcap and
shawl, were discarded; Dr. John's early visits always found her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) with
auburn braids all nicely arranged, silk dress trimly fitted on, neat
laced brodequins in lieu of slippers: in short the whole toilette
complete as a model, and fresh as a flower. I scarcely think, however,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) intention in this went further than just to show a very
handsome man that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) was not quite a plain woman; and plain she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) was
not. Without beauty of feature or elegance of form, she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) pleased.
Without youth and its gay graces, she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) cheered. One never tired of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) was never monotonous, or insipid, or colourless, or
flat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) unfaded hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) eye with its temperate blue light, her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
cheek with its wholesome fruit-like bloom--these things pleased in
moderation, but with constancy.

<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>), indeed, floating visions of adopting Dr. John as a husband,
taking him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) well-furnished home, endowing him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) savings,
which were said to amount to a moderate competency, and making him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
comfortable for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) life? Did Dr. John suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) of such
visions? I have met him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) coming out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) presence with a mischievous
half-smile about his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lips, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes a look as of masculine
vanity elate and tickled. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) good looks and good-nature, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
was not perfect; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) must have been very imperfect if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) roguishly
encouraged aims he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) never intended to be successful. But did he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) not
intend them to be successful? People said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had no money, that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was
wholly dependent upon his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) profession. Madame--though perhaps some
fourteen years his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) senior--was yet the sort of woman never to grow old,
never to wither, never to break down. They certainly were on good
terms. _He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_ perhaps was not in love; but how many people ever _do_
love, or at least marry for love, in this world. We waited the end.

<p/>For what _he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_ waited, I do not know, nor for what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) watched; but the
peculiarity of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) manner, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) expectant, vigilant, absorbed, eager
look, never wore off: it rather intensified. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had never been quite
within the compass of my penetration, and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ranged farther and
farther beyond it.

<p/>One morning little Georgette had been more feverish and consequently
more peevish; she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) was crying, and would not be pacified. I thought a
particular draught ordered, disagreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>), and I doubted whether
it ought to be continued; I waited impatiently for the doctor's coming
in order to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).

<p/>The door-bell rang, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was admitted; I felt sure of this, for I heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) voice addressing the portress. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) custom to mount straight
to the nursery, taking about three degrees of the staircase at once,
and coming upon us like a cheerful surprise. Five minutes
elapsed--ten--and I saw and heard nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). What could he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) be
doing? Possibly waiting in the corridor below. Little Georgette still
piped her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) plaintive wail, appealing to me by her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) familiar term,
<div class="bookquote">``Minnie, Minnie, me very poorly!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>till my heart ached. I descended to
ascertain why he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not come. The corridor was empty. Whither was he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
vanished? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) with Madame in the _salle-à-manger?_ Impossible: I had
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) but a short time since, dressing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) own chamber. I
listened. Three pupils were just then hard at work practising in three
proximate rooms--the dining-room and the greater and lesser
drawing-rooms, between which and the corridor there was but the
portress's cabinet communicating with the salons, and intended
originally for a boudoir. Farther off, at a fourth instrument in the
oratory, a whole class of a dozen or more were taking a singing lesson,
and just then joining in a <div class="bookquote">``barcarole''  (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I think they called it-RRB-,
whereof I yet remember these words <div class="bookquote">``fraîchë,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``brisë,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Venisë.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Under these circumstances, what could I hear? A great deal, certainly;
had it only been to the purpose.

<p/>Yes; I heard a giddy treble laugh in the above-mentioned little
cabinet, close by the door of which I stood--that door half-unclosed; a
man's voice in a soft, deep, pleading tone, uttered some, words,
whereof I only caught the adjuration, <div class="bookquote">``For God's sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then, after a
second's pause, forth issued Dr. John, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eye full shining, but not
with either joy or triumph; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fair English cheek high-coloured; a
baffled, tortured, anxious, and yet a tender meaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brow.

<p/>The open door served me as a screen; but had I been full in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way, I
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have passed without seeing me. Some mortification,
some strong vexation had hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) soul: or rather, to write my
impressions now as I received them at the time I should say some
sorrow, some sense of injustice. I did not so much think his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pride was
hurt, as that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) affections had been wounded--cruelly wounded, it
seemed to me. But who was the torturer? What being in that house had
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) so much in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) power? Madame I believed to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chamber; the
room whence he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had stepped was dedicated to the portress's sole use;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), Rosine Matou, an unprincipled though pretty little French
grisette, airy, fickle, dressy, vain, and mercenary--it was not,
surely, to _her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ hand he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) owed the ordeal through which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed to
have passed?

<p/>But while I pondered, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice, clear, though somewhat sharp, broke
out in a lightsome French song, trilling through the door still ajar: I
glanced in, doubting my senses. There at the table she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat in a smart
dress of <div class="bookquote">``jaconas rose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>trimming a tiny blond cap: not a living thing
save herself was in the room, except indeed some gold fish in a glass
globe, some flowers in pots, and a broad July sunbeam.

<p/>Here was a problem: but I must go up-stairs to ask about the medicine.

<p/>Dr. John sat in a chair at Georgette's bedside; Madame stood before
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); the little patient had been examined and soothed, and now lay
composed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) crib. Madame Beck, as I entered, was discussing the
physician's own health, remarking on some real or fancied change in his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>)
looks, charging him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) with over-work, and recommending rest and change of
air. He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) listened good-naturedly, but with laughing indifference,
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``trop bonne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and that he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) felt perfectly well.
Madame appealed to me--Dr. John following her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) movement with a slow
glance which seemed to express languid surprise at reference being made
to a quarter so insignificant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think, Miss Lucie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>asked Madame. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) not paler and
thinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very seldom that I uttered more than monosyllables in Dr. John's
presence; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was the kind of person with whom I was likely ever to
remain the neutral, passive thing he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thought me. Now, however, I took
licence to answer in a phrase: and a phrase I purposely made quite
significant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looks ill at this moment; but perhaps it is owing to some temporary
cause: Dr. John may have been vexed or harassed.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot tell how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
took this speech, as I never sought his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face for information. Georgette
here began to ask me in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) broken English if she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) might have a glass of
_eau sucrée_. I answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) in English. For the first time, I fancy,
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) noticed that I spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) language; hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had always taken me
for a foreigner, addressing me as <div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and giving in French
the requisite directions about the children's treatment. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed on
the point of making a remark; but thinking better of it, held his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
tongue.

<p/>Madame recommenced advising him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head, laughing, rose and
bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) good-morning, with courtesy, but still with the regardless air
of one whom too much unsolicited attention was surfeiting and spoiling.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was gone, Madame dropped into the chair he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had just left; she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>)
rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) chin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) hand; all that was animated and amiable vanished
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) face: she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) looked stony and stern, almost mortified and morose.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) sighed; a single, but a deep sigh. A loud bell rang for
morning-school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) got up; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) passed a dressing-table with a glass
upon it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) reflected image. One single white hair
streaked her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) nut-brown tresses; she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) plucked it out with a shudder. In
the full summer daylight, her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) face, though it still had the colour,
could plainly be seen to have lost the texture of youth; and then,
where were youth's contours? Ah, Madame! wise as you were, even _you_
knew weakness. Never had I pitied Madame before, but my heart softened
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) turned darkly from the glass. A calamity had come
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>). That hag Disappointment was greeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) with a grisly
<div class="bookquote">``All-hail,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) soul rejected the intimacy.

<p/>But Rosine! My bewilderment there surpasses description. I embraced
five opportunities of passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) cabinet that day, with a view to
contemplating her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) charms, and finding out the secret of their
influence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) was pretty, young, and wore a well-made dress. All very
good points, and, I suppose, amply sufficient to account, in any
philosophic mind, for any amount of agony and distraction in a young
man, like Dr. John. Still, I could not help forming half a wish that
the said doctor were my brother; or at least that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had a sister or a
mother who would kindly sermonize him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). I say _half_ a wish; I broke it,
and flung it away before it became a whole one, discovering in good
time its exquisite folly. <div class="bookquote">``Somebody,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I argued, <div class="bookquote">``might as well
sermonize Madame about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) young physician: and what good would that
do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I believe Madame sermonized herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not behave weakly, or make
herself in any shape ridiculous. It is true she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had neither strong
feelings to overcome, nor tender feelings by which to be miserably
pained. It is true likewise that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had an important avocation, a real
business to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) time, divert her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thoughts, and divide her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
interest. It is especially true that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) possessed a genuine good sense
which is not given to all women nor to all men; and by dint of these
combined advantages she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) behaved wisely--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) behaved well. Brava! once
more, Madame Beck. I saw you matched against an Apollyon of a
predilection; you fought a good fight, and you overcame!




<p/>CHAPTER XII.

<p/>THE CASKET.


<p/>Behind the house at the Rue Fossette there was a garden--large,
considering that it lay in the heart of a city, and to my recollection
at this day it seems pleasant: but time, like distance, lends to
certain scenes an influence so softening; and where all is stone
around, blank wall and hot pavement, how precious seems one shrub, how
lovely an enclosed and planted spot of ground!

<p/>There went a tradition that Madame Beck's house had in old days been a
convent. That in years gone by--how long gone by I cannot tell, but I
think some centuries--before the city had over-spread this quarter, and
when it was tilled ground and avenue, and such deep and leafy seclusion
as ought to embosom a religious house--that something had happened on
this site which, rousing fear and inflicting horror, had left to the
place the inheritance of a ghost-story. A vague tale went of a black
and white nun, sometimes, on some night or nights of the year, seen in
some part of this vicinage. The ghost must have been built out some
ages ago, for there were houses all round now; but certain
convent-relics, in the shape of old and huge fruit-trees, yet
consecrated the spot; and, at the foot of one--a Methuselah of a
pear-tree, dead, all but a few boughs which still faithfully renewed
their perfumed snow in spring, and their honey-sweet pendants in
autumn--you saw, in scraping away the mossy earth between the
half-bared roots, a glimpse of slab, smooth, hard, and black. The
legend went, unconfirmed and unaccredited, but still propagated, that
this was the portal of a vault, imprisoning deep beneath that ground,
on whose surface grass grew and flowers bloomed, the bones of a girl
whom a monkish conclave of the drear middle ages had here buried alive
for some sin against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) vow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shadow it was that tremblers had
feared, through long generations after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) poor frame was dust; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
black robe and white veil that, for timid eyes, moonlight and shade had
mocked, as they fluctuated in the night-wind through the garden-thicket.

<p/>Independently of romantic rubbish, however, that old garden had its
charms. On summer mornings I used to rise early, to enjoy them alone;
on summer evenings, to linger solitary, to keep tryste with the rising
moon, or taste one kiss of the evening breeze, or fancy rather than
feel the freshness of dew descending. The turf was verdant, the
gravelled walks were white; sun-bright nasturtiums clustered beautiful
about the roots of the doddered orchard giants. There was a large
berceau, above which spread the shade of an acacia; there was a
smaller, more sequestered bower, nestled in the vines which ran all
along a high and grey wall, and gathered their tendrils in a knot of
beauty, and hung their clusters in loving profusion about the favoured
spot where jasmine and ivy met and married them.

<p/>Doubtless at high noon, in the broad, vulgar middle of the day, when
Madame Beck's large school turned out rampant, and externes and
pensionnaires were spread abroad, vying with the denizens of the boys'
college close at hand, in the brazen exercise of their lungs and
limbs--doubtless _then_ the garden was a trite, trodden-down place
enough. But at sunset or the hour of _salut_, when the externes were
gone home, and the boarders quiet at their studies; pleasant was it
then to stray down the peaceful alleys, and hear the bells of St. Jean
Baptiste peal out with their sweet, soft, exalted sound.

<p/>I was walking thus one evening, and had been detained farther within
the verge of twilight than usual, by the still-deepening calm, the
mellow coolness, the fragrant breathing with which flowers no sunshine
could win now answered the persuasion of the dew. I saw by a light in
the oratory window that the Catholic household were then gathered to
evening prayer--a rite, from attendance on which, I now and then, as a
Protestant, exempted myself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One moment longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered solitude and the summer moon, <div class="bookquote">``stay with
us: all is truly quiet now; for another quarter of an hour your
presence will not be missed: the day's heat and bustle have tired you;
enjoy these precious minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The windowless backs of houses built in this garden, and in particular
the whole of one side, was skirted by the rear of a long line of
premises--being the boarding-houses of the neighbouring college. This
rear, however, was all blank stone, with the exception of certain attic
loopholes high up, opening from the sleeping-rooms of the
women-servants, and also one casement in a lower story said to mark the
chamber or study of a master. But, though thus secure, an alley, which
ran parallel with the very high wall on that side the garden, was
forbidden to be entered by the pupils. It was called indeed <div class="bookquote">``l'allée
défendue,''  (<font color='red'><b>any girl</b></font>)</div>and any girl setting foot there would have rendered herself
liable to as severe a penalty as the mild rules of Madame Beck's
establishment permitted. Teachers might indeed go there with impunity;
but as the walk was narrow, and the neglected shrubs were grown very
thick and close on each side, weaving overhead a roof of branch and
leaf which the sun's rays penetrated but in rare chequers, this alley
was seldom entered even during day, and after dusk was carefully
shunned.

<p/>From the first I was tempted to make an exception to this rule of
avoidance: the seclusion, the very gloom of the walk attracted me. For
a long time the fear of seeming singular scared me away; but by
degrees, as people became accustomed to me and my habits, and to such
shades of peculiarity as were engrained in my nature--shades, certainly
not striking enough to interest, and perhaps not prominent enough to
offend, but born in and with me, and no more to be parted with than my
identity--by slow degrees I became a frequenter of this strait and
narrow path. I made myself gardener of some tintless flowers that grew
between its closely-ranked shrubs; I cleared away the relics of past
autumns, choking up a rustic seat at the far end. Borrowing of Goton,
the cuisinière, a pail of water and a scrubbing-brush, I made this seat
clean. Madame saw me at work and smiled approbation: whether sincerely
or not I don't know; but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) _seemed_ sincere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Voyez-vous,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``comme elle est propre, cette demoiselle
Lucie? Vous aimez done cette allée, Meess?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``it is quiet
and shady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``C'est juste,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with an air of bonté; and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) kindly
recommended me to confine myself to it as much as I chose, saying, that
as I was not charged with the surveillance, I need not trouble myself
to walk with the pupils: only I might permit her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) children to come
there, to talk English with me.

<p/>On the night in question, I was sitting on the hidden seat reclaimed
from fungi and mould, listening to what seemed the far-off sounds of
the city. Far off, in truth, they were not: this school was in the
city's centre; hence, it was but five minutes' walk to the park, scarce
ten to buildings of palatial splendour. Quite near were wide streets
brightly lit, teeming at this moment with life: carriages were rolling
through them to balls or to the opera. The same hour which tolled
curfew for our convent, which extinguished each lamp, and dropped the
curtain round each couch, rang for the gay city about us the summons to
festal enjoyment. Of this contrast I thought not, however: gay
instincts my nature had few; ball or opera I had never seen; and though
often I had heard them described, and even wished to see them, it was
not the wish of one who hopes to partake a pleasure if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could only
reach it--who feels fitted to shine in some bright distant sphere,
could she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) but thither win her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) way; it was no yearning to attain, no
hunger to taste; only the calm desire to look on a new thing.

<p/>A moon was in the sky, not a full moon, but a young crescent. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
through a space in the boughs overhead. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and the stars, visible
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), were no strangers where all else was strange: my childhood
knew them. I had seen that golden sign with the dark globe in its curve
leaning back on azure, beside an old thorn at the top of an old field,
in Old England, in long past days, just as it now leaned back beside a
stately spire in this continental capital.

<p/>Oh, my childhood! I had feelings: passive as I lived, little as I
spoke, cold as I looked, when I thought of past days, I _could_ feel.
About the present, it was better to be stoical; about the future--such
a future as mine--to be dead. And in catalepsy and a dead trance, I
studiously held the quick of my nature.

<p/>At that time, I well remember whatever could excite--certain accidents
of the weather, for instance, were almost dreaded by me, because they
woke the being I was always lulling, and stirred up a craving cry I
could not satisfy. One night a thunder-storm broke; a sort of hurricane
shook us in our beds: the Catholics rose in panic and prayed to their
saints. As for me, the tempest took hold of me with tyranny: I was
roughly roused and obliged to live. I got up and dressed myself, and
creeping outside the casement close by my bed, sat on its ledge, with
my feet on the roof of a lower adjoining building. It was wet, it was
wild, it was pitch-dark. Within the dormitory they gathered round the
night-lamp in consternation, praying loud. I could not go in: too
resistless was the delight of staying with the wild hour, black and
full of thunder, pealing out such an ode as language never delivered to
man--too terribly glorious, the spectacle of clouds, split and pierced
by white and blinding bolts.

<p/>I did long, achingly, then and for four and twenty hours afterwards,
for something to fetch me out of my present existence, and lead me
upwards and onwards. This longing, and all of a similar kind, it was
necessary to knock on the head; which I did, figuratively, after the
manner of Jael to Sisera, driving a nail through their temples. Unlike
Sisera, they did not die: they were but transiently stunned, and at
intervals would turn on the nail with a rebellious wrench: then did the
temples bleed, and the brain thrill to its core.

<p/>To-night, I was not so mutinous, nor so miserable. My Sisera lay quiet
in the tent, slumbering; and if his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) pain ached through his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) slumbers,
something like an angel--the ideal--knelt near, dropping balm on the
soothed temples, holding before the sealed eyes a magic glass, of which
the sweet, solemn visions were repeated in dreams, and shedding a
reflex from her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) moonlight wings and robe over the transfixed sleeper,
over the tent threshold, over all the landscape lying without. Jael,
the stern woman; sat apart, relenting somewhat over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) captive; but
more prone to dwell on the faithful expectation of Heber coming home.
By which words I mean that the cool peace and dewy sweetness of the
night filled me with a mood of hope: not hope on any definite point,
but a general sense of encouragement and heart-ease.

<p/>Should not such a mood, so sweet, so tranquil, so unwonted, have been
the harbinger of good? Alas, no good came of it! I Presently the rude
Real burst coarsely in--all evil grovelling and repellent as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) too
often is.

<p/>Amid the intense stillness of that pile of stone overlooking the walk,
the trees, the high wall, I heard a sound; a casement -LSB-all the windows
here are casements, opening on hinges-RSB- creaked. Ere I had time to look
up and mark where, in which story, or by whom unclosed, a tree overhead
shook, as if struck by a missile; some object dropped prone at my feet.

<p/>Nine was striking by St. Jean Baptiste's clock; day was fading, but it
was not dark: the crescent moon aided little, but the deep gilding of
that point in heaven where the sun beamed last, and the crystalline
clearness of a wide space above, sustained the summer twilight; even in
my dark walk I could, by approaching an opening, have managed to read
print of a small type. Easy was it to see then that the missile was a
box, a small box of white and coloured ivory; its loose lid opened in
my hand; violets lay within, violets smothering a closely folded bit of
pink paper, a note, superscribed, <div class="bookquote">``Pour la robe grise.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wore indeed a
dress of French grey.

<p/>Good. Was this a billet-doux? A thing I had heard of, but hitherto had
not had the honour of seeing or handling. Was it this sort of commodity
I held between my finger and thumb at this moment?

<p/>Scarcely: I did not dream it for a moment. Suitor or admirer my very
thoughts had not conceived. All the teachers had dreams of some lover;
one -LRB-but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was naturally of a credulous turn-RRB- believed in a future
husband. All the pupils above fourteen knew of some prospective
bridegroom; two or three were already affianced by their parents, and
had been so from childhood: but into the realm of feelings and hopes
which such prospects open, my speculations, far less my presumptions,
had never once had warrant to intrude. If the other teachers went into
town, or took a walk on the boulevards, or only attended mass, they
were very certain -LRB-according to the accounts brought back-RRB- to meet with
some individual of the <div class="bookquote">``opposite sex,''  (<font color='red'><b>some individual</b></font>)</div>whose rapt, earnest gaze assured
them of their power to strike and to attract. I can't say that my
experience tallied with theirs, in this respect. I went to church and I
took walks, and am very well convinced that nobody minded me. There was
not a girl or woman in the Rue Fossette who could not, and did not
testify to having received an admiring beam from our young doctor's
blue eyes at one time or other. I am obliged, however humbling it may
sound, to except myself: as far as I was concerned, those blue eyes
were guiltless, and calm as the sky, to whose tint theirs seemed akin.
So it came to pass that I heard the others talk, wondered often at
their gaiety, security, and self-satisfaction, but did not trouble
myself to look up and gaze along the path they seemed so certain of
treading. This then was no billet-doux; and it was in settled
conviction to the contrary that I quietly opened it. Thus it ran--I
translate:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel of my dreams! A thousand, thousand thanks for the promise kept:
scarcely did I venture to hope its fulfilment. I believed you, indeed,
to be half in jest; and then you seemed to think the enterprise beset

secluded--often, you said, haunted by that dragon, the English

feared to behold vacancy, or the dragon aforesaid! How my heart
palpitated with delight when, through apertures in the envious boughs,
I at once caught the gleam of your graceful straw-hat, and the waving
of your grey dress--dress that I should recognise amongst a thousand.
But why, my angel, will you not look up? Cruel, to deny me one ray of
those adorable eyes!--how a single glance would have revived me! I
write this in fiery haste; while the physician examines Gustave, I
snatch an opportunity to enclose it in a small casket, together with a
bouquet of flowers, the sweetest that blow--yet less sweet than thee,
my Peri--my all-charming! ever thine-thou well knowest whom!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I did know whom,''  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>was my comment; and the wish bore even closer
reference to the person addressed in this choice document, than to the
writer thereof. Perhaps it was from the fiancé of one of the engaged
pupils; and, in that case, there was no great harm done or
intended--only a small irregularity. Several of the girls, the
majority, indeed, had brothers or cousins at the neighbouring college.
But <div class="bookquote">``la robe grise, le chapeau de paille,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>here surely was a clue--a
very confusing one. The straw-hat was an ordinary garden head-screen,
common to a score besides myself. The grey dress hardly gave more
definite indication. Madame Beck herself ordinarily wore a grey dress
just now; another teacher, and three of the pensionnaires, had had grey
dresses purchased of the same shade and fabric as mine: it was a sort
of every-day wear which happened at that time to be in vogue.

<p/>Meanwhile, as I pondered, I knew I must go in. Lights, moving in the
dormitory, announced that prayers were over, and the pupils going to
bed. Another half-hour and all doors would be locked--all lights
extinguished. The front door yet stood open, to admit into the heated
house the coolness of the summer night; from the portress's cabinet
close by shone a lamp, showing the long vestibule with the two-leaved
drawing-room doors on one side, the great street-door closing the vista.

<p/>All at once, quick rang the bell--quick, but not loud--a cautious
tinkle--a sort of warning metal whisper. Rosine darted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) cabinet
and ran to open. The person she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) admitted stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) two minutes in
parley: there seemed a demur, a delay. Rosine came to the garden door,
lamp in hand; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) stood on the steps, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) lamp, looking round
vaguely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quel conte!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) cried, with a coquettish laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Personne n'y a été.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me pass,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>pleaded a voice I knew: <div class="bookquote">``I ask but five minutes;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and a
familiar shape, tall and grand -LRB-as we of the Rue Fossette all thought
it-RRB-, issued from the house, and strode down amongst the beds and walks.
It was sacrilege--the intrusion of a man into that spot, at that hour;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew himself privileged, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trusted to the friendly
night. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wandered down the alleys, looking on this side and on
that--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was lost in the shrubs, trampling flowers and breaking
branches in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) search--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) penetrated at last the <div class="bookquote">``forbidden walk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There I met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), like some ghost, I suppose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. John! it is found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not ask by whom, for with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quick eye he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceived that I held
it in my hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not betray her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, looking at me as if I were indeed a
dragon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were I ever so disposed to treachery, I cannot betray what I do not
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my answer. <div class="bookquote">``Read the note, and you will see how little it
reveals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you have read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought to myself; and yet I could not
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote it: that could hardly be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) style: besides, I was
fool enough to think there would be a degree of hardship in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) calling
me such names. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own look vindicated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew hot, and coloured
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is indeed too much: this is cruel, this is humiliating,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>were the
words that fell from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>I thought it _was_ cruel, when I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance so moved. No
matter whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to blame or not; somebody, it seemed to me, must
be more to blame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you do about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquired of me. <div class="bookquote">``Shall you tell Madame
Beck what you have found, and cause a stir--an esclandre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought I ought to tell, and said so; adding that I did not believe
there would be either stir or esclandre: Madame was much too prudent to
make a noise about an affair of that sort connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
establishment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood looking down and meditating. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was both too proud and too
honourable to entreat my secresy on a point which duty evidently
commanded me to communicate. I wished to do right, yet loathed to
grieve or injure him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Just then Rosine glanced out through the open
door; she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not see us, though between the trees I could plainly
see her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dress was grey, like mine. This circumstance, taken in
connection with prior transactions, suggested to me that perhaps the
case, however deplorable, was one in which I was under no obligation
whatever to concern myself. Accordingly, I said,--<div class="bookquote">``If you can assure me
that none of Madame Beck's pupils are implicated in this business, I
shall be very happy to stand aloof from all interference. Take the
casket, the bouquet, and the billet; for my part, I gladly forget the
whole affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispered suddenly, as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand closed on what I
offered, and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed through the boughs.

<p/>I looked. Behold Madame, in shawl, wrapping-gown, and slippers, softly
descending the steps, and stealing like a cat round the garden: in two
minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would have been upon Dr. John. If _she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ were like a cat,
however, _he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_, quite as much, resembled a leopard: nothing could be
lighter than his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tread when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chose. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) watched, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned a
corner, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took the garden at two noiseless bounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reappeared, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was gone. Rosine helped him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), instantly interposing the door between
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) huntress. I, too, might have got, away, but I preferred to
meet Madame openly.

<p/>Though it was my frequent and well-known custom to spend twilight in
the garden, yet, never till now, had I remained so late. Full sure was
I that Madame had missed--was come in search of me, and designed now to
pounce on the defaulter unawares. I expected a reprimand. No. Madame
was all goodness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) tendered not even a remonstrance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) testified
no shade of surprise. With that consummate tact of hers, in which I
believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) was never surpassed by living thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) even professed
merely to have issued forth to taste <div class="bookquote">``la brise du soir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quelle belle nuit!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), looking up at the stars--the moon was
now gone down behind the broad tower of Jean Baptiste. <div class="bookquote">``Qu'il fait bon?
que l'air est frais!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>And, instead of sending me in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) detained me to take a few turns with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) down the principal alley. When at last we both re-entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)
leaned affably on my shoulder by way of support in mounting the
front-door steps; at parting, her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) cheek was presented to my lips, and
<div class="bookquote">``Bon soir, my bonne amie; dormez bien!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) kindly adieu for the
night.

<p/>I caught myself smiling as I lay awake and thoughtful on my
couch--smiling at Madame. The unction, the suavity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) behaviour
offered, for one who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), a sure token that suspicion of some kind
was busy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) brain. From some aperture or summit of observation,
through parted bough or open window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) had doubtless caught a
glimpse, remote or near, deceptive or instructive, of that night's
transactions. Finely accomplished as she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) was in the art of
surveillance, it was next to impossible that a casket could be thrown
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) garden, or an interloper could cross her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) walks to seek it,
without that she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), in shaken branch, passing shade, unwonted footfall,
or stilly murmur -LRB-and though Dr. John had spoken very low in the few
words he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dropped me, yet the hum of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) man's voice pervaded, I
thought, the whole conventual ground-RRB---without, I say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) should
have caught intimation of things extraordinary transpiring on her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)
premises. _What_ things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) might by no means see, or at that time be
able to discover; but a delicious little ravelled plot lay tempting her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)
to disentanglement; and in the midst, folded round and round in
cobwebs, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) not secured <div class="bookquote">``Meess Lucie''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>clumsily involved, like the
foolish fly she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) was?




<p/>CHAPTER XIII.

<p/>A SNEEZE OUT OF SEASON.


<p/>I had occasion to smile--nay, to laugh, at Madame again, within the
space of four and twenty hours after the little scene treated of in the
last chapter.

<p/>Villette owns a climate as variable, though not so humid, as that of
any English town. A night of high wind followed upon that soft sunset,
and all the next day was one of dry storm--dark, beclouded, yet
rainless,--the streets were dim with sand and dust, whirled from the
boulevards. I know not that even lovely weather would have tempted me
to spend the evening-time of study and recreation where I had spent it
yesterday. My alley, and, indeed, all the walks and shrubs in the
garden, had acquired a new, but not a pleasant interest; their
seclusion was now become precarious; their calm--insecure. That
casement which rained billets, had vulgarized the once dear nook it
overlooked; and elsewhere, the eyes of the flowers had gained vision,
and the knots in the tree-boles listened like secret ears. Some plants
there were, indeed, trodden down by Dr. John in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) search, and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
hasty and heedless progress, which I wished to prop up, water, and
revive; some footmarks, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had left on the beds: but these, in
spite of the strong wind, I found a moment's leisure to efface very
early in the morning, ere common eyes had discovered them. With a
pensive sort of content, I sat down to my desk and my German, while the
pupils settled to their evening lessons; and the other teachers took up
their needlework.

<p/>The scene of the <div class="bookquote">``etude du soir''  (<font color='red'><b>the boarders</b></font>)</div>was always the refectory, a much
smaller apartment than any of the three classes or schoolrooms; for
here none, save the boarders, were ever admitted, and these numbered
only a score. Two lamps hung from the ceiling over the two tables;
these were lit at dusk, and their kindling was the signal for
school-books being set aside, a grave demeanour assumed, general
silence enforced, and then commenced <div class="bookquote">``la lecture pieuse.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This said
<div class="bookquote">``lecture pieuse''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was, I soon found, mainly designed as a wholesome
mortification of the Intellect, a useful humiliation of the Reason; and
such a dose for Common Sense as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might digest at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) leisure, and
thrive on as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) best could.

<p/>The book brought out -LRB-it was never changed, but when finished,
recommenced-RRB- was a venerable volume, old as the hills--grey as the
Hôtel de Ville.

<p/>I would have given two francs for the chance of getting that book once
into my hands, turning over the sacred yellow leaves, ascertaining the
title, and perusing with my own eyes the enormous figments which, as an
unworthy heretic, it was only permitted me to drink in with my
bewildered ears. This book contained legends of the saints. Good God!
-LRB-I speak the words reverently-RRB- what legends they were. What gasconading
rascals those saints must have been, if they first boasted these
exploits or invented these miracles. These legends, however, were no
more than monkish extravagances, over which one laughed inwardly; there
were, besides, priestly matters, and the priestcraft of the book was
far worse than its monkery. The ears burned on each side of my head as
I listened, perforce, to tales of moral martyrdom inflicted by Rome;
the dread boasts of confessors, who had wickedly abused their office,
trampling to deep degradation high-born ladies, making of countesses
and princesses the most tormented slaves under the sun. Stories like
that of Conrad and Elizabeth of Hungary, recurred again and again, with
all its dreadful viciousness, sickening tyranny and black impiety:
tales that were nightmares of oppression, privation, and agony.

<p/>I sat out this <div class="bookquote">``lecture pieuse''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>for some nights as well as I could, and
as quietly too; only once breaking off the points of my scissors by
involuntarily sticking them somewhat deep in the worm-eaten board of
the table before me. But, at last, it made me so burning hot, and my
temples, and my heart, and my wrist throbbed so fast, and my sleep
afterwards was so broken with excitement, that I could sit no longer.
Prudence recommended henceforward a swift clearance of my person from
the place, the moment that guilty old book was brought out. No Mause
Headrigg ever felt a stronger call to take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Prudence</b></font>) testimony against
Sergeant Bothwell, than I--to speak my mind in this matter of the
popish <div class="bookquote">``lecture pieuse.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>However, I did manage somehow to curb and rein
in; and though always, as soon as Rosine came to light the lamps, I
shot from the room quickly, yet also I did it quietly; seizing that
vantage moment given by the little bustle before the dead silence, and
vanishing whilst the boarders put their books away.

<p/>When I vanished--it was into darkness; candles were not allowed to be
carried about, and the teacher who forsook the refectory, had only the
unlit hall, schoolroom, or bedroom, as a refuge. In winter I sought the
long classes, and paced them fast to keep myself warm--fortunate if the
moon shone, and if there were only stars, soon reconciled to their dim
gleam, or even to the total eclipse of their absence. In summer it was
never quite dark, and then I went up-stairs to my own quarter of the
long dormitory, opened my own casement -LRB-that chamber was lit by five
casements large as great doors-RRB-, and leaning out, looked forth upon the
city beyond the garden, and listened to band-music from the park or the
palace-square, thinking meantime my own thoughts, living my own life,
in my own still, shadow-world.

<p/>This evening, fugitive as usual before the Pope and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) works, I
mounted the staircase, approached the dormitory, and quietly opened the
door, which was always kept carefully shut, and which, like every other
door in this house, revolved noiselessly on well-oiled hinges. Before I
_saw_, I _felt_ that life was in the great room, usually void: not that
there was either stir or breath, or rustle of sound, but Vacuum lacked,
Solitude was not at home. All the white beds--the <div class="bookquote">``lits d'ange,''  (<font color='red'><b>no sleeper</b></font>)</div>as
they were poetically termed--lay visible at a glance; all were empty:
no sleeper reposed therein. The sound of a drawer cautiously slid out
struck my ear; stepping a little to one side, my vision took a free
range, unimpeded by falling curtains. I now commanded my own bed and my
own toilet, with a locked work-box upon it, and locked drawers
underneath.

<p/>Very good. A dumpy, motherly little body, in decent shawl and the
cleanest of possible nightcaps, stood before this toilet, hard at work
apparently doing me the kindness of <div class="bookquote">``tidying out''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>the <div class="bookquote">``meuble.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Open
stood the lid of the work-box, open the top drawer; duly and
impartially was each succeeding drawer opened in turn: not an article
of their contents but was lifted and unfolded, not a paper but was
glanced over, not a little box but was unlidded; and beautiful was the
adroitness, exemplary the care with which the search was accomplished.
Madame wrought at it like a true star, <div class="bookquote">``unhasting yet unresting.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>I
will not deny that it was with a secret glee I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). Had I been
a gentleman I believe Madame would have found favour in my eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
was so handy, neat, thorough in all she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) did: some people's movements
provoke the soul by their loose awkwardness, hers--satisfied by their
trim compactness. I stood, in short, fascinated; but it was necessary
to make an effort to break this spell a retreat must be beaten. The
searcher might have turned and caught me; there would have been nothing
for it then but a scene, and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and I would have had to come all at
once, with a sudden clash, to a thorough knowledge of each other: down
would have gone conventionalities, away swept disguises, and _I_ should
have looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) into mine--we should have known that
we could work together no more, and parted in this life for ever.

<p/>Where was the use of tempting such a catastrophe? I was not angry, and
had no wish in the world to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). I could hardly get another
employer whose yoke would be so light and so, easy of carriage; and
truly I liked Madame for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) capital sense, whatever I might think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) principles: as to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) system, it did me no harm; she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) might work me
with it to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) heart's content: nothing would come of the operation.
Loverless and inexpectant of love, I was as safe from spies in my
heart-poverty, as the beggar from thieves in his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) destitution of purse.
I turned, then, and fled; descending the stairs with progress as swift
and soundless as that of the spider, which at the same instant ran down
the bannister.

<p/>How I laughed when I reached the schoolroom. I knew now she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had
certainly seen Dr. John in the garden; I knew what her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) thoughts were.
The spectacle of a suspicious nature so far misled by its own
inventions, tickled me much. Yet as the laugh died, a kind of wrath
smote me, and then bitterness followed: it was the rock struck, and
Meribah's waters gushing out. I never had felt so strange and
contradictory an inward tumult as I felt for an hour that evening:
soreness and laughter, and fire, and grief, shared my heart between
them. I cried hot tears: not because Madame mistrusted me--I did not
care twopence for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mistrust--but for other reasons. Complicated,
disquieting thoughts broke up the whole repose of my nature. However,
that turmoil subsided: next day I was again Lucy Snowe.

<p/>On revisiting my drawers, I found them all securely locked; the closest
subsequent examination could not discover change or apparent
disturbance in the position of one object. My few dresses were folded
as I had left them; a certain little bunch of white violets that had
once been silently presented to me by a stranger -LRB-a stranger to me, for
we had never exchanged words-RRB-, and which I had dried and kept for its
sweet perfume between the folds of my best dress, lay there unstirred;
my black silk scarf, my lace chemisette and collars, were unrumpled.
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) creased one solitary article, I own I should have felt much
greater difficulty in forgiving her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); but finding all straight and
orderly, I said, <div class="bookquote">``Let bygones be bygones. I am unharmed: why should I
bear malice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>A thing there was which puzzled myself, and I sought in my brain a key
to that riddle almost as sedulously as Madame had sought a guide to
useful knowledge in my toilet drawers. How was it that Dr. John, if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
had not been accessory to the dropping of that casket into the garden,
should have known that it _was_ dropped, and appeared so promptly on
the spot to seek it? So strong was the wish to clear up this point that
I began to entertain this daring suggestion: <div class="bookquote">``Why may I not, in case I
should ever have the opportunity, ask Dr. John himself to explain this
coincidence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And so long as Dr. John was absent, I really believed I had courage to
test him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with such a question.

<p/>Little Georgette was now convalescent; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) physician accordingly
made his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) visits very rare: indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) would have ceased them
altogether, had not Madame insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) giving an occasional call
till the child should be quite well.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) came into the nursery one evening just after I had listened to
Georgette's lisped and broken prayer, and had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) to bed. Taking
the little one's hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Cette enfant a toujours un peu de
fièvre.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And presently afterwards, looking at me with a quicker glance
than was habitual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) quiet eye, <div class="bookquote">``Le Docteur John l'a-t-il vue
dernièrement? Non, n'est-ce pas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) knew this better than any other person in the house.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I am going out, pour faire quelques courses en
fiacre. I shall call on Dr. John, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to the child. I will
that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) this evening; her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cheeks are flushed, her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pulse is
quick; _you_ will receive him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--for my part, I shall be from home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Now the child was well enough, only warm with the warmth of July; it
was scarcely less needful to send for a priest to administer extreme
unction than for a doctor to prescribe a dose; also Madame rarely made
<div class="bookquote">``courses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) called them, in the evening: moreover, this was the
first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) had chosen to absent herself on the occasion of a visit
from Dr. John. The whole arrangement indicated some plan; this I saw,
but without the least anxiety. <div class="bookquote">``Ha! ha! Madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Light-heart the Beggar</b></font>)</div>laughed Light-heart
the Beggar, <div class="bookquote">``your crafty wits are on the wrong tack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Light-heart the Beggar</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) departed, attired very smartly, in a shawl of price, and a certain
_chapeau vert tendre_--hazardous, as to its tint, for any complexion
less fresh than her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) own, but, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>), not unbecoming. I wondered what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) intended: whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) really would send Dr. John or not; or whether
indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would come: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might be engaged.

<p/>Madame had charged me not to let Georgette sleep till the doctor came;
I had therefore sufficient occupation in telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) nursery tales and
palavering the little language for her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) benefit. I affected Georgette;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) was a sensitive and a loving child: to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) in my lap, or carry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) in my arms, was to me a treat. To-night she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) would have me lay my
head on the pillow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) crib; she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) even put her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) little arms round my
neck. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) clasp, and the nestling action with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>)
cheek to mine, made me almost cry with a tender pain. Feeling of no
kind abounded in that house; this pure little drop from a pure little
source was too sweet: it penetrated deep, and subdued the heart, and
sent a gush to the eyes. Half an hour or an hour passed; Georgette
murmured in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) soft lisp that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) was growing sleepy. <div class="bookquote">``And you _shall_
sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I, <div class="bookquote">``malgré maman and médecin, if they are not here in
ten minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Hark! There was the ring, and there the tread, astonishing the
staircase by the fleetness with which it left the steps behind. Rosine
introduced Dr. John, and, with a freedom of manner not altogether
peculiar to herself, but characteristic of the domestics of Villette
generally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) stayed to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had to say. Madame's presence
would have awed her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) own realm of the vestibule and the
cabinet--for mine, or that of any other teacher or pupil, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) cared not
a jot. Smart, trim and pert, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) stood, a hand in each pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>)
gay grisette apron, eyeing Dr. John with no more fear or shyness than
if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been a picture instead of a living gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Le marmot n'a rien, nest-ce pas?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>), indicating Georgette with
a jerk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) chin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pas beaucoup,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>was the answer, as the doctor hastily scribbled with
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pencil some harmless prescription.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh bien!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosine</b></font>)</div>pursued Rosine, approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) quite near, while he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) put up
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pencil. <div class="bookquote">``And the box--did you get it? Monsieur went off like a
coup-de-vent the other night; I had not time to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I found it: yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who threw it, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosine</b></font>)</div>continued Rosine, speaking quite freely the
very words I should so much have wished to say, but had no address or
courage to bring it out: how short some people make the road to a point
which, for others, seems unattainable!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be my secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>rejoined Dr. John briefly, but with no sort
of hauteur: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed quite to understand the Rosine or grisette
character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais enfin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>), nothing abashed, <div class="bookquote">``monsieur knew it was
thrown, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) came to seek it--how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was attending a little patient in the college near,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and
saw it dropped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) chamber window, and so came to pick it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>How simple the whole explanation! The note had alluded to a physician
as then examining <div class="bookquote">``Gustave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a physician</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ça!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosine</b></font>)</div>pursued Rosine; <div class="bookquote">``il n'y a donc rien là-dessous: pas de
mystère, pas d'amourette, par exemple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pas plus que sur ma main,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>responded the doctor, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) palm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quel dommage!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>responded the grisette: <div class="bookquote">``et moi--à qui tout cela
commençait à donner des idées.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vraiment! vous en êtes pour vos frais,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>was the doctor's cool
rejoinder.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) pouted. The doctor could not help laughing at the sort of <div class="bookquote">``moue''
 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) made: when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) laughed, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had something peculiarly good-natured and
genial in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) look. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand incline to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How many times have you opened the door for me within this last
month?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur ought to have kept count of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosine</b></font>)</div>said Rosine, quite readily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As if I had not something better to do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rejoined he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); but I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) a piece of gold, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) took unscrupulously, and then
danced off to answer the door-bell, ringing just now every five
minutes, as the various servants came to fetch the half-boarders.

<p/>The reader must not think too hardly of Rosine; on the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) was
not a bad sort of person, and had no idea there could be any disgrace
in grasping at whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosine</b></font>) could get, or any effrontery in chattering
like a pie to the best gentleman in Christendom.

<p/>I had learnt something from the above scene besides what concerned the
ivory box: viz., that not on the robe de jaconas, pink or grey, nor yet
on the frilled and pocketed apron, lay the blame of breaking Dr. John's
heart: these items of array were obviously guiltless as Georgette's
little blue tunic. So much the better. But who then was the culprit?
What was the ground--what the origin--what the perfect explanation of
the whole business? Some points had been cleared, but how many yet
remained obscure as night!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``it is no affair of yours;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and turning
from the face on which I had been unconsciously dwelling with a
questioning gaze, I looked through the window which commanded the
garden below. Dr. John, meantime, standing by the bed-side, was slowly
drawing on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gloves and watching his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) little patient, as her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) eyes
closed and her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) rosy lips parted in coming sleep. I waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
should depart as usual, with a quick bow and scarce articulate
<div class="bookquote">``good-night.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hat, my eyes, fixed on the tall
houses bounding the garden, saw the one lattice, already commemorated,
cautiously open; forth from the aperture projected a hand and a white
handkerchief; both waved. I know not whether the signal was answered
from some viewless quarter of our own dwelling; but immediately after
there fluttered from, the lattice a falling object, white and
light--billet the second, of course.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ejaculated involuntarily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?'' (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>, asked Dr. John with energy, making direct for the window.
<div class="bookquote">``What, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have gone and done it again,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my reply. <div class="bookquote">``A handkerchief waved
and something fell:''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I pointed to the lattice, now closed and
looking hypocritically blank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, at once; pick it up and bring it here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) prompt direction;
adding, <div class="bookquote">``Nobody will take notice of _you: I_ should be seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Straight I went. After some little search, I found a folded paper,
lodged on the lower branch of a shrub; I seized and brought it direct
to Dr. John. This time, I believe not even Rosine saw me.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) instantly tore the billet into small pieces, without reading it. <div class="bookquote">``It
is not in the least _her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ fault, you must remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, looking
at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Whose_ fault?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">''_Who_ is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't yet know, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you no guess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I knew you better, I might be tempted to risk some confidence, and
thus secure you as guardian over a most innocent and excellent, but
somewhat inexperienced being.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a duenna?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) abstractedly. <div class="bookquote">``What snares are round her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added,
musingly: and now, certainly for the first time, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) examined my face,
anxious, doubtless, to see if any kindly expression there, would
warrant him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in recommending to my care and indulgence some ethereal
creature, against whom powers of darkness were plotting. I felt no
particular vocation to undertake the surveillance of ethereal
creatures; but recalling the scene at the bureau, it seemed to me that
I owed _him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_ a good turn: if I _could_ help him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) then I would, and it
lay not with me to decide how. With as little reluctance as might be, I
intimated that <div class="bookquote">``I was willing to do what I could towards taking care of
any person in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might be interested.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am no farther interested than as a spectator,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), with a
modesty, admirable, as I thought, to witness. <div class="bookquote">``I happen to be
acquainted with the rather worthless character of the person, who, from
the house opposite, has now twice invaded the sanctity of this place; I
have also met in society the object at whom these vulgar attempts are
aimed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) exquisite superiority and innate refinement ought, one would
think, to scare impertinence from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) very idea. It is not so, however;
and innocent, unsuspicious as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is, I would guard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) from evil if I
could. In person, however, I can do nothing I cannot come near her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am willing to help you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``only tell me how.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And
busily, in my own mind, I ran over the list of our inmates, seeking
this paragon, this pearl of great price, this gem without flaw. <div class="bookquote">``It
must be Madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I concluded. ''_She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ only, amongst us all, has the art
even to _seem_ superior: but as to being unsuspicious, inexperienced,
&c., Dr. John need not distract himself about that. However, this is
just his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) whim, and I will not contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shall be humoured: his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
angel shall be an angel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just notify the quarter to which my care is to be directed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
continued gravely: chuckling, however, to myself over the thought of
being set to chaperon Madame Beck or any of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pupils. Now Dr. John
had a fine set of nerves, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) at once felt by instinct, what no more
coarsely constituted mind would have detected; namely, that I was a
little amused at him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). The colour rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cheek; with half a smile
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned and took his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hat--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was going. My heart smote me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will--I will help you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I will do what you wish. I
will watch over your angel; I will take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), only tell me who
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you _must_ know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) then with earnestness, yet speaking very
low. <div class="bookquote">``So spotless, so good, so unspeakably beautiful! impossible that
one house should contain two like her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I allude, of course--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the latch of Madame Beck's chamber-door -LRB-opening into the nursery-RRB-
gave a sudden click, as if the hand holding it had been slightly
convulsed; there was the suppressed explosion of an irrepressible
sneeze. These little accidents will happen to the best of us.
Madame--excellent woman! was then on duty. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come home quietly,
stolen up-stairs on tip-toe; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chamber. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not
sneezed, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have heard all, and so should I; but that unlucky
sternutation routed Dr. John. While he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stood aghast, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came forward
alert, composed, in the best yet most tranquil spirits: no novice to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) habits but would have thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had just come in, and scouted the
idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ear having been glued to the key-hole for at least ten
minutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affected to sneeze again, declared she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``enrhumée,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
then proceeded volubly to recount her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``courses en fiacre.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The
prayer-bell rang, and I left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with the doctor.




<p/>CHAPTER XIV.

<p/>THE FÊTE.


<p/>As soon as Georgette was well, Madame sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) away into the country. I
was sorry; I loved the child, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) loss made me poorer than before.
But I must not complain. I lived in a house full of robust life; I
might have had companions, and I chose solitude. Each of the teachers
in turn made me overtures of special intimacy; I tried them all. One I
found to be an honest woman, but a narrow thinker, a coarse feeler, and
an egotist. The second was a Parisienne, externally refined--at heart,
corrupt--without a creed, without a principle, without an affection:
having penetrated the outward crust of decorum in this character, you
found a slough beneath. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a wonderful passion for presents; and,
in this point, the third teacher--a person otherwise characterless and
insignificant--closely resembled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). This last-named had also one
other distinctive property--that of avarice. In her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reigned the love of
money for its own sake. The sight of a piece of gold would bring into
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes a green glisten, singular to witness. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once, as a mark of
high favour, took me up-stairs, and, opening a secret door, showed me a
hoard--a mass of coarse, large coin--about fifteen guineas, in
five-franc pieces. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved this hoard as a bird loves its eggs. These
were her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) savings. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would come and talk to me about them with an
infatuated and persevering dotage, strange to behold in a person not
yet twenty-five.

<p/>The Parisienne, on the other hand, was prodigal and profligate -LRB-in
disposition, that is: as to action, I do not know-RRB-. That latter quality
showed its snake-head to me but once, peeping out very cautiously. A
curious kind of reptile it seemed, judging from the glimpse I got; its
novelty whetted my curiosity: if it would have come out boldly, perhaps
I might philosophically have stood my ground, and coolly surveyed the
long thing from forked tongue to scaly tail-tip; but it merely rustled
in the leaves of a bad novel; and, on encountering a hasty and
ill-advised demonstration of wrath, recoiled and vanished, hissing. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
hated me from that day.

<p/>This Parisienne was always in debt; her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) salary being anticipated, not
only in dress, but in perfumes, cosmetics, confectionery, and
condiments. What a cold, callous epicure she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was in all things! I see
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now. Thin in face and figure, sallow in complexion, regular in
features, with perfect teeth, lips like a thread, a large, prominent
chin, a well-opened, but frozen eye, of light at once craving and
ingrate. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mortally hated work, and loved what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) called pleasure;
being an insipid, heartless, brainless dissipation of time.

<p/>Madame Beck knew this woman's character perfectly well. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once talked
to me about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), with an odd mixture of discrimination, indifference,
and antipathy. I asked why she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the establishment. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
answered plainly, <div class="bookquote">``because it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) interest to do so;''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and
pointed out a fact I had already noticed, namely, that Mademoiselle St.
Pierre possessed, in an almost unique degree, the power of keeping
order amongst her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) undisciplined ranks of scholars. A certain petrifying
influence accompanied and surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): without passion, noise, or
violence, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held them in check as a breezeless frost-air might still
a brawling stream. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was of little use as far as communication of
knowledge went, but for strict surveillance and maintenance of rules
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was invaluable. <div class="bookquote">``Je sais bien qu'elle n'a pas de principes, ni,
peut-être, de moeurs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>admitted Madame frankly; but added with
philosophy, <div class="bookquote">``son maintien en classe est toujours convenable et rempli
même d'une certaine dignité: c'est tout ce qu'il faut. Ni les élèves ni
les parents ne regardent plus loin; ni, par conséquent, moi non plus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>A strange, frolicsome, noisy little world was this school: great pains
were taken to hide chains with flowers: a subtle essence of Romanism
pervaded every arrangement: large sensual indulgence -LRB-so to speak-RRB- was
permitted by way of counterpoise to jealous spiritual restraint. Each
mind was being reared in slavery; but, to prevent reflection from
dwelling on this fact, every pretext for physical recreation was seized
and made the most of. There, as elsewhere, the CHURCH strove to bring
up her children robust in body, feeble in soul, fat, ruddy, hale,
joyous, ignorant, unthinking, unquestioning. <div class="bookquote">``Eat, drink, and live!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) says. <div class="bookquote">``Look after your bodies; leave your souls to me. I hold their
cure--guide their course: I guarantee their final fate.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catholic</b></font>)</div>A bargain, in
which every true Catholic deems himself a gainer. Lucifer just offers
the same terms: <div class="bookquote">``All this power will I give thee, and the glory of it;
for that is delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it. If
thou, therefore, wilt worship me, all shall be thine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucifer</b></font>)</div><p/>About this time--in the ripest glow of summer--Madame Beck's house
became as merry a place as a school could well be. All day long the
broad folding-doors and the two-leaved casements stood wide open:
settled sunshine seemed naturalized in the atmosphere; clouds were far
off, sailing away beyond sea, resting, no doubt, round islands such as
England--that dear land of mists--but withdrawn wholly from the drier
continent. We lived far more in the garden than under a roof: classes
were held, and meals partaken of, in the <div class="bookquote">``grand berceau.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Moreover,
there was a note of holiday preparation, which almost turned freedom
into licence. The autumnal long vacation was but two months distant;
but before that, a great day--an important ceremony--none other than
the fête of Madame--awaited celebration.

<p/>The conduct of this fête devolved chiefly on Mademoiselle St. Pierre:
Madame herself being supposed to stand aloof, disinterestedly
unconscious of what might be going forward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) honour. Especially,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) never knew, never in the least suspected, that a subscription was
annually levied on the whole school for the purchase of a handsome
present. The polite tact of the reader will please to leave out of the
account a brief, secret consultation on this point in Madame's own
chamber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you have this year?''  (<font color='red'><b>lieutenant</b></font>)</div>was asked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) Parisian lieutenant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no matter! Let it alone. Let the poor children keep their francs,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>And Madame looked benign and modest.

<p/>The St. Pierre would here protrude her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) chin; she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) knew Madame by heart;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) always called her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) airs of <div class="bookquote">``bonté'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``des grimaces.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) never even
professed to respect them one instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vite!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) would say coldly. <div class="bookquote">``Name the article. Shall it be jewellery
or porcelain, haberdashery or silver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh bien! Deux ou trois cuillers, et autant de fourchettes en argent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the result was a handsome case, containing 300 francs worth of
plate.

<p/>The programme of the fête-day's proceedings comprised: Presentation of
plate, collation in the garden, dramatic performance -LRB-with pupils and
teachers for actors-RRB-, a dance and supper. Very gorgeous seemed the
effect of the whole to me, as I well remember. Zélie St. Pierre
understood these things and managed them ably.

<p/>The play was the main point; a month's previous drilling being there
required. The choice, too, of the actors required knowledge and care;
then came lessons in elocution, in attitude, and then the fatigue of
countless rehearsals. For all this, as may well be supposed, St. Pierre
did not suffice: other management, other accomplishments than hers were
requisite here. They were supplied in the person of a master--M. Paul
Emanuel, professor of literature. It was never my lot to be present at
the histrionic lessons of M. Paul, but I often saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) crossed
the _carré_ -LRB-a square hall between the dwelling-house and
school-house-RRB-. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), too, in the warm evenings, lecturing with
open doors, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) name, with anecdotes of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), resounded in ones ears
from all sides. Especially our former acquaintance, Miss Ginevra
Fanshawe,--who had been selected to take a prominent part in the
play--used, in bestowing upon me a large portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) leisure, to
lard her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) discourse with frequent allusions to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sayings and doings.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) esteemed him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hideously plain, and used to profess herself
frightened almost into hysterics at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) step or voice. A
dark little man he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) certainly was; pungent and austere. Even to me he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
seemed a harsh apparition, with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) close-shorn, black head, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) broad,
sallow brow, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thin cheek, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wide and quivering nostril, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
thorough glance, and hurried bearing. Irritable he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was; one heard that,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) apostrophized with vehemence the awkward squad under his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) orders.
Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) would break out on these raw amateur actresses with a
passion of impatience at their falseness of conception, their coldness
of emotion, their feebleness of delivery. <div class="bookquote">``Ecoutez!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) would cry; and
then his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) voice rang through the premises like a trumpet; and when,
mimicking it, came the small pipe of a Ginevra, a Mathilde, or a
Blanche, one understood why a hollow groan of scorn, or a fierce hiss
of rage, rewarded the tame echo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vous n'êtes donc que des poupées,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thunder. <div class="bookquote">``Vous n'avez
pas de passions--vous autres. Vous ne sentez donc rien? Votre chair est
de neige, votre sang de glace! Moi, je veux que tout cela s`allume,
qu'il ait une vie, une âme!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Vain resolve! And when he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) at last found it _was_ vain, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) suddenly
broke the whole business down. Hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had been teaching them a
grand tragedy; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) tore the tragedy in morsels, and came next day with a
compact little comic trifle. To this they took more kindly; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
presently knocked it all into their smooth round pates.

<p/>Mademoiselle St. Pierre always presided at M. Emanuel's lessons, and I
was told that the polish of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) seeming attention, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) tact
and grace, impressed that gentleman very favourably. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had, indeed,
the art of pleasing, for a given time, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) would; but the feeling
would not last: in an hour it was dried like dew, vanished like
gossamer.

<p/>The day preceding Madame's fête was as much a holiday as the fête
itself. It was devoted to clearing out, cleaning, arranging and
decorating the three schoolrooms. All within-doors was the gayest
bustle; neither up-stairs nor down could a quiet, isolated person find
rest for the sole of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) foot; accordingly, for my part, I took refuge
in the garden. The whole day did I wander or sit there alone, finding
warmth in the sun, shelter among the trees, and a sort of companionship
in my own thoughts. I well remember that I exchanged but two sentences
that day with any living being: not that I felt solitary; I was glad to
be quiet. For a looker-on, it sufficed to pass through the rooms once
or twice, observe what changes were being wrought, how a green-room and
a dressing-room were being contrived, a little stage with scenery
erected, how M. Paul Emanuel, in conjunction with Mademoiselle St.
Pierre, was directing all, and how an eager band of pupils, amongst
them Ginevra Fanshawe, were working gaily under his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) control.

<p/>The great day arrived. The sun rose hot and unclouded, and hot and
unclouded it burned on till evening. All the doors and all the windows
were set open, which gave a pleasant sense of summer freedom--and
freedom the most complete seemed indeed the order of the day. Teachers
and pupils descended to breakfast in dressing-gowns and curl-papers:
anticipating <div class="bookquote">``avec délices''  (<font color='red'><b>pupils</b></font>)</div>the toilette of the evening, they seemed to
take a pleasure in indulging that forenoon in a luxury of slovenliness;
like aldermen fasting in preparation for a feast. About nine o'clock
A.M., an important functionary, the <div class="bookquote">``coiffeur,''  (<font color='red'><b>an functionary coiffeur</b></font>)</div>arrived. Sacrilegious
to state, he (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) head-quarters in the oratory, and there, in
presence of _bénitier_, candle, and crucifix, solemnised the mysteries
of his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) art. Each girl was summoned in turn to pass through his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) hands;
emerging from them with head as smooth as a shell, intersected by
faultless white lines, and wreathed about with Grecian plaits that
shone as if lacquered. I took my turn with the rest, and could hardly
believe what the glass said when I applied to it for information
afterwards; the lavished garlandry of woven brown hair amazed me--I
feared it was not all my own, and it required several convincing pulls
to give assurance to the contrary. I then acknowledged in the coiffeur
a first-rate artist--one who certainly made the most of indifferent
materials.

<p/>The oratory closed, the dormitory became the scene of ablutions,
arrayings and bedizenings curiously elaborate. To me it was, and ever
must be an enigma, how they contrived to spend so much time in doing so
little. The operation seemed close, intricate, prolonged: the result
simple. A clear white muslin dress, a blue sash -LRB-the Virgin's colours-RRB-,
a pair of white, or straw-colour kid gloves--such was the gala uniform,
to the assumption whereof that houseful of teachers and pupils devoted
three mortal hours. But though simple, it must be allowed the array was
perfect--perfect in fashion, fit, and freshness; every head being also
dressed with exquisite nicety, and a certain compact taste--suiting the
full, firm comeliness of Labassecourien contours, though too stiff for
any more flowing and flexible style of beauty--the general effect was,
on the whole, commendable.

<p/>In beholding this diaphanous and snowy mass, I well remember feeling
myself to be a mere shadowy spot on a field of light; the courage was
not in me to put on a transparent white dress: something thin I must
wear--the weather and rooms being too hot to give substantial fabrics
sufferance, so I had sought through a dozen shops till I lit upon a
crape-like material of purple-gray--the colour, in short, of dun mist,
lying on a moor in bloom. My _tailleuse_ had kindly made it as well as
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could: because, as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) judiciously observed, it was <div class="bookquote">``si triste--si
pen voyant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>care in the fashion was the more imperative: it was well
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took this view of the matter, for I, had no flower, no jewel to
relieve it: and, what was more, I had no natural rose of complexion.

<p/>We become oblivious of these deficiencies in the uniform routine of
daily drudgery, but they _will_ force upon us their unwelcome blank on
those bright occasions when beauty should shine.

<p/>However, in this same gown of shadow, I felt at home and at ease; an
advantage I should not have enjoyed in anything more brilliant or
striking. Madame Beck, too, kept me in countenance; her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) dress was
almost as quiet as mine, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wore a bracelet, and a large
brooch bright with gold and fine stones. We chanced to meet on the
stairs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gave me a nod and smile of approbation. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
thought I was looking well--a point unlikely to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
interest--but she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) considered me dressed <div class="bookquote">``convenablement,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``décemment,''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and la Convenance et la Décence were the two calm deities of Madame's
worship. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) even paused, laid on my shoulder her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gloved hand, holding
an embroidered and perfumed handkerchief, and confided to my ear a
sarcasm on the other teachers -LRB-whom she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had just been complimenting to
their faces-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing so absurd,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as for des femmes mûres
`to dress themselves like girls of fifteen'--quant à la.. St. Pierre,
elle a l'air d'une vieille coquette qui fait l'ingénue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Being dressed at least a couple of hours before anybody else, I felt a
pleasure in betaking myself--not to the garden, where servants were
busy propping up long tables, placing seats, and spreading cloths in
readiness for the collation but to the schoolrooms, now empty, quiet,
cool, and clean; their walls fresh stained, their planked floors fresh
scoured and scarce dry; flowers fresh gathered adorning the recesses in
pots, and draperies, fresh hung, beautifying the great windows.

<p/>Withdrawing to the first classe, a smaller and neater room than the
others, and taking from the glazed bookcase, of which I kept the key, a
volume whose title promised some interest, I sat down to read. The
glass-door of this <div class="bookquote">``classe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>or schoolroom, opened into the large
berceau; acacia-boughs caressed its panes, as they stretched across to
meet a rose-bush blooming by the opposite lintel: in this rose-bush
bees murmured busy and happy. I commenced reading. Just as the stilly
hum, the embowering shade, the warm, lonely calm of my retreat were
beginning to steal meaning from the page, vision from my eyes, and to
lure me along the track of reverie, down into some deep dell of
dreamland--just then, the sharpest ring of the street-door bell to
which that much-tried instrument had ever thrilled, snatched me back to
consciousness.

<p/>Now the bell had been ringing all the morning, as workmen, or servants,
or _coiffeurs_, or _tailleuses_, went and came on their several
errands. Moreover, there was good reason to expect it would ring all
the afternoon, since about one hundred externes were yet to arrive in
carriages or fiacres: nor could it be expected to rest during the
evening, when parents and friends would gather thronging to the play.
Under these circumstances, a ring--even a sharp ring--was a matter of
course: yet this particular peal had an accent of its own, which chased
my dream, and startled my book from my knee.

<p/>I was stooping to pick up this last, when--firm, fast, straight--right
on through vestibule--along corridor, across carré, through first
division, second division, grand salle--strode a step, quick, regular,
intent. The closed door of the first classe--my sanctuary--offered no
obstacle; it burst open, and a paletôt and a bonnet grec filled the
void; also two eyes first vaguely struck upon, and then hungrily dived
into me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'est cela!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice. ``Je la connais: c'est l<div class="bookquote">``Anglaise. Tant pis.
Toute Anglaise, et, par conséquent, toute bégueule qu'elle soit--elle
fera mon affaire, ou je saurai pourquoi.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, with a certain stern politeness -LRB-I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thought I had not
caught the drift of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) previous uncivil mutterings-RRB-, and in a jargon
the most execrable that ever was heard, <div class="bookquote">``Meess--, play you must: I am
planted there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you, M. Paul Emanuel?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired: for M. Paul
Emanuel it was, and in a state of no little excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Play you must. I will not have you shrink, or frown, or make the
prude. I read your skull that night you came; I see your moyens: play
you can; play you must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how, M. Paul? What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no time to be lost,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) went on, now speaking in French; <div class="bookquote">``and
let us thrust to the wall all reluctance, all excuses, all minauderies.
You must take a part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>French</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the vaudeville?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the vaudeville. You have said it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I gasped, horror-struck. _What_ did the little man mean?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The case shall be stated, and you shall then answer
me Yes, or No; and according to your answer shall I ever after estimate
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The scarce-suppressed impetus of a most irritable nature glowed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cheek, fed with sharp shafts his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glances, a nature--the injudicious,
the mawkish, the hesitating, the sullen, the affected, above all, the
unyielding, might quickly render violent and implacable. Silence and
attention was the best balm to apply: I listened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole matter is going to fail,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began. <div class="bookquote">``Louise Vanderkelkov has
fallen ill--at least so her (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) ridiculous mother asserts; for my part, I
feel sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) might play if she (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) would: it is only good-will that lacks.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Louise</b></font>) was charged with a _rôle_, as you know, or do _not_ know--it is
equal: without that _rôle_ the play is stopped. There are now but a few
hours in which to learn it: not a girl in this school would hear
reason, and accept the task. Forsooth, it is not an interesting, not an
amiable, part; their vile _amour-propre_--that base quality of which
women have so much--would revolt from it. Englishwomen are either the
best or the worst of their sex. Dieu sait que je les déteste comme la
peste, ordinairement''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recreant teeth-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``I apply to an
Englishwoman to rescue me. What is her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) answer--Yes, or No?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A thousand objections rushed into my mind. The foreign language, the
limited time, the public display... Inclination recoiled, Ability
faltered, Self-respect -LRB-that <div class="bookquote">``vile quality'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB- trembled. <div class="bookquote">``Non, non, non!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said all these; but looking up at M. Paul, and seeing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) vexed,
fiery, and searching eye, a sort of appeal behind all its menace, my
lips dropped the word <div class="bookquote">``oui'' (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>. For a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rigid countenance relaxed
with a quiver of content: quickly bent up again, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went on,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vite à l'ouvrage! Here is the book; here is your _rôle_: read.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And I
read. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not commend; at some passages he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) scowled and stamped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
gave me a lesson: I diligently imitated. It was a disagreeable part--a
man's--an empty-headed fop's. One could put into it neither heart nor
soul: I hated it. The play--a mere trifle--ran chiefly on the efforts
of a brace of rivals to gain the hand of a fair coquette. One lover was
called the <div class="bookquote">``Ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>a good and gallant but unpolished man, a sort of
diamond in the rough; the other was a butterfly, a talker, and a
traitor: and I was to be the butterfly, talker, and traitor.

<p/>I did my best--which was bad, I know: it provoked M. Paul; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fumed.
Putting both hands to the work, I endeavoured to do better than my
best; I presume he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave me credit for good intentions; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) professed to
be partially content. <div class="bookquote">``Ca ira!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried; and as voices began sounding
from the garden, and white dresses fluttering among the trees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
added: <div class="bookquote">``You must withdraw: you must be alone to learn this. Come with
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Without being allowed time or power to deliberate, I found myself in
the same breath convoyed along as in a species of whirlwind, up-stairs,
up two pair of stairs, nay, actually up three -LRB-for this fiery little
man seemed as by instinct to know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way everywhere-RRB-; to the solitary
and lofty attic was I borne, put in and locked in, the key being, in
the door, and that key he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and vanished.

<p/>The attic was no pleasant place: I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know how
unpleasant it was, or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never would have locked me in with so little
ceremony. In this summer weather, it was hot as Africa; as in winter,
it was always cold as Greenland. Boxes and lumber filled it; old
dresses draped its unstained wall--cobwebs its unswept ceiling. Well
was it known to be tenanted by rats, by black beetles, and by
cockroaches--nay, rumour affirmed that the ghostly Nun of the garden
had once been seen here. A partial darkness obscured one end, across
which, as for deeper mystery, an old russet curtain was drawn, by way
of screen to a sombre band of winter cloaks, pendent each from its pin,
like a malefactor from his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gibbet. From amongst these cloaks, and
behind that curtain, the Nun was said to issue. I did not believe this,
nor was I troubled by apprehension thereof; but I saw a very dark and
large rat, with a long tail, come gliding out from that squalid alcove;
and, moreover, my eye fell on many a black-beetle, dotting the floor.
These objects discomposed me more, perhaps, than it would be wise to
say, as also did the dust, lumber, and stifling heat of the place. The
last inconvenience would soon have become intolerable, had I not found
means to open and prop up the skylight, thus admitting some freshness.
Underneath this aperture I pushed a large empty chest, and having
mounted upon it a smaller box, and wiped from both the dust, I gathered
my dress -LRB-my best, the reader must remember, and therefore a legitimate
object of care-RRB- fastidiously around me, ascended this species of
extempore throne, and being seated, commenced the acquisition of my
task; while I learned, not forgetting to keep a sharp look-out on the
black-beetles and cockroaches, of which, more even, I believe, than of
the rats, I sat in mortal dread.

<p/>My impression at first was that I had undertaken what it really was
impossible to perform, and I simply resolved to do my best and be
resigned to fail. I soon found, however, that one part in so short a
piece was not more than memory could master at a few hours' notice. I
learned and learned on, first in a whisper, and then aloud. Perfectly
secure from human audience, I acted my part before the garret-vermin.
Entering into its emptiness, frivolity, and falsehood, with a spirit
inspired by scorn and impatience, I took my revenge on this <div class="bookquote">``fat,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>by
making him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) as fatuitous as I possibly could.

<p/>In this exercise the afternoon passed: day began to glide into evening;
and I, who had eaten nothing since breakfast, grew excessively hungry.
Now I thought of the collation, which doubtless they were just then
devouring in the garden far below. -LRB-I had seen in the vestibule a
basketful of small _pâtés à la crême_, than which nothing in the whole
range of cookery seemed to me better-RRB-. A _pâté_, or a square of cake,
it seemed to me would come very _àpropos;_ and as my relish for those
dainties increased, it began to appear somewhat hard that I should pass
my holiday, fasting and in prison. Remote as was the attic from the
street-door and vestibule, yet the ever-tinkling bell was faintly
audible here; and also the ceaseless roll of wheels, on the tormented
pavement. I knew that the house and garden were thronged, and that all
was gay and glad below; here it began to grow dusk: the beetles were
fading from my sight; I trembled lest they should steal on me a march,
mount my throne unseen, and, unsuspected, invade my skirts. Impatient
and apprehensive, I recommenced the rehearsal of my part merely to kill
time. Just as I was concluding, the long-delayed rattle of the key in
the lock came to my ear--no unwelcome sound. M. Paul -LRB-I could just see
through the dusk that it _was_ M. Paul, for light enough still lingered
to show the velvet blackness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) close-shorn head, and the sallow
ivory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brow-RRB- looked in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brava!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), holding the door open and remaining at the
threshold. <div class="bookquote">``J'ai tout entendu. C'est assez bien. Encore!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment I hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Encore!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sternly. <div class="bookquote">``Et point de grimaces! A bas la timidité!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Again I went through the part, but not half so well as I had spoken it
alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enfin, elle sait,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), half dissatisfied, <div class="bookquote">``and one cannot be
fastidious or exacting under the circumstances.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``You
may yet have twenty minutes for preparation: au revoir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
going.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called out, taking courage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh bien! Qu'est-ce que c'est, Mademoiselle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``J'ai bien faim.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Comment, vous avez faim! Et la collation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about it. I have not seen it, shut up here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! C'est vrai,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>In a moment my throne was abdicated, the attic evacuated; an inverse
repetition of the impetus which had brought me up into the attic,
instantly took me down--down--down to the very kitchen. I thought I
should have gone to the cellar. The cook was imperatively ordered to
produce food, and I, as imperatively, was commanded to eat. To my great
joy this food was limited to coffee and cake: I had feared wine and
sweets, which I did not like. How he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) guessed that I should like a
_petit pâté à la crême_ I cannot tell; but he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) went out and procured me
one from some quarter. With considerable willingness I ate and drank,
keeping the _petit pâté_ till the last, as a _bonne bouche_. M. Paul
superintended my repast, and almost forced upon me more than I could
swallow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A la bonne heure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried, when I signified that I really could take
no more, and, with uplifted hands, implored to be spared the additional
roll on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had just spread butter. <div class="bookquote">``You will set me down as a
species of tyrant and Bluebeard, starving women in a garret; whereas,
after all, I am no such thing. Now, Mademoiselle, do you feel courage
and strength to appear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said, I thought I did; though, in truth, I was perfectly confused,
and could hardly tell how I felt: but this little man was of the order
of beings who must not be opposed, unless you possessed an all-dominant
force sufficient to crush him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), offering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/>I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set off with a rapid walk, which obliged me to
run at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side in order to keep pace. In the carré he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped a
moment: it was lit with large lamps; the wide doors of the classes were
open, and so were the equally wide garden-doors; orange-trees in tubs,
and tall flowers in pots, ornamented these portals on each side; groups
of ladies and gentlemen in evening-dress stood and walked amongst the
flowers. Within, the long vista of the school-rooms presented a
thronging, undulating, murmuring, waving, streaming multitude, all
rose, and blue, and half translucent white. There were lustres burning
overhead; far off there was a stage, a solemn green curtain, a row of
footlights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nest-ce pas que c'est beau?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>demanded my companion.

<p/>I should have said it was, but my heart got up into my throat. M. Paul
discovered this, and gave me a side-scowl and a little shake for my
pains.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do my best, but I wish it was over,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; then I asked: <div class="bookquote">``Are
we to walk through that crowd?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means: I manage matters better: we pass through the
garden--here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In an instant we were out of doors: the cool, calm night revived me
somewhat. It was moonless, but the reflex from the many glowing windows
lit the court brightly, and even the alleys--dimly. Heaven was
cloudless, and grand with the quiver of its living fires. How soft are
the nights of the Continent! How bland, balmy, safe! No sea-fog; no
chilling damp: mistless as noon, and fresh as morning.

<p/>Having crossed court and garden, we reached the glass door of the first
classe. It stood open, like all other doors that night; we passed, and
then I was ushered into a small cabinet, dividing the first classe from
the grand salle. This cabinet dazzled me, it was so full of light: it
deafened me, it was clamorous with voices: it stifled me, it was so
hot, choking, thronged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``De l'ordre! Du silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>cried M. Paul. <div class="bookquote">``Is this chaos?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) demanded;
and there was a hush. With a dozen words, and as many gestures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
turned out half the persons present, and obliged the remnant to fall
into rank. Those left were all in costume: they were the performers,
and this was the green-room. M. Paul introduced me. All stared and some
tittered. It was a surprise: they had not expected the Englishwoman
would play in a _vaudeville_. Ginevra Fanshawe, beautifully dressed for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) part, and looking fascinatingly pretty, turned on me a pair of eyes
as round as beads. In the highest spirit, unperturbed by fear or
bashfulness, delighted indeed at the thought of shining off before
hundreds--my entrance seemed to transfix her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) with amazement in the
midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) joy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would have exclaimed, but M. Paul held her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) and
all the rest in check.

<p/>Having surveyed and criticized the whole troop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, too, must be dressed for your part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dressed--dressed like a man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Zélie/Zélie St. Pierre</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Zélie St. Pierre, darting
forwards; adding with officiousness, <div class="bookquote">``I will dress her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Zélie/Zélie St. Pierre</b></font>)</div><p/>To be dressed like a man did not please, and would not suit me. I had
consented to take a man's name and part; as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dress--_halte là!_
No. I would keep my own dress, come what might. M. Paul might storm,
might rage: I would keep my own dress. I said so, with a voice as
resolute in intent, as it was low, and perhaps unsteady in utterance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not immediately storm or rage, as I fully thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
stood silent. But Zélie again interposed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will make a capital _petit-mâitre_. Here are the garments,
all--all complete: somewhat too large, but--I will arrange all that.
Come, chère amie--belle Anglaise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sneered, for I was not <div class="bookquote">``belle.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seized my hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was
drawing me away. M. Paul stood impassable--neutral.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not resist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle/Pierre/Mademoiselle St. Pierre</b></font>)</div>pursued St. Pierre--for resist I did. <div class="bookquote">``You will
spoil all, destroy the mirth of the piece, the enjoyment of the
company, sacrifice everything to your _amour-propre_. This would be too
bad--monsieur will never permit this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sought his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) eye. I watched, likewise, for a glance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) one,
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) gave me one. <div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) said slowly, arresting St. Pierre,
who continued her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) efforts to drag me after her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Everybody awaited the
decision. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) was not angry, not irritated; I perceived that, and took
heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not like these clothes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) asked, pointing to the masculine
vestments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't object to some of them, but I won't have them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How must it be, then? How accept a man's part, and go on the stage
dressed as a woman? This is an amateur affair, it is true--a
_vaudeville de pensionnat;_ certain modifications I might sanction, yet
something you must have to announce you as of the nobler sex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I will, Monsieur; but it must be arranged in my own way: nobody
must meddle; the things must not be forced upon me. Just let me dress
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur/Monsieur Paul/MONSIEUR</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur, without another word, took the costume from St. Pierre, gave
it to me, and permitted me to pass into the dressing-room. Once alone,
I grew calm, and collectedly went to work. Retaining my woman's garb
without the slightest retrenchment, I merely assumed, in addition, a
little vest, a collar, and cravat, and a paletôt of small dimensions;
the whole being the costume of a brother of one of the pupils. Having
loosened my hair out of its braids, made up the long back-hair close,
and brushed the front hair to one side, I took my hat and gloves in my
hand and came out. M. Paul was waiting, and so were the others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
looked at me. <div class="bookquote">``That may pass in a pensionnat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pronounced. Then
added, not unkindly, <div class="bookquote">``Courage, mon ami! Un peu de sangfroid--un peu
d'aplomb, M. Lucien, et tout ira bien.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle/Pierre/Mademoiselle St. Pierre</b></font>)</div><p/>St. Pierre sneered again, in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) cold snaky manner.

<p/>I was irritable, because excited, and I could not help turning upon her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
and saying, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) were not a lady and I a gentleman, I should
feel disposed to call her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After the play, after the play,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>said M. Paul. <div class="bookquote">``I will then divide my
pair of pistols between you, and we will settle the dispute according
to form: it will only be the old quarrel of France and England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But now the moment approached for the performance to commence. M. Paul,
setting us before him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), harangued us briefly, like a general addressing
soldiers about to charge. I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
recommended each to penetrate herself with a sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) personal
insignificance. God knows I thought this advice superfluous for some of
us. A bell tinkled. I and two more were ushered on to the stage. The
bell tinkled again. I had to speak the very first words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not look at the crowd, nor think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>whispered M. Paul in my
ear. <div class="bookquote">``Imagine yourself in the garret, acting to the rats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) vanished. The curtain drew up--shrivelled to the ceiling: the bright
lights, the long room, the gay throng, burst upon us. I thought of the
black-beetles, the old boxes, the worm-eaten bureau. I said my say
badly; but I said it. That first speech was the difficulty; it revealed
to me this fact, that it was not the crowd I feared so much as my own
voice. Foreigners and strangers, the crowd were nothing to me. Nor did
I think of them. When my tongue once got free, and my voice took its
true pitch, and found its natural tone, I thought of nothing but the
personage I represented--and of M. Paul, who was listening, watching,
prompting in the side-scenes.

<p/>By-and-by, feeling the right power come--the spring demanded gush and
rise inwardly--I became sufficiently composed to notice my
fellow-actors. Some of them played very well; especially Ginevra
Fanshawe, who had to coquette between two suitors, and managed
admirably: in fact she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) element. I observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) once or
twice threw a certain marked fondness and pointed partiality into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
manner towards me--the fop. With such emphasis and animation did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
favour me, such glances did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) dart out into the listening and
applauding crowd, that to me--who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)--it presently became evident
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was acting _at_ some one; and I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) eye, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
gesture, and ere long discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had at least singled out a
handsome and distinguished aim for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) shafts; full in the path of
those arrows--taller than other spectators, and therefore more sure to
receive them--stood, in attitude quiet but intent, a well-known
form--that of Dr. John.

<p/>The spectacle seemed somehow suggestive. There was language in Dr.
John's look, though I cannot tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said; it animated me: I drew
out of it a history; I put my idea into the part I performed; I threw
it into my wooing of Ginevra. In the <div class="bookquote">``Ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>or sincere lover, I saw
Dr. John. Did I pity him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), as erst? No, I hardened my heart, rivalled
and out-rivalled him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). I knew myself but a fop, but where _he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_ was
outcast _I_ could please. Now I know I acted as if wishful and resolute
to win and conquer. Ginevra seconded me; between us we half-changed the
nature of the _rôle_, gilding it from top to toe. Between the acts M.
Paul, told us he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew not what possessed us, and half expostulated.
<div class="bookquote">``C'est peut-être plus beau que votre modèle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``mais ce n'est
pas juste.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I know not what possessed me either; but somehow, my
longing was to eclipse the <div class="bookquote">``Ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>_i.e._, Dr. John. Ginevra was
tender; how could I be otherwise than chivalric? Retaining the letter,
I recklessly altered the spirit of the _rôle_. Without heart, without
interest, I could not play it at all. It must be played--in went the
yearned-for seasoning--thus favoured, I played it with relish.

<p/>What I felt that night, and what I did, I no more expected to feel and
do, than to be lifted in a trance to the seventh heaven. Cold,
reluctant, apprehensive, I had accepted a part to please another: ere
long, warming, becoming interested, taking courage, I acted to please
myself. Yet the next day, when I thought it over, I quite disapproved
of these amateur performances; and though glad that I had obliged M.
Paul, and tried my own strength for once, I took a firm resolution,
never to be drawn into a similar affair. A keen relish for dramatic
expression had revealed itself as part of my nature; to cherish and
exercise this new-found faculty might gift me with a world of delight,
but it would not do for a mere looker-on at life: the strength and
longing must be put by; and I put them by, and fastened them in with
the lock of a resolution which neither Time nor Temptation has since
picked.

<p/>No sooner was the play over, and _well_ over, than the choleric and
arbitrary M. Paul underwent a metamorphosis. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hour of managerial
responsibility past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) at once laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) magisterial austerity;
in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood amongst us, vivacious, kind, and social, shook
hands with us all round, thanked us separately, and announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
determination that each of us should in turn be his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) partner in the
coming ball. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) claiming my promise, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) I did not dance.
<div class="bookquote">``For once I must,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was the answer; and if I had not slipped aside and
kept out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have compelled me to this second
performance. But I had acted enough for one evening; it was time I
retired into myself and my ordinary life. My dun-coloured dress did
well enough under a paletôt on the stage, but would not suit a waltz or
a quadrille. Withdrawing to a quiet nook, whence unobserved I could
observe--the ball, its splendours and its pleasures, passed before me
as a spectacle.

<p/>Again Ginevra Fanshawe was the belle, the fairest and the gayest
present; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was selected to open the ball: very lovely she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) looked,
very gracefully she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) danced, very joyously she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) smiled. Such scenes were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) triumphs--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was the child of pleasure. Work or suffering found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) listless and dejected, powerless and repining; but gaiety expanded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) butterfly's wings, lit up their gold-dust and bright spots, made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) flash like a gem, and flush like a flower. At all ordinary diet and
plain beverage she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would pout; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) fed on creams and ices like a
humming-bird on honey-paste: sweet wine was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) element, and sweet cake
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) daily bread. Ginevra lived her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) full life in a ball-room; elsewhere
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) drooped dispirited.

<p/>Think not, reader, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) thus bloomed and sparkled for the mere sake
of M. Paul, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) partner, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) lavished her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) best graces that
night for the edification of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) companions only, or for that of the
parents and grand-parents, who filled the carré, and lined the
ball-room; under circumstances so insipid and limited, with motives so
chilly and vapid, Ginevra would scarce have deigned to walk one
quadrille, and weariness and fretfulness would have replaced animation
and good-humour, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) knew of a leaven in the otherwise heavy festal
mass which lighted the whole; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) tasted a condiment which gave it
zest; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) perceived reasons justifying the display of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) choicest
attractions.

<p/>In the ball-room, indeed, not a single male spectator was to be seen
who was not married and a father--M. Paul excepted--that gentleman,
too, being the sole creature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sex permitted to lead out a pupil
to the dance; and this exceptional part was allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), partly as a
matter of old-established custom -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was a kinsman of Madame
Beck's, and high in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) confidence-RRB-, partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) would always
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) own way and do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) pleased, and partly because--wilful,
passionate, partial, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) might be--he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) was the soul of honour, and
might be trusted with a regiment of the fairest and purest; in perfect
security that under his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) leadership they would come to no harm. Many of
the girls--it may be noted in parenthesis--were not pure-minded at all,
very much otherwise; but they no more dare betray their natural
coarseness in M. Paul's presence, than they dare tread purposely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
corns, laugh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face during a stormy apostrophe, or speak above
their breath while some crisis of irritability was covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) human
visage with the mask of an intelligent tiger. M. Paul, then, might
dance with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would--and woe be to the interference which put him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
out of step.

<p/>Others there were admitted as spectators--with -LRB-seeming-RRB- reluctance,
through prayers, by influence, under restriction, by special and
difficult exercise of Madame Beck's gracious good-nature, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
all the evening--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own personal surveillance--kept far aloof at
the remotest, drearest, coldest, darkest side of the carré--a small,
forlorn band of <div class="bookquote">``jeunes gens;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>these being all of the best families,
grown-up sons of mothers present, and whose sisters were pupils in the
school. That whole evening was Madame on duty beside these <div class="bookquote">``jeunes
gens'' (<font color='red'><b>evening Madame</b></font>)</div>--attentive to them as a mother, but strict with them as a dragon.
There was a sort of cordon stretched before them, which they wearied
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with prayers to be permitted to pass, and just to revive themselves
by one dance with that <div class="bookquote">``belle blonde,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>or that <div class="bookquote">``jolie brune,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``cette
jeune fille magnifique aux cheveux noirs comme le jais.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Taisez-vous!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame would reply, heroically and inexorably. <div class="bookquote">``Vous ne
passerez pas à moins que ce ne soit sur mon cadavre, et vous ne
danserez qu'avec la nonnette du jardin''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-alluding to the legend-RRB-. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) majestically walked to and fro along their disconsolate and
impatient line, like a little Bonaparte in a mouse-coloured silk gown.

<p/>Madame knew something of the world; Madame knew much of human nature. I
don't think that another directress in Villette would have dared to
admit a <div class="bookquote">``jeune homme''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>within her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walls; but Madame knew that by
granting such admission, on an occasion like the present, a bold stroke
might be struck, and a great point gained.

<p/>In the first place, the parents were made accomplices to the deed, for
it was only through their mediation it was brought about. Secondly: the
admission of these rattlesnakes, so fascinating and so dangerous,
served to draw out Madame precisely in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) strongest character--that of
a first-rate _surveillante_. Thirdly: their presence furnished a most
piquant ingredient to the entertainment: the pupils knew it, and saw
it, and the view of such golden apples shining afar off, animated them
with a spirit no other circumstance could have kindled. The children's
pleasure spread to the parents; life and mirth circulated quickly round
the ball-room; the <div class="bookquote">``jeunes gens''  (<font color='red'><b>the parents</b></font>)</div>themselves, though restrained, were
amused: for Madame never permitted them to feel dull--and thus Madame
Beck's fête annually ensured a success unknown to the fête of any other
directress in the land.

<p/>I observed that Dr. John was at first permitted to walk at large
through the classes: there was about him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a manly, responsible look,
that redeemed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) youth, and half-expiated his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) beauty; but as soon as
the ball began, Madame ran up to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Wolf; come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), laughing: <div class="bookquote">``you wear sheep's clothing, but
you must quit the fold notwithstanding. Come; I have a fine menagerie
of twenty here in the carré: let me place you amongst my collection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But first suffer me to have one dance with one pupil of my choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you the face to ask such a thing? It is madness: it is impiety.
Sortez, sortez, au plus vite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) drove him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), and soon had him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) enclosed within the cordon.

<p/>Ginevra being, I suppose, tired with dancing, sought me out in my
retreat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) threw herself on the bench beside me, and -LRB-a demonstration
I could very well have dispensed with-RRB- cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) arms round my neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy Snowe! Lucy Snowe!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) cried in a somewhat sobbing voice, half
hysterical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What in the world is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I drily said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do I look--how do I look to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``preposterously vain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caustic creature! You never have a kind word for me; but in spite of
you, and all other envious detractors, I know I am beautiful; I feel
it, I see it--for there is a great looking-glass in the dressing-room,
where I can view my shape from head to foot. Will you go with me now,
and let us two stand before it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, Miss Fanshawe: you shall be humoured even to the top of your
bent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The dressing-room was very near, and we stepped in. Putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) arm
through mine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) drew me to the mirror. Without resistance
remonstrance, or remark, I stood and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) self-love have its feast
and triumph: curious to see how much it could swallow--whether it was
possible it could feed to satiety--whether any whisper of consideration
for others could penetrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) heart, and moderate its vainglorious
exultation.

<p/>Not at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) turned me and herself round; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) viewed us both on all
sides; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) smiled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) curls, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) retouched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) sash, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>)
spread her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) dress, and finally, letting go my arm, and curtseying with
mock respect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I would not be you for a kingdom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The remark was too _naïve_ to rouse anger; I merely said: <div class="bookquote">``Very good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what would _you_ give to be ME?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bad sixpence--strange as it may sound,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``You are but
a poor creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't think so in your heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; for in my heart you have not the outline of a place: I only
occasionally turn you over in my brain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>), in an expostulatory tone, <div class="bookquote">``just listen to the
difference of our positions, and then see how happy am I, and how
miserable are you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on; I listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``In the first place: I am the daughter of a gentleman of family, and
though my father is not rich, I have expectations from an uncle. Then,
I am just eighteen, the finest age possible. I have had a continental
education, and though I can't spell, I have abundant accomplishments. I
_am_ pretty; _you_ can't deny that; I may have as many admirers as I
choose. This very night I have been breaking the hearts of two
gentlemen, and it is the dying look I had from one of them just now,
which puts me in such spirits. I do so like to watch them turn red and
pale, and scowl and dart fiery glances at each other, and languishing
ones at me. There is _me_--happy ME; now for _you_, poor soul!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are nobody's daughter, since you took care of little
children when you first came to Villette: you have no relations; you
can't call yourself young at twenty-three; you have no attractive
accomplishments--no beauty. As to admirers, you hardly know what they
are; you can't even talk on the subject: you sit dumb when the other
teachers quote their conquests. I believe you never were in love, and
never will be: you don't know the feeling, and so much the better, for
though you might have your own heart broken, no living heart will you
ever break. Isn't it all true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good deal of it is true as gospel, and shrewd besides. There must be
good in you, Ginevra, to speak so honestly; that snake, Zélie St.
Pierre, could not utter what you have uttered. Still, Miss Fanshawe,
hapless as I am, according to your showing, sixpence I would not give
to purchase you, body and soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just because I am not clever, and that is all _you_ think of. Nobody
in the world but you cares for cleverness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I consider you _are_ clever, in your way--very smart
indeed. But you were talking of breaking hearts--that edifying
amusement into the merits of which I don't quite enter; pray on whom
does your vanity lead you to think you have done execution to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) lips to my ear--<div class="bookquote">``Isidore and Alfred de Hamal are
both here,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! they are? I should like to see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a dear creature! your curiosity is roused at last. Follow me,
I will point them out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) proudly led the way--<div class="bookquote">``But you cannot see them well from the
classes,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>), turning, <div class="bookquote">``Madame keeps them too far off. Let us
cross the garden, enter by the corridor, and get close to them behind:
we shall be scolded if we are seen, but never mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For once, I did not mind. Through the garden we went--penetrated into
the corridor by a quiet private entrance, and approaching the _carré_,
yet keeping in the corridor shade, commanded a near view of the band of
<div class="bookquote">``jeunes gens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I believe I could have picked out the conquering de Hamal even
undirected. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was a straight-nosed, very correct-featured little
dandy. I say _little_ dandy, though he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was not beneath the middle
standard in stature; but his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lineaments were small, and so were his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
hands and feet; and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was pretty and smooth, and as trim as a doll: so
nicely dressed, so nicely curled, so booted and gloved and cravated--he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
was charming indeed. I said so. <div class="bookquote">``What, a dear personage!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I, and
commended Ginevra's taste warmly; and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) thought de
Hamal might have done with the precious fragments of that heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) had
broken--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) kept them in a scent-vial, and conserved them in
otto of roses? I observed, too, with deep rapture of approbation, that
the colonel's hands were scarce larger than Miss Fanshawe's own, and
suggested that this circumstance might be convenient, as he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) could wear
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) gloves at a pinch. On his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) dear curls, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) I doated: and as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) low, Grecian brow, and exquisite classic headpiece, I confessed
I had no language to do such perfections justice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were your lover?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested the cruelly exultant Ginevra.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! heavens, what bliss!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``but do not be inhuman, Miss
Fanshawe: to put such thoughts into my head is like showing poor
outcast Cain a far, glimpse of Paradise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You like him (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I like sweets, and jams, and comfits, and conservatory flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ginevra/Miss Fanshawe/Ginevra Fanshawe</b></font>)</div><p/>Ginevra admired my taste, for all these things were her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) adoration; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>)
could then readily credit that they were mine too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now for Isidore,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on. I own I felt still more curious to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) than his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) rival; but Ginevra was absorbed in the latter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alfred was admitted here to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``through the influence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) aunt, Madame la Baronne de Dorlodot; and now, having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>),
can you not understand why I have been in such spirits all the evening,
and acted so well, and danced with such life, and why I am now happy as
a queen? Dieu! Dieu! It was such good fun to glance first at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) and
then at the other, and madden them both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that other--where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)? Show me Isidore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ashamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For what reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--because''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-in a whisper-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) has such--such whiskers,
orange--red--there now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The murder is out,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I subjoined. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, show him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) all the same; I
engage not to faint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) looked round. Just then an English voice spoke behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) and me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are both standing in a draught; you must leave this corridor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no draught, Dr. John,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, turning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) takes cold so easily,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) pursued, looking at Ginevra with extreme
kindness. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is delicate; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must be cared for: fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a shawl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Permit me to judge for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginevra/Miss Fanshawe/Ginevra Fanshawe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Fanshawe, with hauteur. <div class="bookquote">``I
want no shawl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your dress is thin, you have been dancing, you are heated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always preaching,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>retorted she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``always coddling and admonishing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The answer Dr. John would have given did not come; that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart was
hurt became evident in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eye; darkened, and saddened, and pained, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
turned a little aside, but was patient. I knew where there were plenty
of shawls near at hand; I ran and fetched one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shall wear this, if I have strength to make her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, folding
it well round her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) muslin dress, covering carefully her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) neck and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
arms. <div class="bookquote">``Is that Isidore?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, in a somewhat fierce whisper.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) pushed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) lip, smiled, and nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is _that_ Isidore?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) a shake: I could have given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) a dozen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'est lui-même,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How coarse he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is, compared with the
Colonel-Count! And then--oh ciel!--the whiskers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. John now passed on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Colonel-Count!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I echoed. <div class="bookquote">``The doll--the puppet--the manikin--the
poor inferior creature! A mere lackey for Dr. John his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) valet, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
foot-boy! Is it possible that fine generous gentleman--handsome as a
vision--offers you his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) honourable hand and gallant heart, and promises
to protect your flimsy person and feckless mind through the storms and
struggles of life--and you hang back--you scorn, you sting, you torture
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)! Have you power to do this? Who gave you that power? Where is it?
Does it lie all in your beauty--your pink and white complexion, and
your yellow hair? Does this bind his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) soul at your feet, and bend his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
neck under your yoke? Does this purchase for you his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) affection, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
tenderness, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thoughts, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hopes, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) interest, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) noble, cordial
love--and will you not have it? Do you scorn it? You are only
dissembling: you are not in earnest: you love him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); you long for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>);
but you trifle with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heart to make him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) more surely yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! How you run on! I don't understand half you have said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) out into the garden ere this. I now set her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) down on a
seat and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) should not stir till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had avowed which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
meant in the end to accept--the man or the monkey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) you call the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is bourgeois, sandy-haired, and
answers to the name of John!--cela suffit: je n'en veux pas. Colonel de
Hamal is a gentleman of excellent connections, perfect manners, sweet
appearance, with pale interesting face, and hair and eyes like an
Italian. Then too he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) is the most delightful company possible--a man
quite in my way; not sensible and serious like the other; but one with
whom I can talk on equal terms--who does not plague and bore, and
harass me with depths, and heights, and passions, and talents for which
I have no taste. There now. Don't hold me so fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I slackened my grasp, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) darted off. I did not care to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>).

<p/>Somehow I could not avoid returning once more in the direction of the
corridor to get another glimpse of Dr. John; but I met him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) on the
garden-steps, standing where the light from a window fell broad. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
well-proportioned figure was not to be mistaken, for I doubt whether
there was another in that assemblage his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) equal. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hat in
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) uncovered head, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face and fine brow were most handsome
and manly. _His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_ features were not delicate, not slight like those of a
woman, nor were they cold, frivolous, and feeble; though well cut, they
were not so chiselled, so frittered away, as to lose in expression or
significance what they gained in unmeaning symmetry. Much feeling spoke
in them at times, and more sat silent in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eye. Such at least were my
thoughts of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>): to me he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed all this. An inexpressible sense of
wonder occupied me, as I looked at this man, and reflected that _he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_
could not be slighted.

<p/>It was, not my intention to approach or address him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the garden, our
terms of acquaintance not warranting such a step; I had only meant to
view him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in the crowd--myself unseen: coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thus alone, I
withdrew. But he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was looking out for me, or rather for her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who had been
with me: therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) descended the steps, and followed me down the
alley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Miss Fanshawe? I have often wished to ask whether you knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Intimately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite as intimately as I wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) keeper?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt inclined to ask; but I simply answered, <div class="bookquote">``I
have shaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) well, and would have shaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) better, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) escaped
out of my hands and ran away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you favour me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``by watching over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) this one
evening, and observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) does nothing imprudent--does not, for

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may, perhaps, look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) a little; since you wish it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) is so young, so thoroughly artless,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) asked--much interested. <div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be difficult to say how--difficult, at least, to tell _you_
how.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) is not better pleased that you are so much her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) has not the slightest idea how much I _am_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) friend. That is

 (<font color='red'><b>Isidore/M. Isidore/ISIDORE</b></font>)</div><p/>``Under the name of ``Isidore' she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) has talked about you often; but I must

brief space of time I have learned that Ginevra Fanshawe is the person,
under this roof, in whom you have long been interested--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) is the
magnet which attracts you to the Rue Fossette, that for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) sake you
venture into this garden, and seek out caskets dropped by rivals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>And now I paused. For the second time that night I was going beyond
myself--venturing out of what I looked on as my natural
habits--speaking in an unpremeditated, impulsive strain, which startled
me strangely when I halted to reflect. On rising that morning, had I
anticipated that before night I should have acted the part of a gay
lover in a vaudeville; and an hour after, frankly discussed with Dr.
John the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hapless suit, and rallied him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
illusions? I had no more presaged such feats than I had looked forward
to an ascent in a balloon, or a voyage to Cape Horn.

<p/>The Doctor and I, having paced down the walk, were now returning; the
reflex from the window again lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face: he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) smiled, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eye was
melancholy. How I wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) could feel heart's-ease! How I grieved
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) brooded over pain, and pain from such a cause! He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
great advantages, _he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)_ to love in vain! I did not then know that the
pensiveness of reverse is the best phase for some minds; nor did I
reflect that some herbs, <div class="bookquote">``though scentless when entire, yield fragrance
when they're bruised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be sorrowful, do not grieve,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I broke out. <div class="bookquote">``If there is in
Ginevra one spark of worthiness of your affection, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will--she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) _must_
feel devotion in return. Be cheerful, be hopeful, Dr. John. Who should
hope, if not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In return for this speech I got--what, it must be supposed, I
deserved--a look of surprise: I thought also of some disapprobation. We
parted, and I went into the house very chill. The clocks struck and the
bells tolled midnight; people were leaving fast: the fête was over; the
lamps were fading. In another hour all the dwelling-house, and all the
pensionnat, were dark and hushed. I too was in bed, but not asleep. To
me it was not easy to sleep after a day of such excitement.




<p/>CHAPTER XV.

<p/>THE LONG VACATION.


<p/>Following Madame Beck's fête, with its three preceding weeks of
relaxation, its brief twelve hours' burst of hilarity and dissipation,
and its one subsequent day of utter languor, came a period of reaction;
two months of real application, of close, hard study. These two months,
being the last of the <div class="bookquote">``année scolaire,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were indeed the only genuine
working months in the year. To them was procrastinated--into them
concentrated, alike by professors, mistresses, and pupils--the main
burden of preparation for the examinations preceding the distribution
of prizes. Candidates for rewards had then to work in good earnest;
masters and teachers had to set their shoulders to the wheel, to urge
on the backward, and diligently aid and train the more promising. A
showy demonstration--a telling exhibition--must be got up for public
view, and all means were fair to this end.

<p/>I scarcely noted how the other teachers went to work; I had my own
business to mind; and _my_ task was not the least onerous, being to
imbue some ninety sets of brains with a due tincture of what they
considered a most complicated and difficult science, that of the
English language; and to drill ninety tongues in what, for them, was an
almost impossible pronunciation--the lisping and hissing dentals of the
Isles.

<p/>The examination-day arrived. Awful day! Prepared for with anxious care,
dressed for with silent despatch--nothing vaporous or fluttering
now--no white gauze or azure streamers; the grave, close, compact was
the order of the toilette. It seemed to me that I was this day,
especially doomed--the main burden and trial falling on me alone of all
the female teachers. The others were not expected to examine in the
studies they taught; the professor of literature, M. Paul, taking upon
himself this duty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), this school autocrat, gathered all and sundry
reins into the hollow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) one hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) irefully rejected any
colleague; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not have help. Madame herself, who evidently rather
wished to undertake the examination in geography--her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) favourite study,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) taught well--was forced to succumb, and be subordinate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
despotic kinsman's direction. The whole staff of instructors, male and
female, he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) set aside, and stood on the examiner's estrade alone. It
irked him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) was forced to make one exception to this rule. He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>)
could not manage English: he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) was obliged to leave that branch of
education in the English teacher's hands; which he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) did, not without a
flash of naïve jealousy.

<p/>A constant crusade against the <div class="bookquote">``amour-propre''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>of every human being but
himself, was the crotchet of this able, but fiery and grasping little
man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a strong relish for public representation in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
person, but an extreme abhorrence of the like display in any other. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
quelled, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept down when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fumed
like a bottled storm.

<p/>On the evening preceding the examination-day, I was walking in the
garden, as were the other teachers and all the boarders. M. Emanuel
joined me in the <div class="bookquote">``allée défendue;''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) cigar was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lips; his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
paletôt--a most characteristic garment of no particular shape--hung
dark and menacing; the tassel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) bonnet grec sternly shadowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
left temple; his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) black whiskers curled like those of a wrathful cat;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) blue eye had a cloud in its glitter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ainsi,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) began, abruptly fronting and arresting me, <div class="bookquote">``vous allez
trôner comme une reine; demain--trôner à mes côtés? Sans doute vous
savourez d'avance les délices de l'autorité. Je crois voir en je ne
sais quoi de rayonnante, petite ambitieuse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Now the fact was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) happened to be entirely mistaken. I did not--could
not--estimate the admiration or the good opinion of tomorrow's audience
at the same rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) did. Had that audience numbered as many personal
friends and acquaintance for me as for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), I know not how it might
have been: I speak of the case as it stood. On me school-triumphs shed
but a cold lustre. I had wondered--and I wondered now--how it was that
for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) they seemed to shine as with hearth-warmth and hearth-glow.
_He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)_ cared for them perhaps too much; _I_, probably, too little.
However, I had my own fancies as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). I liked, for instance, to
see M. Emanuel jealous; it lit up his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) nature, and woke his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) spirit; it
threw all sorts of queer lights and shadows over his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) dun face, and into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) violet-azure eyes -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) used to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) black hair and blue eyes
were <div class="bookquote">``une de ses beautés'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-RRB-. There was a relish in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) anger; it was
artless, earnest, quite unreasonable, but never hypocritical. I uttered
no disclaimer then of the complacency he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) attributed to me; I merely
asked where the English examination came in--whether at the
commencement or close of the day?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hesitate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``whether at the very beginning, before many
persons are come, and when your aspiring nature will not be gratified
by a large audience, or quite at the close, when everybody is tired,
and only a jaded and worn-out attention will be at your service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Que vous êtes dur, Monsieur!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, affecting dejection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One ought to be `dur' with you. You are one of those beings who must
be _kept down_. I know you! I know you! Other people in this house see
you pass, and think that a colourless shadow has gone by. As for me, I
scrutinized your face once, and it sufficed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are satisfied that you understand me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Without answering directly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``Were you not gratified when
you succeeded in that vaudeville? I watched you and saw a passionate
ardour for triumph in your physiognomy. What fire shot into the glance!
Not mere light, but flame: je me tiens pour averti.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What feeling I had on that occasion, Monsieur--and pardon me, if I
say, you immensely exaggerate both its quality and quantity--was quite
abstract. I did not care for the vaudeville. I hated the part you
assigned me. I had not the slightest sympathy with the audience below
the stage. They are good people, doubtless, but do I know them? Are
they anything to me? Can I care for being brought before their view
again to-morrow? Will the examination be anything but a task to me--a
task I wish well over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I take it out of your hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart; if you do not fear failure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I should fail. I only know three phrases of English, and a few
words: par exemple, de sonn, de mone, de stares--est-ce bien dit? My
opinion is that it would be better to give up the thing altogether: to
have no English examination, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Madame consents, I consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heartily?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very heartily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) cigar in silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) turned suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Donnez-moi la main,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), and the spite and jealousy melted out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) face, and a generous kindliness shone there instead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, we will not be rivals, we will be friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) pursued. <div class="bookquote">``The
examination shall take place, and I will choose a good moment; and
instead of vexing and hindering, as I felt half-inclined ten minutes
ago--for I have my malevolent moods: I always had from childhood--I
will aid you sincerely. After all, you are solitary and a stranger, and
have your way to make and your bread to earn; it may be well that you
should become known. We will be friends: do you agree?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of my heart, Monsieur. I am glad of a friend. I like that better
than a triumph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pauvrette?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), and turned away and left the alley.

<p/>The examination passed over well; M. Paul was as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) word, and
did his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) best to make my part easy. The next day came the distribution
of prizes; that also passed; the school broke up; the pupils went home,
and now began the long vacation.

<p/>That vacation! Shall I ever forget it? I think not. Madame Beck went,
the first day of the holidays, to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) children at the sea-side;
all the three teachers had parents or friends with whom they took
refuge; every professor quitted the city; some went to Paris, some to
Boue-Marine; M. Paul set forth on a pilgrimage to Rome; the house was
left quite empty, but for me, a servant, and a poor deformed and
imbecile pupil, a sort of crétin, whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) stepmother in a distant
province would not allow to return home.

<p/>My heart almost died within me; miserable longings strained its chords.
How long were the September days! How silent, how lifeless! How vast
and void seemed the desolate premises! How gloomy the forsaken
garden--grey now with the dust of a town summer departed. Looking
forward at the commencement of those eight weeks, I hardly knew how I
was to live to the end. My spirits had long been gradually sinking; now
that the prop of employment was withdrawn, they went down fast. Even to
look forward was not to hope: the dumb future spoke no comfort, offered
no promise, gave no inducement to bear present evil in reliance on
future good. A sorrowful indifference to existence often pressed on
me--a despairing resignation to reach betimes the end of all things
earthly. Alas! When I had full leisure to look on life as life must be
looked on by such as me, I found it but a hopeless desert: tawny sands,
with no green fields, no palm-tree, no well in view. The hopes which
are dear to youth, which bear it up and lead it on, I knew not and
dared not know. If they knocked at my heart sometimes, an inhospitable
bar to admission must be inwardly drawn. When they turned away thus
rejected, tears sad enough sometimes flowed: but it could not be
helped: I dared not give such guests lodging. So mortally did I fear
the sin and weakness of presumption.

<p/>Religious reader, you will preach to me a long sermon about what I have
just written, and so will you, moralist: and you, stern sage: you,
stoic, will frown; you, cynic, sneer; you, epicure, laugh. Well, each
and all, take it your own way. I accept the sermon, frown, sneer, and
laugh; perhaps you are all right: and perhaps, circumstanced like me,
you would have been, like me, wrong. The first month was, indeed, a
long, black, heavy month to me.

<p/>The crétin did not seem unhappy. I did my best to feed her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) well and
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) warm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) only asked food and sunshine, or when that
lacked, fire. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) weak faculties approved of inertion: her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) brain, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ears, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heart slept content; they could not wake to work,
so lethargy was their Paradise.

<p/>Three weeks of that vacation were hot, fair, and dry, but the fourth
and fifth were tempestuous and wet. I do not know why that change in
the atmosphere made a cruel impression on me, why the raging storm and
beating rain crushed me with a deadlier paralysis than I had
experienced while the air had remained serene; but so it was; and my
nervous system could hardly support what it had for many days and
nights to undergo in that huge empty house. How I used to pray to
Heaven for consolation and support! With what dread force the
conviction would grasp me that Fate was my permanent foe, never to be
conciliated. I did not, in my heart, arraign the mercy or justice of
God for this; I concluded it to be a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) great plan that some
must deeply suffer while they live, and I thrilled in the certainty
that of this number, I was one.

<p/>It was some relief when an aunt of the crétin, a kind old woman, came
one day, and took away my strange, deformed companion. The hapless
creature had been at times a heavy charge; I could not take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out
beyond the garden, and I could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a minute alone: for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
poor mind, like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body, was warped: its propensity was to evil. A
vague bent to mischief, an aimless malevolence, made constant vigilance
indispensable. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) very rarely spoke, and would sit for hours
together moping and mowing, and distorting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features with
indescribable grimaces, it was more like being prisoned with some
strange tameless animal, than associating with a human being. Then
there were personal attentions to be rendered which required the nerve
of a hospital nurse; my resolution was so tried, it sometimes fell
dead-sick. These duties should not have fallen on me; a servant, now
absent, had rendered them hitherto, and in the hurry of holiday
departure, no substitute to fill this office had been provided. This
tax and trial were by no means the least I have known in life. Still,
menial and distasteful as they were, my mental pain was far more
wasting and wearing. Attendance on the crétin deprived me often of the
power and inclination to swallow a meal, and sent me faint to the fresh
air, and the well or fountain in the court; but this duty never wrung
my heart, or brimmed my eyes, or scalded my cheek with tears hot as
molten metal.

<p/>The crétin being gone, I was free to walk out. At first I lacked
courage to venture very far from the Rue Fossette, but by degrees I
sought the city gates, and passed them, and then went wandering away
far along chaussées, through fields, beyond cemeteries, Catholic and
Protestant, beyond farmsteads, to lanes and little woods, and I know
not where. A goad thrust me on, a fever forbade me to rest; a want of
companionship maintained in my soul the cravings of a most deadly
famine. I often walked all day, through the burning noon and the arid
afternoon, and the dusk evening, and came back with moonrise.

<p/>While wandering in solitude, I would sometimes picture the present
probable position of others, my acquaintance. There was Madame Beck at
a cheerful watering-place with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) children, her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) mother, and a whole
troop of friends who had sought the same scene of relaxation. Zélie St.
Pierre was at Paris, with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) relatives; the other teachers were at
their homes. There was Ginevra Fanshawe, whom certain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
connections had carried on a pleasant tour southward. Ginevra seemed to
me the happiest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) was on the route of beautiful scenery; these
September suns shone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) on fertile plains, where harvest and
vintage matured under their mellow beam. These gold and crystal moons
rose on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) vision over blue horizons waved in mounted lines.

<p/>But all this was nothing; I too felt those autumn suns and saw those
harvest moons, and I almost wished to be covered in with earth and
turf, deep out of their influence; for I could not live in their light,
nor make them comrades, nor yield them affection. But Ginevra had a
kind of spirit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>), empowered to give constant strength and
comfort, to gladden daylight and embalm darkness; the best of the good
genii that guard humanity curtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wings, and canopied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) head with his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) bending form. By True Love was Ginevra followed:
never could she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) be alone. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) insensible to this presence? It
seemed to me impossible: I could not realize such deadness. I imagined
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) grateful in secret, loving now with reserve; but purposing one day
to show how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) loved: I pictured her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) faithful hero half conscious
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) coy fondness, and comforted by that consciousness: I conceived
an electric chord of sympathy between them, a fine chain of mutual
understanding, sustaining union through a separation of a hundred
leagues--carrying, across mound and hollow, communication by prayer and
wish. Ginevra gradually became with me a sort of heroine. One day,
perceiving this growing illusion, I said, <div class="bookquote">``I really believe my nerves
are getting overstretched: my mind has suffered somewhat too much a
malady is growing upon it--what shall I do? How shall I keep well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Indeed there was no way to keep well under the circumstances. At last a
day and night of peculiarly agonizing depression were succeeded by
physical illness, I took perforce to my bed. About this time the Indian
summer closed and the equinoctial storms began; and for nine dark and
wet days, of which the hours rushed on all turbulent, deaf,
dishevelled--bewildered with sounding hurricane--I lay in a strange
fever of the nerves and blood. Sleep went quite away. I used to rise in
the night, look round for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), beseech her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) earnestly to return. A
rattle of the window, a cry of the blast only replied--Sleep never
came!

<p/>I err. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came once, but in anger. Impatient of my importunity she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) an avenging dream. By the clock of St. Jean Baptiste,
that dream remained scarce fifteen minutes--a brief space, but
sufficing to wring my whole frame with unknown anguish; to confer a
nameless experience that had the hue, the mien, the terror, the very
tone of a visitation from eternity. Between twelve and one that night a
cup was forced to my lips, black, strong, strange, drawn from no well,
but filled up seething from a bottomless and boundless sea. Suffering,
brewed in temporal or calculable measure, and mixed for mortal lips,
tastes not as this suffering tasted. Having drank and woke, I thought
all was over: the end come and past by. Trembling fearfully--as
consciousness returned--ready to cry out on some fellow-creature to
help me, only that I knew no fellow-creature was near enough to catch
the wild summons--Goton in her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow-creature</b></font>) far distant attic could not hear--I rose
on my knees in bed. Some fearful hours went over me: indescribably was
I torn, racked and oppressed in mind. Amidst the horrors of that dream
I think the worst lay here. Methought the well-loved dead, who had
loved _me_ well in life, met me elsewhere, alienated: galled was my
inmost spirit with an unutterable sense of despair about the future.
Motive there was none why I should try to recover or wish to live; and
yet quite unendurable was the pitiless and haughty voice in which Death
challenged me to engage his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) unknown terrors. When I tried to pray I
could only utter these words: <div class="bookquote">``From my youth up Thy terrors have I
suffered with a troubled mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Most true was it.

<p/>On bringing me my tea next morning Goton urged me to call in a doctor.
I would not: I thought no doctor could cure me.

<p/>One evening--and I was not delirious: I was in my sane mind, I got
up--I dressed myself, weak and shaking. The solitude and the stillness
of the long dormitory could not be borne any longer; the ghastly white
beds were turning into spectres--the coronal of each became a
death's-head, huge and sun-bleached--dead dreams of an elder world and
mightier race lay frozen in their wide gaping eyeholes. That evening
more firmly than ever fastened into my soul the conviction that Fate
was of stone, and Hope a false idol--blind, bloodless, and of granite
core. I felt, too, that the trial God had appointed me was gaining its
climax, and must now be turned by my own hands, hot, feeble, trembling
as they were. It rained still, and blew; but with more clemency, I
thought, than it had poured and raged all day. Twilight was falling,
and I deemed its influence pitiful; from the lattice I saw coming
night-clouds trailing low like banners drooping. It seemed to me that
at this hour there was affection and sorrow in Heaven above for all
pain suffered on earth beneath; the weight of my dreadful dream became
alleviated--that insufferable thought of being no more loved--no more
owned, half-yielded to hope of the contrary--I was sure this hope would
shine clearer if I got out from under this house-roof, which was
crushing as the slab of a tomb, and went outside the city to a certain
quiet hill, a long way distant in the fields. Covered with a cloak -LRB-I
could not be delirious, for I had sense and recollection to put on warm
clothing-RRB-, forth I set. The bells of a church arrested me in passing;
they seemed to call me in to the _salut_, and I went in. Any solemn
rite, any spectacle of sincere worship, any opening for appeal to God
was as welcome to me then as bread to one in extremity of want. I knelt
down with others on the stone pavement. It was an old solemn church,
its pervading gloom not gilded but purpled by light shed through
stained glass.

<p/>Few worshippers were assembled, and, the _salut_ over, half of them
departed. I discovered soon that those left remained to confess. I did
not stir. Carefully every door of the church was shut; a holy quiet
sank upon, and a solemn shade gathered about us. After a space,
breathless and spent in prayer, a penitent approached the confessional.
I watched. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) avowal; her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) shrift was whispered back; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
returned consoled. Another went, and another. A pale lady, kneeling
near me, said in a low, kind voice:--<div class="bookquote">``Go you now, I am not quite
prepared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Mechanically obedient, I rose and went. I knew what I was about; my
mind had run over the intent with lightning-speed. To take this step
could not make me more wretched than I was; it might soothe me.

<p/>The priest within the confessional never turned his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) eyes to regard me;
he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) only quietly inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) ear to my lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) might be a good man,
but this duty had become to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) a sort of form: he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) went through it with
the phlegm of custom. I hesitated; of the formula of confession I was
ignorant: instead of commencing, then, with the prelude usual, I
said:--<div class="bookquote">``Mon père, je suis Protestante.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) directly turned. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was not a native priest: of that class, the cast
of physiognomy is, almost invariably, grovelling: I saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) profile
and brow he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was a Frenchman; though grey and advanced in years, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) did
not, I think, lack feeling or intelligence. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) inquired, not unkindly,
why, being a Protestant, I came to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)?

<p/>I said I was perishing for a word of advice or an accent of comfort. I
had been living for some weeks quite alone; I had been ill; I had a
pressure of affliction on my mind of which it would hardly any longer
endure the weight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it a sin, a crime?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) inquired, somewhat startled. I reassured
him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) on this point, and, as well as I could, I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) the mere
outline of my experience.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) looked thoughtful, surprised, puzzled. <div class="bookquote">``You take me unawares,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have not had such a case as yours before: ordinarily we know our
routine, and are prepared; but this makes a great break in the common
course of confession. I am hardly furnished with counsel fitting the
circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course, I had not expected he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would be; but the mere relief of
communication in an ear which was human and sentient, yet
consecrated--the mere pouring out of some portion of long accumulating,
long pent-up pain into a vessel whence it could not be again
diffused--had done me good. I was already solaced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I go, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) sat silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) said kindly--and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was a kind man: he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had
a compassionate eye--<div class="bookquote">``for the present you had better go: but I assure
you your words have struck me. Confession, like other things, is apt to
become formal and trivial with habit. You have come and poured your
heart out; a thing seldom done. I would fain think your case over, and
take it with me to my oratory. Were you of our faith I should know what
to say--a mind so tossed can find repose but in the bosom of retreat,
and the punctual practice of piety. The world, it is well known, has no
satisfaction for that class of natures. Holy men have bidden penitents
like you to hasten their path upward by penance, self-denial, and
difficult good works. Tears are given them here for meat and
drink--bread of affliction and waters of affliction--their recompence
comes hereafter. It is my own conviction that these impressions under
which you are smarting are messengers from God to bring you back to the
true Church. You were made for our faith: depend upon it our faith
alone could heal and help you--Protestantism is altogether too dry,
cold, prosaic for you. The further I look into this matter, the more
plainly I see it is entirely out of the common order of things. On no
account would I lose sight of you. Go, my daughter, for the present;
but return to me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I rose and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>). I was withdrawing when he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) signed me to return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not come to this church,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I see you are ill, and
this church is too cold; you must come to my house: I live--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) address-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Be there to-morrow morning at ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In reply to this appointment, I only bowed; and pulling down my veil,
and gathering round me my cloak, I glided away.

<p/>Did I, do you suppose, reader, contemplate venturing again within that
worthy priest's reach? As soon should I have thought of walking into a
Babylonish furnace. That priest had arms which could influence me: he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
was naturally kind, with a sentimental French kindness, to whose
softness I knew myself not wholly impervious. Without respecting some
sorts of affection, there was hardly any sort having a fibre of root in
reality, which I could rely on my force wholly to withstand. Had I gone
to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would have shown me all that was tender, and comforting, and
gentle, in the honest Popish superstition. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would have tried to
kindle, blow and stir up in me the zeal of good works. I know not how
it would all have ended. We all think ourselves strong in some points;
we all know ourselves weak in many; the probabilities are that had I
visited Numero 10, Rue des Mages, at the hour and day appointed, I
might just now, instead of writing this heretic narrative, be counting
my beads in the cell of a certain Carmelite convent on the Boulevard of
Crécy, in Villette. There was something of Fénélon about that benign
old priest; and whatever most of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) brethren may be, and whatever I
may think of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) Church and creed -LRB-and I like neither-RRB-, of himself I
must ever retain a grateful recollection. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was kind when I needed
kindness; he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) did me good. May Heaven bless him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)!

<p/>Twilight had passed into night, and the lamps were lit in the streets
ere I issued from that sombre church. To turn back was now become
possible to me; the wild longing to breathe this October wind on the
little hill far without the city walls had ceased to be an imperative
impulse, and was softened into a wish with which Reason could cope: she (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
put it down, and I turned, as I thought, to the Rue Fossette. But I had
become involved in a part of the city with which I was not familiar; it
was the old part, and full of narrow streets of picturesque, ancient,
and mouldering houses. I was much too weak to be very collected, and I
was still too careless of my own welfare and safety to be cautious; I
grew embarrassed; I got immeshed in a network of turns unknown. I was
lost and had no resolution to ask guidance of any passenger.

<p/>If the storm had lulled a little at sunset, it made up now for lost
time. Strong and horizontal thundered the current of the wind from
north-west to south-east; it brought rain like spray, and sometimes a
sharp hail, like shot: it was cold and pierced me to the vitals. I bent
my head to meet it, but it beat me back. My heart did not fail at all
in this conflict; I only wished that I had wings and could ascend the
gale, spread and repose my pinions on its strength, career in its
course, sweep where it swept. While wishing this, I suddenly felt
colder where before I was cold, and more powerless where before I was
weak. I tried to reach the porch of a great building near, but the mass
of frontage and the giant spire turned black and vanished from my eyes.
Instead of sinking on the steps as I intended, I seemed to pitch
headlong down an abyss. I remember no more.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI.

<p/>AULD LANG SYNE.


<p/>Where my soul went during that swoon I cannot tell. Whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw,
or wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) travelled in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) trance on that strange night she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own secret; never whispering a word to Memory, and baffling
imagination by an indissoluble silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) may have gone upward, and
come in sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eternal home, hoping for leave to rest now, and
deeming that her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) painful union with matter was at last dissolved. While
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so deemed, an angel may have warned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away from heaven's
threshold, and, guiding her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) weeping down, have bound her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), once more,
all shuddering and unwilling, to that poor frame, cold and wasted, of
whose companionship she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was grown more than weary.

<p/>I know she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) re-entered her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) prison with pain, with reluctance, with a
moan and a long shiver. The divorced mates, Spirit and Substance, were
hard to re-unite: they greeted each other, not in an embrace, but a
racking sort of struggle. The returning sense of sight came upon me,
red, as if it swam in blood; suspended hearing rushed back loud, like
thunder; consciousness revived in fear: I sat up appalled, wondering
into what region, amongst what strange beings I was waking. At first I
knew nothing I looked on: a wall was not a wall--a lamp not a lamp. I
should have understood what we call a ghost, as well as I did the
commonest object: which is another way of intimating that all my eye
rested on struck it as spectral. But the faculties soon settled each in
his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) place; the life-machine presently resumed its wonted and regular
working.

<p/>Still, I knew not where I was; only in time I saw I had been removed
from the spot where I fell: I lay on no portico-step; night and tempest
were excluded by walls, windows, and ceiling. Into some house I had
been carried--but what house?

<p/>I could only think of the pensionnat in the Rue Fossette. Still
half-dreaming, I tried hard to discover in what room they had put me;
whether the great dormitory, or one of the little dormitories. I was
puzzled, because I could not make the glimpses of furniture I saw
accord with my knowledge of any of these apartments. The empty white
beds were wanting, and the long line of large windows. <div class="bookquote">``Surely,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I, <div class="bookquote">``it is not to Madame Beck's own chamber they have carried
me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And here my eye fell on an easy-chair covered with blue damask.
Other seats, cushioned to match, dawned on me by degrees; and at last I
took in the complete fact of a pleasant parlour, with a wood fire on a
clear-shining hearth, a carpet where arabesques of bright blue relieved
a ground of shaded fawn; pale walls over which a slight but endless
garland of azure forget-me-nots ran mazed and bewildered amongst myriad
gold leaves and tendrils. A gilded mirror filled up the space between
two windows, curtained amply with blue damask. In this mirror I saw
myself laid, not in bed, but on a sofa. I looked spectral; my eyes
larger and more hollow, my hair darker than was natural, by contrast
with my thin and ashen face. It was obvious, not only from the
furniture, but from the position of windows, doors, and fireplace, that
this was an unknown room in an unknown house.

<p/>Hardly less plain was it that my brain was not yet settled; for, as I
gazed at the blue arm-chair, it appeared to grow familiar; so did a
certain scroll-couch, and not less so the round centre-table, with a
blue-covering, bordered with autumn-tinted foliage; and, above all, two
little footstools with worked covers, and a small ebony-framed chair,
of which the seat and back were also worked with groups of brilliant
flowers on a dark ground.

<p/>Struck with these things, I explored further. Strange to say, old
acquaintance were all about me, and <div class="bookquote">``auld lang syne''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>smiled out of
every nook. There were two oval miniatures over the mantel-piece, of
which I knew by heart the pearls about the high and powdered <div class="bookquote">``heads;''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the velvets circling the white throats; the swell of the full muslin
kerchiefs: the pattern of the lace sleeve-ruffles. Upon the
mantel-shelf there were two china vases, some relics of a diminutive
tea-service, as smooth as enamel and as thin as egg-shell, and a white
centre ornament, a classic group in alabaster, preserved under glass.
Of all these things I could have told the peculiarities, numbered the
flaws or cracks, like any _clairvoyante_. Above all, there was a pair
of handscreens, with elaborate pencil-drawings finished like line
engravings; these, my very eyes ached at beholding again, recalling
hours when they had followed, stroke by stroke and touch by touch, a
tedious, feeble, finical, school-girl pencil held in these fingers, now
so skeleton-like.

<p/>Where was I? Not only in what spot of the world, but in what year of
our Lord? For all these objects were of past days, and of a distant
country. Ten years ago I bade them good-by; since my fourteenth year
they and I had never met. I gasped audibly, <div class="bookquote">``Where am I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>A shape hitherto unnoticed, stirred, rose, came forward: a shape
inharmonious with the environment, serving only to complicate the
riddle further. This was no more than a sort of native bonne, in a
common-place bonne's cap and print-dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke neither French nor
English, and I could get no intelligence from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), not understanding
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) phrases of dialect. But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bathed my temples and forehead with
some cool and perfumed water, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heightened the cushion on
which I reclined, made signs that I was not to speak, and resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
post at the foot of the sofa.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was busy knitting; her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes thus drawn from me, I could gaze on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
without interruption. I did mightily wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came there, or what
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could have to do among the scenes, or with the days of my girlhood.
Still more I marvelled what those scenes and days could now have to do
with me.

<p/>Too weak to scrutinize thoroughly the mystery, I tried to settle it by
saying it was a mistake, a dream, a fever-fit; and yet I knew there
could be no mistake, and that I was not sleeping, and I believed I was
sane. I wished the room had not been so well lighted, that I might not
so clearly have seen the little pictures, the ornaments, the screens,
the worked chair. All these objects, as well as the blue-damask
furniture, were, in fact, precisely the same, in every minutest detail,
with those I so well remembered, and with which I had been so
thoroughly intimate, in the drawing-room of my godmother's house at
Bretton. Methought the apartment only was changed, being of different
proportions and dimensions.

<p/>I thought of Bedreddin Hassan, transported in his (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) sleep from Cairo to
the gates of Damascus. Had a Genius stooped his (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) dark wing down the
storm to whose stress I had succumbed, and gathering me from the
church-steps, and <div class="bookquote">``rising high into the air,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>as the eastern tale said,
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) borne me over land and ocean, and laid me quietly down beside a
hearth of Old England? But no; I knew the fire of that hearth burned
before its Lares no more--it went out long ago, and the household gods
had been carried elsewhere.

<p/>The bonne turned again to survey me, and seeing my eyes wide open, and,
I suppose, deeming their expression perturbed and excited, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) put down
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) knitting. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) busied for a moment at a little stand; she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
poured out water, and measured drops from a phial: glass in hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
approached me. What dark-tinged draught might she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) now be offering? what
Genii-elixir or Magi-distillation?

<p/>It was too late to inquire--I had swallowed it passively, and at once.
A tide of quiet thought now came gently caressing my brain; softer and
softer rose the flow, with tepid undulations smoother than balm. The
pain of weakness left my limbs, my muscles slept. I lost power to move;
but, losing at the same time wish, it was no privation. That kind bonne
placed a screen between me and the lamp; I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) rise to do this, but
do not remember seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) resume her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) place: in the interval between
the two acts, I <div class="bookquote">``fell on sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>At waking, lo! all was again changed. The light of high day surrounded
me; not, indeed, a warm, summer light, but the leaden gloom of raw and
blustering autumn. I felt sure now that I was in the pensionnat--sure
by the beating rain on the casement; sure by the <div class="bookquote">``wuther''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>of wind
amongst trees, denoting a garden outside; sure by the chill, the
whiteness, the solitude, amidst which I lay. I say _whiteness_--for the
dimity curtains, dropped before a French bed, bounded my view.

<p/>I lifted them; I looked out. My eye, prepared to take in the range of a
long, large, and whitewashed chamber, blinked baffled, on encountering
the limited area of a small cabinet--a cabinet with seagreen walls;
also, instead of five wide and naked windows, there was one high
lattice, shaded with muslin festoons: instead of two dozen little
stands of painted wood, each holding a basin and an ewer, there was a
toilette-table dressed, like a lady for a ball, in a white robe over a
pink skirt; a polished and large glass crowned, and a pretty
pin-cushion frilled with lace, adorned it. This toilette, together with
a small, low, green and white chintz arm-chair, a washstand topped with
a marble slab, and supplied with utensils of pale greenware,
sufficiently furnished the tiny chamber.

<p/>Reader; I felt alarmed! Why? you will ask. What was there in this
simple and somewhat pretty sleeping-closet to startle the most timid?
Merely this--These articles of furniture could not be real, solid
arm-chairs, looking-glasses, and washstands--they must be the ghosts of
such articles; or, if this were denied as too wild an hypothesis--and,
confounded as I was, I _did_ deny it--there remained but to conclude
that I had myself passed into an abnormal state of mind; in short, that
I was very ill and delirious: and even then, mine was the strangest
figment with which delirium had ever harassed a victim.

<p/>I knew--I was obliged to know--the green chintz of that little chair;
the little snug chair itself, the carved, shining-black, foliated frame
of that glass; the smooth, milky-green of the china vessels on the
stand; the very stand too, with its top of grey marble, splintered at
one corner;--all these I was compelled to recognise and to hail, as
last night I had, perforce, recognised and hailed the rosewood, the
drapery, the porcelain, of the drawing-room.

<p/>Bretton! Bretton! and ten years ago shone reflected in that mirror. And
why did Bretton and my fourteenth year haunt me thus? Why, if they came
at all, did they not return complete? Why hovered before my distempered
vision the mere furniture, while the rooms and the locality were gone?
As to that pincushion made of crimson satin, ornamented with gold beads
and frilled with thread-lace, I had the same right to know it as to
know the screens--I had made it myself. Rising with a start from the
bed, I took the cushion in my hand and examined it. There was the
cipher <div class="bookquote">``L. L. B.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>formed in gold beds, and surrounded with an oval
wreath embroidered in white silk. These were the initials of my
godmother's name--Lonisa Lucy Bretton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I in England? Am I at Bretton?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered; and hastily pulling up
the blind with which the lattice was shrouded, I looked out to try and
discover _where_ I was; half-prepared to meet the calm, old, handsome
buildings and clean grey pavement of St. Ann's Street, and to see at
the end the towers of the minster: or, if otherwise, fully expectant of
a town view somewhere, a rue in Villette, if not a street in a pleasant
and ancient English city.

<p/>I looked, on the contrary, through a frame of leafage, clustering round
the high lattice, and forth thence to a grassy mead-like level, a
lawn-terrace with trees rising from the lower ground beyond--high
forest-trees, such as I had not seen for many a day. They were now
groaning under the gale of October, and between their trunks I traced
the line of an avenue, where yellow leaves lay in heaps and drifts, or
were whirled singly before the sweeping west wind. Whatever landscape
might lie further must have been flat, and these tall beeches shut it
out. The place seemed secluded, and was to me quite strange: I did not
know it at all.

<p/>Once more I lay down. My bed stood in a little alcove; on turning my
face to the wall, the room with its bewildering accompaniments became
excluded. Excluded? No! For as I arranged my position in this hope,
behold, on the green space between the divided and looped-up curtains,
hung a broad, gilded picture-frame enclosing a portrait. It was
drawn--well drawn, though but a sketch--in water-colours; a head, a
boy's head, fresh, life-like, speaking, and animated. It seemed a youth
of sixteen, fair-complexioned, with sanguine health in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cheek; hair
long, not dark, and with a sunny sheen; penetrating eyes, an arch
mouth, and a gay smile. On the whole a most pleasant face to look at,
especially for, those claiming a right to that youth's
affections--parents, for instance, or sisters. Any romantic little
school-girl might almost have loved it in its frame. Those eyes looked
as if when somewhat older they would flash a lightning-response to
love: I cannot tell whether they kept in store the steady-beaming shine
of faith. For whatever sentiment met him (<font color='blue'><b>school-girl</b></font>) in form too facile, his (<font color='blue'><b>school-girl</b></font>) lips
menaced, beautifully but surely, caprice and light esteem.

<p/>Striving to take each new discovery as quietly as I could, I whispered
to myself--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that portrait used to hang in the breakfast-room, over the
mantel-piece: somewhat too high, as I thought. I well remember how I
used to mount a music-stool for the purpose of unhooking it, holding it
in my hand, and searching into those bonny wells of eyes, whose glance
under their hazel lashes seemed like a pencilled laugh; and well I
liked to note the colouring of the cheek, and the expression of the
mouth.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hardly believed fancy could improve on the curve of that
mouth, or of the chin; even _my_ ignorance knew that both were
beautiful, and pondered perplexed over this doubt: <div class="bookquote">``How it was that
what charmed so much, could at the same time so keenly pain?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Once, by
way of test, I took little Missy Home, and, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) in my arms,
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) to look at the picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like it, Polly?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) never answered, but gazed long,
and at last a darkness went trembling through her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) sensitive eye, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``Put me down.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So I put her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) down, saying to myself: <div class="bookquote">``The child
feels it too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>All these things do I now think over, adding, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) faults, yet
scarce ever was a finer nature; liberal, suave, impressible.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My
reflections closed in an audibly pronounced word, <div class="bookquote">``Graham!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Graham!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>echoed a sudden voice at the bedside. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want Graham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked. The plot was but thickening; the wonder but culminating. If
it was strange to see that well-remembered pictured form on the wall,
still stranger was it to turn and behold the equally well-remembered
living form opposite--a woman, a lady, most real and substantial, tall,
well-attired, wearing widow's silk, and such a cap as best became her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
matron and motherly braids of hair. Hers, too, was a good face; too
marked, perhaps, now for beauty, but not for sense or character. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
was little changed; something sterner, something more robust--but she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
was my godmother: still the distinct vision of Mrs. Bretton.

<p/>I kept quiet, yet internally _I_ was much agitated: my pulse fluttered,
and the blood left my cheek, which turned cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam, where am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a very safe asylum; well protected for the present; make your mind
quite easy till you get a little better; you look ill this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so entirely bewildered, I do not know whether I can trust my
senses at all, or whether they are misleading me in every particular:
but you speak English, do you not, madam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think you might hear that: it would puzzle me to hold a long
discourse in French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not come from England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am lately arrived thence. Have you been long in this country? You
seem to know my son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do, I, madam? Perhaps I do. Your son--the picture there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) portrait as a youth. While looking at it, you pronounced
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Graham Bretton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak to Mrs. Bretton, formerly of Bretton, --shire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right; and you, I am told, are an English teacher in a foreign
school here: my son recognised you as such.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was I found, madam, and by whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My son shall tell you that by-and-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but at present you
are too confused and weak for conversation: try to eat some breakfast,
and then sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Notwithstanding all I had undergone--the bodily fatigue, the
perturbation of spirits, the exposure to weather--it seemed that I was
better: the fever, the real malady which had oppressed my frame, was
abating; for, whereas during the last nine days I had taken no solid
food, and suffered from continual thirst, this morning, on breakfast
being offered, I experienced a craving for nourishment: an inward
faintness which caused me eagerly to taste the tea this lady offered,
and to eat the morsel of dry toast she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) allowed in accompaniment. It was
only a morsel, but it sufficed; keeping up my strength till some two or
three hours afterwards, when the bonne brought me a little cup of broth
and a biscuit.

<p/>As evening began to darken, and the ceaseless blast still blew wild and
cold, and the rain streamed on, deluge-like, I grew weary--very weary
of my bed. The room, though pretty, was small: I felt it confining: I
longed for a change. The increasing chill and gathering gloom, too,
depressed me; I wanted to see--to feel firelight. Besides, I kept
thinking of the son of that tall matron: when should I see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?
Certainly not till I left my room.

<p/>At last the bonne came to make my bed for the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) prepared to
wrap me in a blanket and place me in the little chintz chair; but,
declining these attentions, I proceeded to dress myself:

<p/>The business was just achieved, and I was sitting down to take breath,
when Mrs. Bretton once more appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dressed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) exclaimed, smiling with that smile I so well knew--a
pleasant smile, though not soft. <div class="bookquote">``You are quite better then? Quite
strong--eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) spoke to me so much as of old she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) used to speak that I almost
fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was beginning to know me. There was the same sort of
patronage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) voice and manner that, as a girl, I had always
experienced from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)--a patronage I yielded to and even liked; it was
not founded on conventional grounds of superior wealth or station -LRB-in
the last particular there had never been any inequality; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) degree was
mine-RRB-; but on natural reasons of physical advantage: it was the shelter
the tree gives the herb. I put a request without further ceremony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do let me go down-stairs, madam; I am so cold and dull here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I desire nothing better, if you are strong enough to bear the change,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) reply. <div class="bookquote">``Come then; here is an arm.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) offered me hers: I
took it, and we descended one flight of carpeted steps to a landing
where a tall door, standing open, gave admission into the blue-damask
room. How pleasant it was in its air of perfect domestic comfort! How
warm in its amber lamp-light and vermilion fire-flush! To render the
picture perfect, tea stood ready on the table--an English tea, whereof
the whole shining service glanced at me familiarly; from the solid
silver urn, of antique pattern, and the massive pot of the same metal,
to the thin porcelain cups, dark with purple and gilding. I knew the
very seed-cake of peculiar form, baked in a peculiar mould, which
always had a place on the tea-table at Bretton. Graham liked it, and
there it was as of yore--set before Graham's plate with the silver
knife and fork beside it. Graham was then expected to tea: Graham was
now, perhaps, in the house; ere many minutes I might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down--sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said my conductress, as my step faltered a little
in passing to the hearth. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seated me on the sofa, but I soon passed
behind it, saying the fire was too hot; in its shade I found another
seat which suited me better. Mrs. Bretton was never wont to make a fuss
about any person or anything; without remonstrance she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) suffered me to
have my own way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) made the tea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) took up the newspaper. I
liked to watch every action of my godmother; all her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) movements were so
young: she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) must have been now above fifty, yet neither her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) sinews nor
her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) spirit seemed yet touched by the rust of age. Though portly, she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
was alert, and though serene, she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was at times impetuous--good health
and an excellent temperament kept her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) green as in her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) spring.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) read, I perceived she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) listened--listened for her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was
not the woman ever to confess herself uneasy, but there was yet no lull
in the weather, and if Graham were out in that hoarse wind--roaring
still unsatisfied--I well knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother's heart would be out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes behind his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) watch; then, in
another minute, a lifting of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes from the page, and a slight
inclination of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head towards the door, denoted that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard some
sound. Presently her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brow cleared; and then even my ear, less
practised, caught the iron clash of a gate swung to, steps on gravel,
lastly the door-bell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was come. His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother filled the teapot from
the urn, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) drew nearer the hearth the stuffed and cushioned blue
chair--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own chair by right, but I saw there was one who might with
impunity usurp it. And when that _one_ came up the stairs--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
soon did, after, I suppose, some such attention to the toilet as the
wild and wet night rendered necessary, and strode straight in--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it you, Graham?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother, hiding a glad smile and speaking
curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who else should it be, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>demanded the Unpunctual, possessing
himself irreverently of the abdicated throne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you deserve cold tea, for being late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not get my deserts, for the urn sings cheerily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wheel yourself to the table, lazy boy: no seat will serve you but
mine; if you had one spark of a sense of propriety, you would always
leave that chair for the Old Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I should; only the dear Old Lady persists in leaving it for me. How
is your patient, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) come forward and speak for herself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bretton,
turning to my corner; and at this invitation, forward I came. Graham
courteously rose up to greet me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) stood tall on the hearth, a figure
justifying his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother's unconcealed pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you must be better then--much better.
I scarcely expected we should meet thus, or here. I was alarmed last
night, and if I had not been forced to hurry away to a dying patient, I
certainly would not have left you; but my mother herself is something
of a doctress, and Martha an excellent nurse. I saw the case was a
fainting-fit, not necessarily dangerous. What brought it on, I have yet
to learn, and all particulars; meantime, I trust you really do feel
better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said calmly. <div class="bookquote">``Much better, I thank you, Dr. John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>reader</b></font>)</div><p/>For, reader, this tall young man--this darling son--this host of
mine--this Graham Bretton, _was_ Dr. John: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and no other; and, what
is more, I ascertained this identity scarcely with surprise. What is
more, when I heard Graham's step on the stairs, I knew what manner of
figure would enter, and for whose aspect to prepare my eyes. The
discovery was not of to-day, its dawn had penetrated my perceptions
long since. Of course I remembered young Bretton well; and though ten
years -LRB-from sixteen to twenty-six-RRB- may greatly change the boy as they
mature him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to the man, yet they could bring no such utter difference as
would suffice wholly to blind my eyes, or baffle my memory. Dr. John
Graham Bretton retained still an affinity to the youth of sixteen: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) features; to wit, all the
excellently-moulded lower half of the face; I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) out soon. I
first recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) on that occasion, noted several chapters back,
when my unguardedly-fixed attention had drawn on me the mortification
of an implied rebuke. Subsequent observation confirmed, in every point,
that early surmise. I traced in the gesture, the port, and the habits
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) manhood, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) boy's promise. I heard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) now deep tones
the accent of former days. Certain turns of phrase, peculiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) of
old, were peculiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) still; and so was many a trick of eye and
lip, many a smile, many a sudden ray levelled from the irid, under his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
well-charactered brow.

<p/>To _say_ anything on the subject, to _hint_ at my discovery, had not
suited my habits of thought, or assimilated with my system of feeling.
On the contrary, I had preferred to keep the matter to myself. I liked
entering his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) presence covered with a cloud he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had not seen through,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) stood before me under a ray of special illumination which
shone all partial over his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) head, trembled about his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) feet, and cast
light no farther.

<p/>Well I knew that to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) it could make little difference, were I to come
forward and announce, <div class="bookquote">``This is Lucy Snowe!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So I kept back in my
teacher's place; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) never asked my name, so I never gave it. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
heard me called <div class="bookquote">``Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Miss Lucy;''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) never heard the surname,
<div class="bookquote">``Snowe.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As to spontaneous recognition--though I, perhaps, was still
less changed than he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)--the idea never approached his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) mind, and why
should I suggest it?

<p/>During tea, Dr. John was kind, as it was his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nature to be; that meal
over, and the tray carried out, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made a cosy arrangement of the
cushions in a corner of the sofa, and obliged me to settle amongst
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother also drew to the fire, and ere we had sat ten
minutes, I caught the eye of the latter fastened steadily upon me.
Women are certainly quicker in some things than men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed, presently, <div class="bookquote">``I have seldom seen a stronger
likeness! Graham, have you observed it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Observed what? What ails the Old Lady now? How you stare, mamma! One
would think you had an attack of second sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Graham, of whom does that young lady remind you?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>pointing to
me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, you put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) out of countenance. I often tell you abruptness is
your fault; remember, too, that to you she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a stranger, and does not
know your ways.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looks down; now, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turns sideways, who is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
like, Graham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, mamma, since you propound the riddle, I think you ought to
solve it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have known her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) some time, you say--ever since you first began
to attend the school in the Rue Fossette:--yet you never mentioned to
me that singular resemblance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not mention a thing of which I never thought, and which I do
not now acknowledge. What _can_ you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stupid boy! look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>Graham did look: but this was not to be endured; I saw how it must end,
so I thought it best to anticipate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. John,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``has had so much to do and think of, since he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and I
shook hands at our last parting in St. Ann's Street, that, while I
readily found out Mr. Graham Bretton, some months ago, it never
occurred to me as possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) should recognise Lucy Snowe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy Snowe! I thought so! I knew it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Bretton. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) at
once stepped across the hearth and kissed me. Some ladies would,
perhaps, have made a great bustle upon such a discovery without being
particularly glad of it; but it was not my godmother's habit to make a
bustle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) preferred all sentimental demonstrations in bas-relief.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) and I got over the surprise with few words and a single salute;
yet I daresay she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was pleased, and I know I was. While we renewed old
acquaintance, Graham, sitting opposite, silently disposed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
paroxysm of astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma calls me a stupid boy, and I think I am so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``for, upon my honour, often as I have seen you, I never once suspected
this fact: and yet I perceive it all now. Lucy Snowe! To be sure! I
recollect her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) perfectly, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) sits; not a doubt of it. But,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``you surely have not known me as an old acquaintance all this
time, and never mentioned it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>was my answer.

<p/>Dr. John commented not. I supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) regarded my silence as eccentric,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was indulgent in refraining from censure. I daresay, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
would have deemed it impertinent to have interrogated me very closely,
to have asked me the why and wherefore of my reserve; and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
might feel a little curious, the importance of the case was by no means
such as to tempt curiosity to infringe on discretion.

<p/>For my part, I just ventured to inquire whether he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) remembered the
circumstance of my once looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) very fixedly; for the slight
annoyance he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had betrayed on that occasion still lingered sore on my
mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I think I was even cross with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You considered me a little bold; perhaps?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Only, shy and retiring as your general manner was, I
wondered what personal or facial enormity in me proved so magnetic to
your usually averted eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see how it was now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>And here Mrs. Bretton broke in with many, many questions about past
times; and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) satisfaction I had to recur to gone-by troubles, to
explain causes of seeming estrangement, to touch on single-handed
conflict with Life, with Death, with Grief, with Fate. Dr. John
listened, saying little. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) then told me of changes they had
known: even with them all had not gone smoothly, and fortune had
retrenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) once abundant gifts. But so courageous a mother, with
such a champion in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, was well fitted to fight a good fight with
the world, and to prevail ultimately. Dr. John himself was one of those
on whose birth benign planets have certainly smiled. Adversity might
set against him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) most sullen front: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was the man to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) down
with smiles. Strong and cheerful, and firm and courteous; not rash, yet
valiant; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was the aspirant to woo Destiny herself, and to win from
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stone eyeballs a beam almost loving.

<p/>In the profession he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had adopted, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) success was now quite decided.
Within the last three months he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had taken this house -LRB-a small château,
they told me, about half a league without the Porte de Crécy-RRB-; this
country site being chosen for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother's health, with
which town air did not now agree. Hither he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had invited Mrs. Bretton,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), on leaving England, had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) such residue
furniture of the former St. Ann's Street mansion as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had thought fit
to keep unsold. Hence my bewilderment at the phantoms of chairs, and
the wraiths of looking-glasses, tea-urns, and teacups.

<p/>As the clock struck eleven, Dr. John stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe must retire now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is beginning to look very
pale. To-morrow I will venture to put some questions respecting the
cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) loss of health. She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is much changed, indeed, since last
July, when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) enact with no little spirit the part of a very
killing fine gentleman. As to last night's catastrophe, I am sure
thereby hangs a tale, but we will inquire no further this evening.
Good-night, Miss Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) kindly led me to the door, and holding a wax-candle, lighted
me up the one flight of stairs.

<p/>When I had said my prayers, and when I was undressed and laid down, I
felt that I still had friends. Friends, not professing vehement
attachment, not offering the tender solace of well-matched and
congenial relationship; on whom, therefore, but moderate demand of
affection was to be made, of whom but moderate expectation formed; but
towards whom my heart softened instinctively, and yearned with an
importunate gratitude, which I entreated Reason betimes to check.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not let me think of them too often, too much, too fondly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
implored: <div class="bookquote">``let me be content with a temperate draught of this living
stream: let me not run athirst, and apply passionately to its welcome
waters: let me not imagine in them a sweeter taste than earth's
fountains know. Oh! would to God I may be enabled to feel enough
sustained by an occasional, amicable intercourse, rare, brief,
unengrossing and tranquil: quite tranquil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Still repeating this word, I turned to my pillow; and _still_ repeating
it, I steeped that pillow with tears.




<p/>CHAPTER XVII.

<p/>LA TERRASSE.


<p/>These struggles with the natural character, the strong native bent of
the heart, may seem futile and fruitless, but in the end they do good.
They tend, however slightly, to give the actions, the conduct, that
turn which Reason approves, and which Feeling, perhaps, too often
opposes: they certainly make a difference in the general tenour of a
life, and enable it to be better regulated, more equable, quieter on
the surface; and it is on the surface only the common gaze will fall.
As to what lies below, leave that with God. Man, your equal, weak as
you, and not fit to be your judge, may be shut out thence: take it to
your Maker--show Him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) the secrets of the spirit He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) gave--ask Him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) how you
are to bear the pains He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) has appointed--kneel in His (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) presence, and pray
with faith for light in darkness, for strength in piteous weakness, for
patience in extreme need. Certainly, at some hour, though perhaps not
_your_ hour, the waiting waters will stir; in _some_ shape, though
perhaps not the shape you dreamed, which your heart loved, and for
which it bled, the healing herald will descend, the cripple and the
blind, and the dumb, and the possessed will be led to bathe. Herald,
come quickly! Thousands lie round the pool, weeping and despairing, to
see it, through slow years, stagnant. Long are the <div class="bookquote">``times''  (<font color='red'><b>Long</b></font>)</div>of Heaven:
the orbits of angel messengers seem wide to mortal vision; they may
enring ages: the cycle of one departure and return may clasp unnumbered
generations; and dust, kindling to brief suffering life, and through
pain, passing back to dust, may meanwhile perish out of memory again,
and yet again. To how many maimed and mourning millions is the first
and sole angel visitant, him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) easterns call Azrael!

<p/>I tried to get up next morning, but while I was dressing, and at
intervals drinking cold water from the _carafe_ on my washstand, with
design to brace up that trembling weakness which made dressing so
difficult, in came Mrs. Bretton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is an absurdity!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) morning accost. <div class="bookquote">``Not so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) added,
and dealing with me at once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own brusque, energetic fashion--that
fashion which I used formerly to enjoy seeing applied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) son, and
by him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) vigorously resisted--in two minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) consigned me captive to
the French bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There you lie till afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My boy left orders before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
went out that such should be the case, and I can assure you my son is
master and must be obeyed. Presently you shall have breakfast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) brought that meal--brought it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own active
hands--not leaving me to servants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) seated herself on the bed while
I ate. Now it is not everybody, even amongst our respected friends and
esteemed acquaintance, whom we like to have near us, whom we like to
watch us, to wait on us, to approach us with the proximity of a nurse
to a patient. It is not every friend whose eye is a light in a sick
room, whose presence is there a solace: but all this was Mrs. Bretton
to me; all this she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had ever been. Food or drink never pleased me so
well as when it came through her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) hands. I do not remember the occasion
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) entrance into a room had not made that room cheerier. Our
natures own predilections and antipathies alike strange. There are
people from whom we secretly shrink, whom we would personally avoid,
though reason confesses that they are good people: there are others
with faults of temper, &c., evident enough, beside whom we live
content, as if the air about them did us good. My godmother's lively
black eye and clear brunette cheek, her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) warm, prompt hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
self-reliant mood, her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) decided bearing, were all beneficial to me as
the atmosphere of some salubrious climate. Her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) son used to call her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``the old lady;''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>it filled me with pleasant wonder to note how the
alacrity and power of five-and-twenty still breathed from her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) and
around her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would bring my work here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) took from me the emptied
teacup, ``and sit with you the whole day, if that overbearing John
Graham had not put his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) veto upon such a proceeding. ``Now, mamma,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went out, `take notice, you are not to knock up your
god-daughter with gossip,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) particularly desired me to keep close
to my own quarters, and spare you my fine company. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) says, Lucy, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
thinks you have had a nervous fever, judging from your look,--is that
so?''

<p/>I replied that I did not quite know what my ailment had been, but that
I had certainly suffered a good deal especially in mind. Further, on
this subject, I did not consider it advisable to dwell, for the details
of what I had undergone belonged to a portion of my existence in which
I never expected my godmother to take a share. Into what a new region
would such a confidence have led that hale, serene nature! The
difference between her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) and me might be figured by that between the
stately ship cruising safe on smooth seas, with its full complement of
crew, a captain gay and brave, and venturous and provident; and the
life-boat, which most days of the year lies dry and solitary in an old,
dark boat-house, only putting to sea when the billows run high in rough
weather, when cloud encounters water, when danger and death divide
between them the rule of the great deep. No, the <div class="bookquote">``Louisa Bretton''  (<font color='red'><b>crew</b></font>)</div>never
was out of harbour on such a night, and in such a scene: her (<font color='blue'><b>crew</b></font>) crew could
not conceive it; so the half-drowned life-boat man keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
counsel, and spins no yarns.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>crew</b></font>) left me, and I lay in bed content: it was good of Graham to
remember me before he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) went out.

<p/>My day was lonely, but the prospect of coming evening abridged and
cheered it. Then, too, I felt weak, and rest seemed welcome; and after
the morning hours were gone by,--those hours which always bring, even
to the necessarily unoccupied, a sense of business to be done, of tasks
waiting fulfilment, a vague impression of obligation to be
employed--when this stirring time was past, and the silent descent of
afternoon hushed housemaid steps on the stairs and in the chambers, I
then passed into a dreamy mood, not unpleasant.

<p/>My calm little room seemed somehow like a cave in the sea. There was no
colour about it, except that white and pale green, suggestive of foam
and deep water; the blanched cornice was adorned with shell-shaped
ornaments, and there were white mouldings like dolphins in the
ceiling-angles. Even that one touch of colour visible in the red satin
pincushion bore affinity to coral; even that dark, shining glass might
have mirrored a mermaid. When I closed my eyes, I heard a gale,
subsiding at last, bearing upon the house-front like a settling swell
upon a rock-base. I heard it drawn and withdrawn far, far off, like a
tide retiring from a shore of the upper world--a world so high above
that the rush of its largest waves, the dash of its fiercest breakers,
could sound down in this submarine home, only like murmurs and a
lullaby.

<p/>Amidst these dreams came evening, and then Martha brought a light; with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) aid I was quickly dressed, and stronger now than in the morning, I
made my way down to the blue saloon unassisted.

<p/>Dr. John, it appears, had concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) round of professional calls
earlier than usual; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) form was the first object that met my eyes as I
entered the parlour; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stood in that window-recess opposite the door,
reading the close type of a newspaper by such dull light as closing day
yet gave. The fire shone clear, but the lamp stood on the table unlit,
and tea was not yet brought up.

<p/>As to Mrs. Bretton, my active godmother--who, I afterwards found, had
been out in the open air all day--lay half-reclined in her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)
deep-cushioned chair, actually lost in a nap. Her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) son seeing me, came
forward. I noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) trod carefully, not to wake the sleeper; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
also spoke low: his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mellow voice never had any sharpness in it;
modulated as at present, it was calculated rather to soothe than
startle slumber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a quiet little château,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) observed, after inviting me to sit
near the casement. ``I don't know whether you may have noticed it in
your walks: though, indeed, from the chaussée it is not visible; just a
mile beyond the Porte de Crécy, you turn down a lane which soon becomes
an avenue, and that leads you on, through meadow and shade, to the very
door of this house. It is not a modern place, but built somewhat in the
old style of the Basse-Ville. It is rather a manoir than a château;
they call it ``La Terrasse,<div class="bookquote">'' because its front rises from a broad turfed
walk, whence steps lead down a grassy slope to the avenue. See yonder!
The moon rises: she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) looks well through the tree-boles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Where, indeed, does the moon not look well? What is the scene, confined
or expansive, which her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) orb does not hallow? Rosy or fiery, she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) mounted
now above a not distant bank; even while we watched her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) flushed ascent,
she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) cleared to gold, and in very brief space, floated up stainless into
a now calm sky. Did moonlight soften or sadden Dr. Bretton? Did it
touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) with romance? I think it did. Albeit of no sighing mood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
sighed in watching it: sighed to himself quietly. No need to ponder the
cause or the course of that sigh; I knew it was wakened by beauty; I
knew it pursued Ginevra. Knowing this, the idea pressed upon me that it
was in some sort my duty to speak the name he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) meditated. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
was ready for the subject: I saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) countenance a teeming plenitude
of comment, question and interest; a pressure of language and
sentiment, only checked, I thought, by sense of embarrassment how to
begin. To spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) this embarrassment was my best, indeed my sole use.
I had but to utter the idol's name, and love's tender litany would flow
out. I had just found a fitting phrase, <div class="bookquote">``You know that Miss Fanshawe is
gone on a tour with the Cholmondeleys,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and was opening my lips to
speak to it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) scattered my plans by introducing another theme.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The first thing this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) sentiment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
pocket, turning from the moon, and sitting down, <div class="bookquote">``I went to the Rue
Fossette, and told the cuisinière that you were safe and in good hands.
Do you know that I actually found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had not yet discovered your
absence from the house: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) thought you safe in the great dormitory.
With what care you must have been waited on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! all that is very conceivable,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Goton could do nothing for
me but bring me a little tisane and a crust of bread, and I had
rejected both so often during the past week, that the good woman got
tired of useless journeys from the dwelling-house kitchen to the
school-dormitory, and only came once a day at noon to make my bed. I
believe, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a good-natured creature, and would have
been delighted to cook me côtelettes de mouton, if I could have eaten
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Madame Beck mean by leaving you alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame Beck could not foresee that I should fall ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your nervous system bore a good share of the suffering?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not quite sure what my nervous system is, but I was dreadfully
low-spirited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which disables me from helping you by pill or potion. Medicine can
give nobody good spirits. My art halts at the threshold of
Hypochondria: she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) just looks in and sees a chamber of torture, but can
neither say nor do much. Cheerful society would be of use; you should
be as little alone as possible; you should take plenty of exercise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Acquiescence and a pause followed these remarks. They sounded all
right, I thought, and bore the safe sanction of custom, and the
well-worn stamp of use.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>recommenced Dr. John--my health, nervous system included,
being now, somewhat to my relief, discussed and done with--<div class="bookquote">``is it
permitted me to ask what your religion is? Are you a Catholic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked up in some surprise--<div class="bookquote">``A Catholic? No! Why suggest such an
idea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The manner in which you were consigned to me last night made me doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I consigned to you? But, indeed, I forget. It yet remains for me to
learn how I fell into your hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Why, under circumstances that puzzled me. I had been in attendance all
day yesterday on a case of singularly interesting and critical
character; the disease being rare, and its treatment doubtful: I saw a
similar and still finer case in a hospital in Paris; but that will not
interest you. At last a mitigation of the patient's most urgent
symptoms -LRB-acute pain is one of its accompaniments-RRB- liberated me, and I
set out homeward. My shortest way lay through the Basse-Ville, and as
the night was excessively dark, wild, and wet, I took it. In riding
past an old church belonging to a community of Béguines, I saw by a
lamp burning over the porch or deep arch of the entrance, a priest
lifting some object in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) arms. The lamp was bright enough to reveal
the priest's features clearly, and I recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was a man I
have often met by the sick beds of both rich and poor: and chiefly the
latter. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is, I think, a good old man, far better than most of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
class in this country; superior, indeed, in every way, better informed,
as well as more devoted to duty. Our eyes met; he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) called on me to stop:
what he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) supported was a woman, fainting or dying. I alighted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`This person is one of your countrywomen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said: `save her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
is not dead.''

<p/>``My countrywoman, on examination, turned out to be the English teacher
at Madame Beck's pensionnat. She (<font color='blue'><b>countrywoman</b></font>) was perfectly unconscious, perfectly
bloodless, and nearly cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`What does it all mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) communicated a curious account; that you had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) that
evening at confessional; that your exhausted and suffering appearance,
coupled with some things you had said--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things I had said? I wonder what things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Awful crimes, no doubt; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) did not tell me what: there, you know,
the seal of the confessional checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) garrulity, and my curiosity.
Your confidences, however, had not made an enemy of the good father; it
seems he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so struck, and felt so sorry that you should be out on
such a night alone, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had esteemed it a Christian duty to watch
you when you quitted the church, and so to manage as not to lose sight
of you, till you should have reached home. Perhaps the worthy man
might, half unconsciously, have blent in this proceeding some little of
the subtlety of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) class: it might have been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolve to learn the
locality of your home--did you impart that in your confession?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not: on the contrary, I carefully avoided the shadow of any
indication: and as to my confession, Dr. John, I suppose you will think
me mad for taking such a step, but I could not help it: I suppose it
was all the fault of what you call my `nervous system.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot put
the case into words, but my days and nights were grown intolerable: a
cruel sense of desolation pained my mind: a feeling that would make its
way, rush out, or kill me--like -LRB-and this you will understand, Dr.
John-RRB- the current which passes through the heart, and which, if
aneurism or any other morbid cause obstructs its natural channels,
seeks abnormal outlet. I wanted companionship, I wanted friendship, I
wanted counsel. I could find none of these in closet or chamber, so I
went and sought them in church and confessional. As to what I said, it
was no confidence, no narrative. I have done nothing wrong: my life has
not been active enough for any dark deed, either of romance or reality:
all I poured out was a dreary, desperate complaint.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, you ought to travel for about six months: why, your calm nature
is growing quite excitable! Confound Madame Beck! Has the little buxom
widow no bowels, to condemn her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) best teacher to solitary confinement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not Madame Beck's fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``it is no living being's
fault, and I won't hear any one blamed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is in the wrong, then, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me--Dr. John--me; and a great abstraction on whose wide shoulders I
like to lay the mountains of blame they were sculptured to bear: me and
Fate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Me' must take better care in future,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Dr. John--smiling, I
suppose, at my bad grammar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Change of air--change of scene; those are my prescriptions,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>pursued
the practical young doctor. <div class="bookquote">``But to return to our muttons, Lucy. As
yet, Père Silas, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) tact -LRB-they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) is a Jesuit-RRB-, is no
wiser than you choose him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) to be; for, instead of returning to the Rue
Fossette, your fevered wanderings--there must have been high fever--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Dr. John: the fever took its turn that night--now, don't make out
that I was delirious, for I know differently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! you were as collected as myself at this moment, no doubt. Your
wanderings had taken an opposite direction to the pensionnat. Near the
Béguinage, amidst the stress of flood and gust, and in the perplexity
of darkness, you had swooned and fallen. The priest came to your
succour, and the physician, as we have seen, supervened. Between us we
procured a fiacre and brought you here. Père Silas, old as he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) is, would
carry you up-stairs, and lay you on that couch himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) would
certainly have remained with you till suspended animation had been
restored: and so should I, but, at that juncture, a hurried messenger
arrived from the dying patient I had scarcely left--the last duties
were called for--the physician's last visit and the priest's last rite;
extreme unction could not be deferred. Père Silas and myself departed
together, my mother was spending the evening abroad; we gave you in
charge to Martha, leaving directions, which it seems she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) followed
successfully. Now, are you a Catholic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``And never let Père Silas know where I
live, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) will try to convert me; but give him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) my best and truest
thanks when you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>), and if ever I get rich I will send him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) money
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) charities. See, Dr. John, your mother wakes; you ought to ring
for tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did; and, as Mrs. Bretton sat up--astonished and indignant at
herself for the indulgence to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had succumbed, and fully
prepared to deny that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had slept at all--her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) son came gaily to the
attack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hushaby, mamma! Sleep again. You look the picture of innocence in your
slumbers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My slumbers, John Graham! What are you talking about? You know I never
_do_ sleep by day: it was the slightest doze possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly! a seraph's gentle lapse--a fairy's dream. Mamma, under such
circumstances, you always remind me of Titania.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is because you, yourself, are so like Bottom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe--did you ever hear anything like mamma's wit? She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is a most
sprightly woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) size and age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep your compliments to yourself, sir, and do not neglect your own
size: which seems to me a good deal on the increase. Lucy, has he (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) not
rather the air of an incipient John Bull? He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) used to be slender as an
eel, and now I fancy in him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a sort of heavy dragoon bent--a beef-eater
tendency. Graham, take notice! If you grow fat I disown you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if you could not sooner disown your own personality! I am
indispensable to the old lady's happiness, Lucy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would pine away in
green and yellow melancholy if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had not my six feet of iniquity to
scold. It keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lively--it maintains the wholesome ferment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The two were now standing opposite to each other, one on each side the
fire-place; their words were not very fond, but their mutual looks
atoned for verbal deficiencies. At least, the best treasure of Mrs.
Bretton's life was certainly casketed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) son's bosom; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) dearest
pulse throbbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart. As to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), of course another love shared
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) feelings with filial love, and, no doubt, as the new passion was
the latest born, so he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) assigned it in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) emotions Benjamin's portion.
Ginevra! Ginevra! Did Mrs. Bretton yet know at whose feet her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own young
idol had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) homage? Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) approve that choice? I could not
tell; but I could well guess that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) knew Miss Fanshawe's conduct
towards Graham: her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) alternations between coldness and coaxing, and
repulse and allurement; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) could at all suspect the pain with which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had tried him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) could have seen, as I had seen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) fine
spirits subdued and harassed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) inferior preferred before him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
subordinate made the instrument of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) humiliation--_then_ Mrs. Bretton
would have pronounced Ginevra imbecile, or perverted, or both. Well--I
thought so too.

<p/>That second evening passed as sweetly as the first--_more_ sweetly
indeed: we enjoyed a smoother interchange of thought; old troubles were
not reverted to, acquaintance was better cemented; I felt happier,
easier, more at home. That night--instead of crying myself asleep--I
went down to dreamland by a pathway bordered with pleasant thoughts.




<p/>CHAPTER XVIII.

<p/>WE QUARREL.


<p/>During the first days of my stay at the Terrace, Graham never took a
seat near me, or in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) frequent pacing of the room approached the
quarter where I sat, or looked pre-occupied, or more grave than usual,
but I thought of Miss Fanshawe and expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) name to leap from his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
lips. I kept my ear and mind in perpetual readiness for the tender
theme; my patience was ordered to be permanently under arms, and my
sympathy desired to keep its cornucopia replenished and ready for
outpouring. At last, and after a little inward struggle, which I saw
and respected, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) one day launched into the topic. It was introduced
delicately; anonymously as it were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your friend is spending her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) vacation in travelling, I hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Friend, forsooth!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I to myself: but it would not do to
contradict; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) must have his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) own way; I must own the soft impeachment:
friend let it be. Still, by way of experiment, I could not help asking
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) meant?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had taken a seat at my work-table; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) now laid hands on a reel of
thread which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) proceeded recklessly to unwind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ginevra--Miss Fanshawe, has accompanied the Cholmondeleys on a tour
through the south of France?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) correspond?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will astonish you to hear that I never once thought of making
application for that privilege.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen letters of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) writing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; several to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will not be deficient in wit and _naïveté_; there is so much
sparkle, and so little art in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) soul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) writes comprehensively enough when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) writes to M. de
Bassompierre: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) who runs may read.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginevra/Miss Fanshawe/Ginevra Fanshawe</b></font>)</div>-LRB-In fact, Ginevra's epistles to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) wealthy kinsman were commonly business documents, unequivocal
applications for cash.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) handwriting? It must be pretty, light, ladylike, I should
think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was, and I said so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I verily believe that all she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) does is well done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Dr. John; and
as I seemed in no hurry to chime in with this remark, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added <div class="bookquote">``You,
who know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), could you name a point in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) is deficient?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) does several things very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Flirtation amongst the rest,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>subjoined I, in thought.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When do you suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) will return to town?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) soon inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, Dr. John, I must explain. You honour me too much in
ascribing to me a degree of intimacy with Miss Fanshawe I have not the
felicity to enjoy. I have never been the depositary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) plans and
secrets. You will find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) particular friends in another sphere than
mine: amongst the Cholmondeleys, for instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) actually thought I was stung with a kind of jealous pain similar to
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``judge her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) indulgently; the glitter of fashion
misleads her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) will soon find out that these people are hollow,
and will return to you with augmented attachment and confirmed trust. I
know something of the Cholmondeleys: superficial, showy, selfish
people; depend on it, at heart Ginevra values you beyond a score of
such.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said briefly.

<p/>A disclaimer of the sentiments attributed to me burned on my lips, but
I extinguished the flame. I submitted to be looked upon as the
humiliated, cast-off, and now pining confidante of the distinguished
Miss Fanshawe: but, reader, it was a hard submission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>continued Graham, <div class="bookquote">``while I comfort _you_, I cannot take
the same consolation to myself; I cannot hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) will do me justice.
De Hamal is most worthless, yet I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) pleases her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>): wretched
delusion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>My patience really gave way, and without notice: all at once. I suppose
illness and weakness had worn it and made it brittle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Bretton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I broke out, <div class="bookquote">``there is no delusion like your own. On all
points but one you are a man, frank, healthful, right-thinking,
clear-sighted: on this exceptional point you are but a slave. I
declare, where Miss Fanshawe is concerned, you merit no respect; nor
have you mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I got up, and left the room very much excited.

<p/>This little scene took place in the morning; I had to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) again in
the evening, and then I saw I had done mischief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was not made of
common clay, not put together out of vulgar materials; while the
outlines of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) nature had been shaped with breadth and vigour, the
details embraced workmanship of almost feminine delicacy: finer, much
finer, than you could be prepared to meet with; than you could believe
inherent in him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), even after years of acquaintance. Indeed, till some
over-sharp contact with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) nerves had betrayed, by its effects, their
acute sensibility, this elaborate construction must be ignored; and the
more especially because the sympathetic faculty was not prominent in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>): to feel, and to seize quickly another's feelings, are separate
properties; a few constructions possess both, some neither. Dr. John
had the one in exquisite perfection; and because I have admitted that
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not endowed with the other in equal degree, the reader will
considerately refrain from passing to an extreme, and pronouncing him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
_un_sympathizing, unfeeling: on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was a kind, generous
man. Make your need known, his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) hand was open. Put your grief into
words, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) turned no deaf ear. Expect refinements of perception,
miracles of intuition, and realize disappointment. This night, when Dr.
John entered the room, and met the evening lamp, I saw well and at one
glance his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) whole mechanism.

<p/>To one who had named him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``slave,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and, on any point, banned him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) from
respect, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) must now have peculiar feelings. That the epithet was well
applied, and the ban just, might be; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) put forth no denial that it was
so: his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mind even candidly revolved that unmanning possibility. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
sought in this accusation the cause of that ill-success which had got
so galling a hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mental peace: Amid the worry of a
self-condemnatory soliloquy, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) demeanour seemed grave, perhaps cold,
both to me and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother. And yet there was no bad feeling, no malice,
no rancour, no littleness in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) countenance, beautiful with a man's
best beauty, even in its depression. When I placed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chair at the
table, which I hastened to do, anticipating the servant, and when I
handed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tea, which I did with trembling care, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Thank
you, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in as kindly a tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) full pleasant voice as ever my
ear welcomed.

<p/>For my part, there was only one plan to be pursued; I must expiate my
culpable vehemence, or I must not sleep that night. This would not do
at all; I could not stand it: I made no pretence of capacity to wage
war on this footing. School solitude, conventual silence and
stagnation, anything seemed preferable to living embroiled with Dr.
John. As to Ginevra, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) might take the silver wings of a dove, or any
other fowl that flies, and mount straight up to the highest place,
among the highest stars, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) lover's highest flight of fancy
chose to fix the constellation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) charms: never more be it mine to
dispute the arrangement. Long I tried to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eye. Again and again
that eye just met mine; but, having nothing to say, it withdrew, and I
was baffled. After tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sat, sad and quiet, reading a book. I wished
I could have dared to go and sit near him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), but it seemed that if I
ventured to take that step, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would infallibly evince hostility and
indignation. I longed to speak out, and I dared not whisper. His (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mother
left the room; then, moved by insupportable regret, I just murmured the
words <div class="bookquote">``Dr. Bretton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) book; his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eyes were not cold or malevolent, his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
mouth was not cynical; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was ready and willing to hear what I might
have to say: his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) spirit was of vintage too mellow and generous to sour
in one thunder-clap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Bretton, forgive my hasty words: _do, do_ forgive them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) smiled that moment I spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I deserved them, Lucy. If you
don't respect me, I am sure it is because I am not respectable. I fear,
I am an awkward fool: I must manage badly in some way, for where I wish
to please, it seems I don't please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of that you cannot be sure; and even if such be the case, is it the
fault of your character, or of another's perceptions? But now, let me
unsay what I said in anger. In one thing, and in all things, I deeply
respect you. If you think scarcely enough of yourself, and too much of
others, what is that but an excellence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I think too much of Ginevra?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ believe you may; _you_ believe you can't. Let us agree to differ.
Let me be pardoned; that is what I ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I cherish ill-will for one warm word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I see you do not and cannot; but just say, ``Lucy, I forgive you!<div class="bookquote">'' Say
that, to ease me of the heart-ache.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put away your heart-ache, as I will put away mine; for you wounded me
a little, Lucy. Now, when the pain is gone, I more than forgive: I feel
grateful, as to a sincere well-wisher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _am_ your sincere well-wisher: you are right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus our quarrel ended.

<p/>Reader, if in the course of this work, you find that my opinion of Dr.
John undergoes modification, excuse the seeming inconsistency. I give
the feeling as at the time I felt it; I describe the view of character
as it appeared when discovered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) showed the fineness of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) nature by being kinder to me after that
misunderstanding than before. Nay, the very incident which, by my
theory, must in some degree estrange me and him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), changed, indeed,
somewhat our relations; but not in the sense I painfully anticipated.
An invisible, but a cold something, very slight, very transparent, but
very chill: a sort of screen of ice had hitherto, all through our two
lives, glazed the medium through which we exchanged intercourse. Those
few warm words, though only warm with anger, breathed on that frail
frost-work of reserve; about this time, it gave note of dissolution. I
think from that day, so long as we continued friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) never in
discourse stood on topics of ceremony with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) seemed to know that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) would but talk about himself, and about that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was most
interested, my expectation would always be answered, my wish always
satisfied. It follows, as a matter of course, that I continued to hear
much of <div class="bookquote">``Ginevra.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ginevra!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) so fair, so good; he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) spoke so lovingly of her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)
charms, her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) sweetness, her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) innocence, that, in spite of my plain prose
knowledge of the reality, a kind of reflected glow began to settle on
her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) idea, even for me. Still, reader, I am free to confess, that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
often talked nonsense; but I strove to be unfailingly patient with him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>).
I had had my lesson: I had learned how severe for me was the pain of
crossing, or grieving, or disappointing him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>). In a strange and new
sense, I grew most selfish, and quite powerless to deny myself the
delight of indulging his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) mood, and being pliant to his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) still
seemed to me most absurd when he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) obstinately doubted, and desponded
about his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) power to win in the end Miss Fanshawe's preference. The fancy
became rooted in my own mind more stubbornly than ever, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was
only coquetting to goad him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), and that, at heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) coveted everyone
of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) words and looks. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) harassed me, in spite of my
resolution to bear and hear; in the midst of the indescribable
gall-honey pleasure of thus bearing and hearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) struck so on the
flint of what firmness I owned, that it emitted fire once and again. I
chanced to assert one day, with a view to stilling his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) impatience, that
in my own mind, I felt positive Miss Fanshawe _must_ intend eventually
to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Positive! It was easy to say so, but had I any grounds for such
assurance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The best grounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Lucy, _do_ tell me what!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know them as well as I; and, knowing them, Dr. John, it really
amazes me that you should not repose the frankest confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
fidelity. To doubt, under the circumstances, is almost to insult.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are beginning to speak fast and to breathe short; but speak a
little faster and breathe a little shorter, till you have given an
explanation--a full explanation: I must have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall, Dr. John. In some cases, you are a lavish, generous man:
you are a worshipper ever ready with the votive offering should Père
Silas ever convert _you_, you will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) abundance of alms for his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>)
poor, you will supply his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) altar with tapers, and the shrine of your
favourite saint you will do your best to enrich: Ginevra, Dr. John--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``don't go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, I will _not_: and go on I _will_: Ginevra has had her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) hands
filled from your hands more times than I can count. You have sought for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) the costliest flowers; you have busied your brain in devising gifts
the most delicate: such, one would have thought, as only a woman could
have imagined; and in addition, Miss Fanshawe owns a set of ornaments,
to purchase which your generosity must have verged on extravagance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>admirer</b></font>)</div><p/>The modesty Ginevra herself had never evinced in this matter, now
flushed all over the face of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) admirer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) said, destructively snipping a skein of silk with my
scissors. <div class="bookquote">``I offered them to please myself: I felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) did me a favour
in accepting them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) did more than a favour, Dr. John: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) pledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) very honour that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would make you some return; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) cannot pay you in affection,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) ought to hand out a business-like equivalent, in the shape of some
rouleaux of gold pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) is far too disinterested to care for
my gifts, and too simple-minded to know their value.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I laughed out: I had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) adjudge to every jewel its price; and
well I knew money-embarrassment, money-schemes; money's worth, and
endeavours to realise supplies, had, young as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was, furnished the
most frequent, and the favourite stimulus of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) thoughts for years.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) pursued. <div class="bookquote">``You should have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) whenever I have laid on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) lap
some trifle; so cool, so unmoved: no eagerness to take, not even
pleasure in contemplating. Just from amiable reluctance to grieve me,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would permit the bouquet to lie beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), and perhaps consent to
bear it away. Or, if I achieved the fastening of a bracelet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
ivory arm, however pretty the trinket might be -LRB-and I always carefully
chose what seemed to _me_ pretty, and what of course was not
valueless-RRB-, the glitter never dazzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) bright eyes: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would hardly
cast one look on my gift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, of course, not valuing it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would unloose, and return it to
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; for such a repulse she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was too good-natured. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would consent to
seem to forget what I had done, and retain the offering with lady-like
quiet and easy oblivion. Under such circumstances, how can a man build
on acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presents as a favourable symptom? For my part,
were I to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) all I have, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) to take it, such is her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
incapacity to be swayed by sordid considerations, I should not venture
to believe the transaction advanced me one step.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. John,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, <div class="bookquote">``Love is blind;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but just then a blue subtle ray
sped sideways from Dr. John's eye: it reminded me of old days, it
reminded me of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) picture: it half led me to think that part, at
least, of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) professed persuasion of Miss Fanshawe's _naïveté_ was
assumed; it led me dubiously to conjecture that perhaps, in spite of
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) beauty, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) appreciation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) foibles might
possibly be less mistaken, more clear-sighted, than from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) general
language was presumable. After all it might be only a chance look, or
at best the token of a merely momentary impression. Chance or
intentional real or imaginary, it closed the conversation.




<p/>CHAPTER XIX.

<p/>THE CLEOPATRA.


<p/>My stay at La Terrasse was prolonged a fortnight beyond the close of
the vacation. Mrs. Bretton's kind management procured me this respite.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) son having one day delivered the dictum that <div class="bookquote">``Lucy was not yet
strong enough to go back to that den of a pensionnat,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) at once
drove over to the Rue Fossette, had an interview with the directress,
and procured the indulgence, on the plea of prolonged rest and change
being necessary to perfect recovery. Hereupon, however, followed an
attention I could very well have dispensed with, viz--a polite call
from Madame Beck.

<p/>That lady--one fine day--actually came out in a fiacre as far as the
château. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had resolved within herself to see what manner
of place Dr. John inhabited. Apparently, the pleasant site and neat
interior surpassed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expectations; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eulogized all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw,
pronounced the blue salon <div class="bookquote">``une pièce magnifique,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>profusely
congratulated me on the acquisition of friends, <div class="bookquote">``tellement dignes,
aimables, et respectables,''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>turned also a neat compliment in my favour,
and, upon Dr. John coming in, ran up to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with the utmost buoyancy,
opening at the same time such a fire of rapid language, all sparkling
with felicitations and protestations about his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``château,'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``madame sa
mère, la digne châtelaine:''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>also his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looks; which, indeed, were very
flourishing, and at the moment additionally embellished by the
good-natured but amused smile with which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) always listened to Madame's
fluent and florid French. In short, Madame shone in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) very best phase
that day, and came in and went out quite a living catherine-wheel of
compliments, delight, and affability. Half purposely, and half to ask
some question about school-business, I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to the carriage,
and looked in after she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was seated and the door closed. In that brief
fraction of time what a change had been wrought! An instant ago, all
sparkles and jests, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) now sat sterner than a judge and graver than a
sage. Strange little woman!

<p/>I went back and teased Dr. John about Madame's devotion to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). How he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
laughed! What fun shone in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) recalled some of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fine
speeches, and repeated them, imitating her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voluble delivery! He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had an
acute sense of humour, and was the finest company in the world--when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
could forget Miss Fanshawe.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>To <div class="bookquote">``sit in sunshine calm and sweet''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>is said to be excellent for weak
people; it gives them vital force. When little Georgette Beck was
recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) illness, I used to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) in my arms and walk
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) in the garden by the hour together, beneath a certain wall
hung with grapes, which the Southern sun was ripening: that sun
cherished her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) little pale frame quite as effectually as it mellowed and
swelled the clustering fruit.

<p/>There are human tempers, bland, glowing, and genial, within whose
influence it is as good for the poor in spirit to live, as it is for
the feeble in frame to bask in the glow of noon. Of the number of these
choice natures were certainly both Dr. Bretton's and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mother's. They
liked to communicate happiness, as some like to occasion misery: they
did it instinctively; without fuss, and apparently with little
consciousness; the means to give pleasure rose spontaneously in their
minds. Every day while I stayed with them, some little plan was
proposed which resulted in beneficial enjoyment. Fully occupied as was
Dr. John's time, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) still made it in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way to accompany us in each
brief excursion. I can hardly tell how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) managed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) engagements; they
were numerous, yet by dint of system, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) classed them in an order which
left him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a daily period of liberty. I often saw him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hard-worked, yet
seldom over-driven, and never irritated, confused, or oppressed. What
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did was accomplished with the ease and grace of all-sufficing
strength; with the bountiful cheerfulness of high and unbroken
energies. Under his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) guidance I saw, in that one happy fortnight, more
of Villette, its environs, and its inhabitants, than I had seen in the
whole eight months of my previous residence. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took me to places of
interest in the town, of whose names I had not before so much as heard;
with willingness and spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) communicates much noteworthy
information. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) never seemed to think it a trouble to talk to me, and,
I am sure, it was never a task to me to listen. It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way to
treat subjects coldly and vaguely; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) rarely generalized, never prosed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed to like nice details almost as much as I liked them myself:
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed observant of character: and not superficially observant,
either. These points gave the quality of interest to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) discourse; and
the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) speaking direct from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own resources, and not
borrowing or stealing from books--here a dry fact, and there a trite
phrase, and elsewhere a hackneyed opinion--ensured a freshness, as
welcome as it was rare. Before my eyes, too, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) disposition seemed to
unfold another phase; to pass to a fresh day: to rise in new and nobler
dawn.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother possessed a good development of benevolence, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) owned a
better and larger. I found, on accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to the Basse-Ville--the
poor and crowded quarter of the city--that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) errands there were as
much those of the philanthropist as the physician. I understood
presently that cheerfully, habitually, and in single-minded
unconsciousness of any special merit distinguishing his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) deeds--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was
achieving, amongst a very wretched population, a world of active good.
The lower orders liked him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) well; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) poor, patients in the hospitals
welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with a sort of enthusiasm.

<p/>But stop--I must not, from the faithful narrator, degenerate into the
partial eulogist. Well, full well, do I know that Dr. John was not
perfect, anymore than I am perfect. Human fallibility leavened him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
throughout: there was no hour, and scarcely a moment of the time I
spent with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that in act or speech, or look, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not betray
something that was not of a god. A god could not have the cruel vanity
of Dr. John, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sometime levity. No immortal could have resembled
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) occasional temporary oblivion of all but the present--in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
passing passion for that present; shown not coarsely, by devoting it to
material indulgence, but selfishly, by extracting from it whatever it
could yield of nutriment to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) masculine self-love: his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) delight was to
feed that ravenous sentiment, without thought of the price of
provender, or care for the cost of keeping it sleek and high-pampered.

<p/>The reader is requested to note a seeming contradiction in the two
views which have been given of Graham Bretton--the public and
private--the out-door and the in-door view. In the first, the public,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is shown oblivious of self; as modest in the display of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
energies, as earnest in their exercise. In the second, the fireside
picture, there is expressed consciousness of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) has and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
is; pleasure in homage, some recklessness in exciting, some vanity in
receiving the same. Both portraits are correct.

<p/>It was hardly possible to oblige Dr. John quietly and in secret. When
you thought that the fabrication of some trifle dedicated to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) use
had been achieved unnoticed, and that, like other men, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would use it
when placed ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) use, and never ask whence it came, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) amazed
you by a smilingly-uttered observation or two, proving that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eye had
been on the work from commencement to close: that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had noted the
design, traced its progress, and marked its completion. It pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
to be thus served, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pleasure beam in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eye and play
about his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>This would have been all very well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not added to such kindly
and unobtrusive evidence a certain wilfulness in discharging what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
called debts. When his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother worked for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by showering
about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) bright animal spirits, with even more affluence than his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
gay, taunting, teasing, loving wont. If Lucy Snowe were discovered to
have put her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) hand to such work, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) planned, in recompence, some
pleasant recreation.

<p/>I often felt amazed at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) perfect knowledge of Villette; a knowledge
not merely confined to its open streets, but penetrating to all its
galleries, salles, and cabinets: of every door which shut in an object
worth seeing, of every museum, of every hall, sacred to art or science,
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed to possess the <div class="bookquote">``Open! Sesame.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I never had a head for
science, but an ignorant, blind, fond instinct inclined me to art. I
liked to visit the picture-galleries, and I dearly liked to be left
there alone. In company, a wretched idiosyncracy forbade me to see much
or to feel anything. In unfamiliar company, where it was necessary to
maintain a flow of talk on the subjects in presence, half an hour would
knock me up, with a combined pressure of physical lassitude and entire
mental incapacity. I never yet saw the well-reared child, much less the
educated adult, who could not put me to shame, by the sustained
intelligence of its demeanour under the ordeal of a conversable,
sociable visitation of pictures, historical sights or buildings, or any
lions of public interest. Dr. Bretton was a cicerone after my own
heart; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) would take me betimes, ere the galleries were filled, leave
me there for two or three hours, and call for me when his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own
engagements were discharged. Meantime, I was happy; happy, not always
in admiring, but in examining, questioning, and forming conclusions. In
the commencement of these visits, there was some misunderstanding and
consequent struggle between Will and Power. The former faculty exacted
approbation of that which it was considered orthodox to admire; the
latter groaned forth its utter inability to pay the tax; it was then
self-sneered at, spurred up, goaded on to refine its taste, and whet
its zest. The more it was chidden, however, the more it wouldn't
praise. Discovering gradually that a wonderful sense of fatigue
resulted from these conscientious efforts, I began to reflect whether I
might not dispense with that great labour, and concluded eventually
that I might, and so sank supine into a luxury of calm before
ninety-nine out of a hundred of the exhibited frames.

<p/>It seemed to me that an original and good picture was just as scarce as
an original and good book; nor did I, in the end, tremble to say to
myself, standing before certain _chef-d'oeuvres_ bearing great names,
<div class="bookquote">``These are not a whit like nature. Nature's daylight never had that
colour: never was made so turbid, either by storm or cloud, as it is
laid out there, under a sky of indigo: and that indigo is not ether;
and those dark weeds plastered upon it are not trees.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Several very
well executed and complacent-looking fat women struck me as by no means
the goddesses they appeared to consider themselves. Many scores of
marvellously-finished little Flemish pictures, and also of sketches,
excellent for fashion-books displaying varied costumes in the
handsomest materials, gave evidence of laudable industry whimsically
applied. And yet there were fragments of truth here and there which
satisfied the conscience, and gleams of light that cheered the vision.
Nature's power here broke through in a mountain snow-storm; and there
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) glory in a sunny southern day. An expression in this portrait
proved clear insight into character; a face in that historical
painting, by its vivid filial likeness, startlingly reminded you that
genius gave it birth. These exceptions I loved: they grew dear as
friends.

<p/>One day, at a quiet early hour, I found myself nearly alone in a
certain gallery, wherein one particular picture of portentous size, set
up in the best light, having a cordon of protection stretched before
it, and a cushioned bench duly set in front for the accommodation of
worshipping connoisseurs, who, having gazed themselves off their feet,
might be fain to complete the business sitting: this picture, I say,
seemed to consider itself the queen of the collection.

<p/>It represented a woman, considerably larger, I thought, than the life.
I calculated that this lady, put into a scale of magnitude, suitable
for the reception of a commodity of bulk, would infallibly turn from
fourteen to sixteen stone. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, indeed, extremely well fed: very
much butcher's meat--to say nothing of bread, vegetables, and
liquids--must she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have consumed to attain that breadth and height, that
wealth of muscle, that affluence of flesh. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lay half-reclined on a
couch: why, it would be difficult to say; broad daylight blazed round
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared in hearty health, strong enough to do the work of two
plain cooks; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not plead a weak spine; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ought to have been
standing, or at least sitting bolt upright. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), had no business to
lounge away the noon on a sofa. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ought likewise to have worn decent
garments; a gown covering her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) properly, which was not the case: out of
abundance of material--seven-and-twenty yards, I should say, of
drapery--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) managed to make inefficient raiment. Then, for the
wretched untidiness surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), there could be no excuse. Pots and
pans--perhaps I ought to say vases and goblets--were rolled here and
there on the foreground; a perfect rubbish of flowers was mixed amongst
them, and an absurd and disorderly mass of curtain upholstery smothered
the couch and cumbered the floor. On referring to the catalogue, I
found that this notable production bore the name <div class="bookquote">``Cleopatra.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, I was sitting wondering at it -LRB-as the bench was there, I thought
I might as well take advantage of its accommodation-RRB-, and thinking that
while some of the details--as roses, gold cups, jewels, &c., were very
prettily painted, it was on the whole an enormous piece of claptrap;
the room, almost vacant when I entered, began to fill. Scarcely
noticing this circumstance -LRB-as, indeed, it did not matter to me-RRB- I
retained my seat; rather to rest myself than with a view to studying
this huge, dark-complexioned gipsy-queen; of whom, indeed, I soon
tired, and betook myself for refreshment to the contemplation of some
exquisite little pictures of still life: wild-flowers, wild-fruit,
mossy woodnests, casketing eggs that looked like pearls seen through
clear green sea-water; all hung modestly beneath that coarse and
preposterous canvas.

<p/>Suddenly a light tap visited my shoulder. Starting, turning, I met a
face bent to encounter mine; a frowning, almost a shocked face it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Que faites-vous ici?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais, Monsieur, je m`amuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vous vous amusez! et à quoi, s`il vous plait? Mais d'abord, faites-moi
le plaisir de vous lever; prenez mon bras, et allons de l'autre côté.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I did precisely as I was bid. M. Paul Emanuel -LRB-it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)-RRB- returned from
Rome, and now a travelled man, was not likely to be less tolerant of
insubordination now, than before this added distinction laurelled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
temples.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Permit me to conduct you to your party,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as we crossed the
room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you come here unaccompanied?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Monsieur. Dr. Bretton brought me here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Bretton and Madame his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mother, of course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; only Dr. Bretton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) told you to look at _that_ picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means; I found it out for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Paul's hair was shorn close as raven down, or I think it would have
bristled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head. Beginning now to perceive his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) drift, I had a
certain pleasure in keeping cool, and working him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Astounding insular audacity!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>cried the Professor. <div class="bookquote">``Singulières femmes
que ces Anglaises!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, Monsieur?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Matter! How dare you, a young person, sit coolly down, with the
self-possession of a garçon, and look at _that_ picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a very ugly picture, but I cannot at all see why I should not
look at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bon! bon! Speak no more of it. But you ought not to be here alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If, however, I have no society--no _party_, as you say? And then, what
does it signify whether I am alone, or accompanied? nobody meddles with
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Taisez-vous, et asseyez-vous là--là!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--setting down a chair with
emphasis in a particularly dull corner, before a series of most
specially dreary <div class="bookquote">``cadres.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais, Monsieur?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais, Mademoiselle, asseyez-vous, et ne bougez
pas--entendez-vous?--jusqu'à ce qu'on vienne vous chercher, ou que je
vous donne la permission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quel triste coin!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I, <div class="bookquote">``et quelles laids tableaux!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And <div class="bookquote">``laids,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>indeed, they were; being a set of four, denominated in the
catalogue <div class="bookquote">``La vie d'une femme.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were painted rather in a
remarkable style--flat, dead, pale, and formal. The first represented a
<div class="bookquote">``Jeune Fille,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>coming out of a church-door, a missal in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
dress very prim, her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes cast down, her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth pursed up--the image of
a most villanous little precocious she-hypocrite. The second, a
<div class="bookquote">``Mariée,''  (<font color='red'><b>the whites</b></font>)</div>with a long white veil, kneeling at a prie-dieu in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
chamber, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands plastered together, finger to finger, and
showing the whites of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes in a most exasperating manner. The
third, a <div class="bookquote">``Jeune Mère,''  (<font color='red'><b>baby</b></font>)</div>hanging disconsolate over a clayey and puffy
baby with a face like an unwholesome full moon. The fourth, a <div class="bookquote">``Veuve,''
 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>being a black woman, holding by the hand a black little girl, and the
twain studiously surveying an elegant French monument, set up in a
corner of some Père la Chaise. All these four <div class="bookquote">``Anges''  (<font color='red'><b>burglars</b></font>)</div>were grim and
grey as burglars, and cold and vapid as ghosts. What women to live
with! insincere, ill-humoured, bloodless, brainless nonentities! As bad
in their way as the indolent gipsy-giantess, the Cleopatra, in hers.

<p/>It was impossible to keep one's attention long confined to these
master-pieces, and so, by degrees, I veered round, and surveyed the
gallery.

<p/>A perfect crowd of spectators was by this time gathered round the
Lioness, from whose vicinage I had been banished; nearly half this
crowd were ladies, but M. Paul afterwards told me, these were <div class="bookquote">``des
dames,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and it was quite proper for them to contemplate what no
<div class="bookquote">``demoiselle''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>ought to glance at. I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) plainly I could not
agree in this doctrine, and did not see the sense of it; whereupon,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) usual absolutism, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) merely requested my silence, and also, in
the same breath, denounced my mingled rashness and ignorance. A more
despotic little man than M. Paul never filled a professor's chair. I
noticed, by the way, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at the picture himself quite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
ease, and for a very long while: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not, however, neglect to glance
from time to time my way, in order, I suppose, to make sure that I was
obeying orders, and not breaking bounds. By-and-by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) again accosted
me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had I not been ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wished to know: <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) understood I had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I was now quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where had I spent the vacation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chiefly in the Rue Fossette; partly with Madame Bretton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) had heard that I was left alone in the Rue Fossette; was that so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite alone: Marie Broc''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the crétin-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``was with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shoulders; varied and contradictory expressions played
rapidly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) countenance. Marie Broc was well known to M. Paul; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
never gave a lesson in the third division -LRB-containing the least
advanced pupils-RRB-, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Broc</b></font>) did not occasion in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a sharp conflict
between antagonistic impressions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Broc</b></font>) personal appearance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Broc</b></font>)
repulsive manners, her (<font color='blue'><b>Broc</b></font>) often unmanageable disposition, irritated his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
temper, and inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with strong antipathy; a feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was too
apt to conceive when his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) taste was offended or his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) will thwarted. On
the other hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Broc</b></font>) misfortunes, constituted a strong claim on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
forbearance and compassion--such a claim as it was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nature to
deny; hence resulted almost daily drawn battles between impatience and
disgust on the one hand, pity and a sense of justice on the other; in
which, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) credit be it said, it was very seldom that the former
feelings prevailed: when they did, however, M. Paul showed a phase of
character which had its terrors. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) passions were strong, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
aversions and attachments alike vivid; the force he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) exerted in holding
both in check by no means mitigated an observer's sense of their
vehemence. With such tendencies, it may well be supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) often
excited in ordinary minds fear and dislike; yet it was an error to fear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>): nothing drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) so nearly frantic as the tremor of an
apprehensive and distrustful spirit; nothing soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) like
confidence tempered with gentleness. To evince these sentiments,
however, required a thorough comprehension of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nature; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
nature was of an order rarely comprehended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you get on with Marie Broc?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked, after some minutes'
silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, I did my best; but it was terrible to be alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Broc</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have, then, a weak heart! You lack courage; and, perhaps, charity.
Yours are not the qualities which might constitute a Sister of Mercy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was a religious little man, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) way: the self-denying and
self-sacrificing part of the Catholic religion commanded the homage of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul.-RSB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, indeed: I took as good care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) as I could; but when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) aunt came to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) away, it was a great relief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are an egotist. There are women who have nursed hospitals-full

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could Monsieur do it himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women who are worthy the name ought infinitely to surpass; our coarse,
fallible, self-indulgent sex, in the power to perform such duties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I washed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>), I kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) clean, I fed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>), I tried to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>); but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) made mouths at me instead of speaking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think you did great things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but as great as I _could_ do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then limited are your powers, for in tending one idiot you fell sick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not with that, Monsieur; I had a nervous fever: my mind was ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vraiment! Vous valez peu de chose. You are not cast in an heroic
mould; your courage will not avail to sustain you in solitude; it
merely gives you the temerity to gaze with sang-froid at pictures of
Cleopatra.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>It would have been easy to show anger at the teasing, hostile tone of
the little man. I had never been angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yet, however, and had
no present disposition to begin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cleopatra!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, too, has been looking at
Cleopatra; what does he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cela ne vaut rien,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) responded. <div class="bookquote">``Une femme superbe--une taille

jeterez plus un seul coup d'oeil de sa côté.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) a great many times while Monsieur has been

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, M. Paul; they are too hideous: but if you admire them,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, grimacing a half-smile, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended
for a smile, though it was but a grim and hurried manifestation. <div class="bookquote">``You
nurslings of Protestantism astonish me. You unguarded Englishwomen walk

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so--Yes, I see there a person I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, I had caught a glimpse of a head too pretty to belong to any
other than the redoubted Colonel de Hamal. What a very finished, highly
polished little pate it was! What a figure, so trim and natty! What
womanish feet and hands! How daintily he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) held a glass to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>)
optics! with what admiration he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) gazed upon the Cleopatra! and then, how
engagingly he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) tittered and whispered a friend at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) elbow! Oh, the man
of sense! Oh, the refined gentleman of superior taste and tact! I
observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) for about ten minutes, and perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) was
exceedingly taken with this dusk and portly Venus of the Nile. So much
was I interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) bearing, so absorbed in divining his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) character
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) looks and movements, I temporarily forgot M. Paul; in the
interim a group came between that gentleman and me; or possibly his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
scruples might have received another and worse shock from my present
abstraction, causing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to withdraw voluntarily: at any rate, when I
again looked round, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>My eye, pursuant of the search, met not him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), but another and dissimilar
figure, well seen amidst the crowd, for the height as well as the port
lent each its distinction. This way came Dr. John, in visage, in shape,
in hue, as unlike the dark, acerb, and caustic little professor, as the
fruit of the Hesperides might be unlike the sloe in the wild thicket;
as the high-couraged but tractable Arabian is unlike the rude and
stubborn <div class="bookquote">``sheltie.''  (<font color='red'><b>professor</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) was looking for me, but had not yet explored the
corner where the schoolmaster had just put me. I remained quiet; yet
another minute I would watch.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) approached de Hamal; he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) paused near him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>); I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) had a pleasure
in looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) head; Dr. Bretton, too, gazed on the Cleopatra. I
doubt if it were to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) taste: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) did not simper like the little Count;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mouth looked fastidious, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) eye cool; without demonstration he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
stepped aside, leaving room for others to approach. I saw now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
was waiting, and, rising, I joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>).

<p/>We took one turn round the gallery; with Graham it was very pleasant to
take such a turn. I always liked dearly to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had to say
about either pictures or books; because without pretending to be a
connoisseur, he (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) always spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) thought, and that was sure to be
fresh: very often it was also just and pithy. It was pleasant also to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) some things he (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) did not know--he (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) listened so kindly, so
teachably; unformalized by scruples lest so to bend his (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) bright handsome
head, to gather a woman's rather obscure and stammering explanation,
should imperil the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) manhood. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) communicated
information in return, it was with a lucid intelligence that left all
his (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) words clear graven on the memory; no explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) giving, no
fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) narrating, did I ever forget.

<p/>As we left the gallery, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) thought of the Cleopatra
-LRB-after making him (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) laugh by telling him (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) how Professor Emanuel had sent
me to the right about, and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) to see the sweet series of
pictures recommended to my attention.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My mother is a better-looking woman. I heard some
French fops, yonder, designating her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as `le type du voluptueux;' if so,
I can only say, `le voluptueux' is little to my liking. Compare that
mulatto with Ginevra!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XX.

<p/>THE CONCERT.


<p/>One morning, Mrs. Bretton, coming promptly into my room, desired me to
open my drawers and show her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) my dresses; which I did, without a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had turned them over. <div class="bookquote">``You must have
a new one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) went out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) returned presently with a dressmaker. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had me
measured. <div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to follow my own taste, and to have my
own way in this little matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Two days after came home--a pink dress!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, hurriedly, feeling that I would almost as
soon clothe myself in the costume of a Chinese lady of rank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall see whether it is for you or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>godmother</b></font>)</div>rejoined my godmother,
adding with her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) resistless decision: <div class="bookquote">``Mark my words. You will wear it
this very evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>godmother</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought I should not; I thought no human force should avail to put me
into it. A pink dress! I knew it not. It knew not me. I had not proved
it.

<p/>My godmother went on to decree that I was to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) and Graham to
a concert that same night: which concert, she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) explained, was a grand
affair to be held in the large salle, or hall, of the principal musical
society. The most advanced of the pupils of the Conservatoire were to
perform: it was to be followed by a lottery <div class="bookquote">``au bénéfice des pauvres;''
 (<font color='red'><b>the pupils</b></font>)</div>and to crown all, the King, Queen, and Prince of Labassecour were to be
present. Graham, in sending tickets, had enjoined attention to costume
as a compliment due to royalty: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) also recommended punctual readiness
by seven o'clock.

<p/>About six, I was ushered upstairs. Without any force at all, I found
myself led and influenced by another's will, unconsulted, unpersuaded,
quietly overruled. In short, the pink dress went on, softened by some
drapery of black lace. I was pronounced to be en grande tenue, and
requested to look in the glass. I did so with some fear and trembling;
with more fear and trembling, I turned away. Seven o'clock struck; Dr.
Bretton was come; my godmother and I went down. _She (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>)_ was clad in brown
velvet; as I walked in her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) shadow, how I envied her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) those folds of
grave, dark majesty! Graham stood in the drawing-room doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I _do_ hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) will not think I have been decking myself out to draw
attention,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my uneasy aspiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Lucy, are some flowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), giving me a bouquet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) took
no further notice of my dress than was conveyed in a kind smile and
satisfied nod, which calmed at once my sense of shame and fear of
ridicule. For the rest; the dress was made with extreme simplicity,
guiltless of flounce or furbelow; it was but the light fabric and
bright tint which scared me, and since Graham found in it nothing
absurd, my own eye consented soon to become reconciled.

<p/>I suppose people who go every night to places of public amusement, can
hardly enter into the fresh gala feeling with which an opera or a
concert is enjoyed by those for whom it is a rarity: I am not sure that
I expected great pleasure from the concert, having but a very vague
notion of its nature, but I liked the drive there well. The snug
comfort of the close carriage on a cold though fine night, the pleasure
of setting out with companions so cheerful and friendly, the sight of
the stars glinting fitfully through the trees as we rolled along the
avenue; then the freer burst of the night-sky when we issued forth to
the open chaussée, the passage through the city gates, the lights there
burning, the guards there posted, the pretence of inspection, to which
we there submitted, and which amused us so much--all these small
matters had for me, in their novelty, a peculiarly exhilarating charm.
How much of it lay in the atmosphere of friendship diffused about me, I
know not: Dr. John and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother were both in their finest mood,
contending animatedly with each other the whole way, and as frankly
kind to me as if I had been of their kin.

<p/>Our way lay through some of the best streets of Villette, streets
brightly lit, and far more lively now than at high noon. How brilliant
seemed the shops! How glad, gay, and abundant flowed the tide of life
along the broad pavement! While I looked, the thought of the Rue
Fossette came across me--of the walled-in garden and school-house, and
of the dark, vast <div class="bookquote">``classes,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>where, as at this very hour, it was my
wont to wander all solitary, gazing at the stars through the high,
blindless windows, and listening to the distant voice of the reader in
the refectory, monotonously exercised upon the <div class="bookquote">``lecture pieuse.''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>Thus
must I soon again listen and wander; and this shadow of the future
stole with timely sobriety across the radiant present.

<p/>By this time we had got into a current of carriages all tending in one
direction, and soon the front of a great illuminated building blazed
before us. Of what I should see within this building, I had, as before
intimated, but an imperfect idea; for no place of public entertainment
had it ever been my lot to enter yet.

<p/>We alighted under a portico where there was a great bustle and a great
crowd, but I do not distinctly remember further details, until I found
myself mounting a majestic staircase wide and easy of ascent, deeply
and softly carpeted with crimson, leading up to great doors closed
solemnly, and whose panels were also crimson-clothed.

<p/>I hardly noticed by what magic these doors were made to roll back--Dr.
John managed these points; roll back they did, however, and within was
disclosed a hall--grand, wide, and high, whose sweeping circular walls,
and domed hollow ceiling, seemed to me all dead gold -LRB-thus with nice
art was it stained-RRB-, relieved by cornicing, fluting, and garlandry,
either bright, like gold burnished, or snow-white, like alabaster, or
white and gold mingled in wreaths of gilded leaves and spotless lilies:
wherever drapery hung, wherever carpets were spread, or cushions
placed, the sole colour employed was deep crimson. Pendent from the
dome, flamed a mass that dazzled me--a mass, I thought, of
rock-crystal, sparkling with facets, streaming with drops, ablaze with
stars, and gorgeously tinged with dews of gems dissolved, or fragments
of rainbows shivered. It was only the chandelier, reader, but for me it
seemed the work of eastern genii: I almost looked to see if a huge,
dark, cloudy hand--that of the Slave of the Lamp--were not hovering in
the lustrous and perfumed atmosphere of the cupola, guarding its
wondrous treasure.

<p/>We moved on--I was not at all conscious whither--but at some turn we
suddenly encountered another party approaching from the opposite
direction. I just now see that group, as it flashed--upon me for one
moment. A handsome middle-aged lady in dark velvet; a gentleman who
might be her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son--the best face, the finest figure, I thought, I had
ever seen; a third person in a pink dress and black lace mantle.

<p/>I noted them all--the third person as well as the other two--and for
the fraction of a moment believed them all strangers, thus receiving an
impartial impression of their appearance. But the impression was hardly
felt and not fixed, before the consciousness that I faced a great
mirror, filling a compartment between two pillars, dispelled it: the
party was our own party. Thus for the first, and perhaps only time in
my life, I enjoyed the <div class="bookquote">``giftie''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>of seeing myself as others see me. No
need to dwell on the result. It brought a jar of discord, a pang of
regret; it was not flattering, yet, after all, I ought to be thankful;
it might have been worse.

<p/>At last, we were seated in places commanding a good general view of
that vast and dazzling, but warm and cheerful hall. Already it was
filled, and filled with a splendid assemblage. I do not know that the
women were very beautiful, but their dresses were so perfect; and
foreigners, even such as are ungraceful in domestic privacy, seem to
posses the art of appearing graceful in public: however blunt and
boisterous those every-day and home movements connected with peignoir
and papillotes, there is a slide, a bend, a carriage of the head and
arms, a mien of the mouth and eyes, kept nicely in reserve for gala
use--always brought out with the grande toilette, and duly put on with
the <div class="bookquote">``parure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>public</b></font>)</div><p/>Some fine forms there were here and there, models of a peculiar style
of beauty; a style, I think, never seen in England; a solid, firm-set,
sculptural style. These shapes have no angles: a caryatid in marble is
almost as flexible; a Phidian goddess is not more perfect in a certain
still and stately sort. They have such features as the Dutch painters
give to their madonnas: low-country classic features, regular but
round, straight but stolid; and for their depth of expressionless calm,
of passionless peace, a polar snow-field could alone offer a type.
Women of this order need no ornament, and they seldom wear any; the
smooth hair, closely braided, supplies a sufficient contrast to the
smoother cheek and brow; the dress cannot be too simple; the rounded
arm and perfect neck require neither bracelet nor chain.

<p/>With one of these beauties I once had the honour and rapture to be
perfectly acquainted: the inert force of the deep, settled love she (<font color='blue'><b>Women</b></font>)
bore herself, was wonderful; it could only be surpassed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Women</b></font>) proud
impotency to care for any other living thing. Of blood, her (<font color='blue'><b>Women</b></font>) cool veins
conducted no flow; placid lymph filled and almost obstructed her (<font color='blue'><b>Women</b></font>)
arteries.

<p/>Such a Juno as I have described sat full in our view--a sort of mark
for all eyes, and quite conscious that so she (<font color='blue'><b>Women</b></font>) was, but proof to the
magnetic influence of gaze or glance: cold, rounded, blonde, and
beauteous as the white column, capitalled with gilding, which rose at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Women</b></font>) side.

<p/>Observing that Dr. John's attention was much drawn towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Women</b></font>), I
entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in a low voice <div class="bookquote">``for the love of heaven to shield well his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)
heart. You need not fall in love with _that_ lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``because, I
tell you beforehand, you might die at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not love
you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and how do you know that the spectacle of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
grand insensibility might not with me be the strongest stimulus to
homage? The sting of desperation is, I think, a wonderful irritant to
my emotions: but''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shoulders-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``you know nothing about
these things; I'll address myself to my mother. Mamma, I'm in a
dangerous way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if that interested me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bretton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! the cruelty of my lot!''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>responded her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``Never man had a more
unsentimental mother than mine: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never seems to think that such a
calamity can befall her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as a daughter-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``If I don't, it is not for want of having that same calamity held over
my head: you have threatened me with it for the last ten years. ``Mamma,
I am going to be married soon!<div class="bookquote">'' was the cry before you were well out of
jackets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, mother, one of these days it will be realized. All of a sudden,
when you think you are most secure, I shall go forth like Jacob or
Esau, or any other patriarch, and take me a wife: perhaps of these
which are of the daughters of the land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At your peril, John Graham! that is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This mother of mine means me to be an old bachelor. What a jealous old
lady it is! But now just look at that splendid creature in the pale
blue satin dress, and hair of paler brown, with `reflets satinés' as
those of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) robe. Would you not feel proud, mamma, if I were to bring
that goddess home some day, and introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) to you as Mrs. Bretton,
junior?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will bring no goddess to La Terrasse: that little château will not
contain two mistresses; especially if the second be of the height,
bulk, and circumference of that mighty doll in wood and wax, and kid

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) would fill your blue chair so admirably!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fill my chair? I defy the foreign usurper! a rueful chair should it be
for her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>): but hush, John Graham! Hold your tongue, and use your eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>During the above skirmish, the hall, which, I had thought, seemed full
at the entrance, continued to admit party after party, until the
semicircle before the stage presented one dense mass of heads, sloping
from floor to ceiling. The stage, too, or rather the wide temporary
platform, larger than any stage, desert half an hour since, was now
overflowing with life; round two grand pianos, placed about the centre,
a white flock of young girls, the pupils of the Conservatoire, had
noiselessly poured. I had noticed their gathering, while Graham and his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
mother were engaged in discussing the belle in blue satin, and had
watched with interest the process of arraying and marshalling them. Two
gentlemen, in each of whom I recognised an acquaintance, officered this
virgin troop. One, an artistic-looking man, bearded, and with long
hair, was a noted pianiste, and also the first music-teacher in
Villette; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attended twice a week at Madame Beck's pensionnat, to give
lessons to the few pupils whose parents were rich enough to allow their
daughters the privilege of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instructions; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was M. Josef
Emanuel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was half-brother to M. Paul: which potent personage was
now visible in the person of the second gentleman.

<p/>M. Paul amused me; I smiled to myself as I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed so
thoroughly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) element--standing conspicuous in presence of a wide
and grand assemblage, arranging, restraining, over-aweing about one
hundred young ladies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was, too, so perfectly in earnest--so
energetic, so intent, and, above all, so absolute: and yet what
business had he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) there? What had he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to do with music or the
Conservatoire--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) who could hardly distinguish one note from another? I
knew that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love of display and authority which had brought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) there--a love not offensive, only because so naive. It presently
became obvious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brother, M. Josef, was as much under his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
control as were the girls themselves. Never was such a little hawk of a
man as that M. Paul! Ere long, some noted singers and musicians dawned
upon the platform: as these stars rose, the comet-like professor set.
Insufferable to him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) were all notorieties and celebrities: where he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>)
could not outshine, he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) fled.

<p/>And now all was prepared: but one compartment of the hall waited to be
filled--a compartment covered with crimson, like the grand staircase
and doors, furnished with stuffed and cushioned benches, ranged on each
side of two regal chairs, placed solemnly under a canopy.

<p/>A signal was given, the doors rolled back, the assembly stood up, the
orchestra burst out, and, to the welcome of a choral burst, enter the
King, the Queen, the Court of Labassecour.

<p/>Till then, I had never set eyes on living king or queen; it may
consequently be conjectured how I strained my powers of vision to take
in these specimens of European royalty. By whomsoever majesty is beheld
for the first time, there will always be experienced a vague surprise
bordering on disappointment, that the same does not appear seated, en
permanence, on a throne, bonneted with a crown, and furnished, as to
the hand, with a sceptre. Looking out for a king and queen, and seeing
only a middle-aged soldier and a rather young lady, I felt half
cheated, half pleased.

<p/>Well do I recall that King--a man of fifty, a little bowed, a little
grey: there was no face in all that assembly which resembled his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). I had
never read, never been told anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) nature or his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) habits; and
at first the strong hieroglyphics graven as with iron stylet on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
brow, round his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) eyes, beside his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mouth, puzzled and baffled instinct.
Ere long, however, if I did not know, at least I felt, the meaning of
those characters written without hand. There sat a silent sufferer--a
nervous, melancholy man. Those eyes had looked on the visits of a
certain ghost--had long waited the comings and goings of that strangest
spectre, Hypochondria. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) now on that stage, over
against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), amidst all that brilliant throng. Hypochondria has that
wont, to rise in the midst of thousands--dark as Doom, pale as Malady,
and well-nigh strong as Death. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) comrade and victim thinks to be
happy one moment--<div class="bookquote">``Not so,''  (<font color='red'><b>victim</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I come.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) freezes the
blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) heart, and beclouds the light in his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Some might say it was the foreign crown pressing the King's brows which
bent them to that peculiar and painful fold; some might quote the
effects of early bereavement. Something there might be of both these;
but these are embittered by that darkest foe of
humanity--constitutional melancholy. The Queen, his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) wife, knew this: it
seemed to me, the reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) husband's grief lay, a subduing
shadow, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) own benignant face. A mild, thoughtful, graceful woman
that princess seemed; not beautiful, not at all like the women of solid
charms and marble feelings described a page or two since. Hers was a
somewhat slender shape; her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) features, though distinguished enough, were
too suggestive of reigning dynasties and royal lines to give
unqualified pleasure. The expression clothing that profile was
agreeable in the present instance; but you could not avoid connecting
it with remembered effigies, where similar lines appeared, under phase
ignoble; feeble, or sensual, or cunning, as the case might be. The
Queen's eye, however, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) own; and pity, goodness, sweet sympathy,
blessed it with divinest light. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) moved no sovereign, but a
lady--kind, loving, elegant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) little son, the Prince of Labassecour,
and young Duc de Dindonneau, accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) leaned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) mother's
knee; and, ever and anon, in the course of that evening, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
observant of the monarch at her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) side, conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) beclouded
abstraction, and desirous to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) from it by drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) attention
to their son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) often bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head to listen to the boy's remarks,
and would then smilingly repeat them to his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) sire. The moody King
started, listened, smiled, but invariably relapsed as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) good
angel ceased speaking. Full mournful and significant was that
spectacle! Not the less so because, both for the aristocracy and the
honest bourgeoisie of Labassecour, its peculiarity seemed to be wholly
invisible: I could not discover that one soul present was either struck
or touched.

<p/>With the King and Queen had entered their court, comprising two or
three foreign ambassadors; and with them came the elite of the
foreigners then resident in Villette. These took possession of the
crimson benches; the ladies were seated; most of the men remained
standing: their sable rank, lining the background, looked like a dark
foil to the splendour displayed in front. Nor was this splendour
without varying light and shade and gradation: the middle distance was
filled with matrons in velvets and satins, in plumes and gems; the
benches in the foreground, to the Queen's right hand, seemed devoted
exclusively to young girls, the flower--perhaps, I should rather say,
the bud--of Villette aristocracy. Here were no jewels, no head-dresses,
no velvet pile or silken sheen purity, simplicity, and aërial grace
reigned in that virgin band. Young heads simply braided, and fair forms
-LRB-I was going to write _sylph_ forms, but that would have been quite
untrue: several of these <div class="bookquote">``jeunes filles,''  (<font color='red'><b>sylph</b></font>)</div>who had not numbered more
than sixteen or seventeen years, boasted contours as robust and solid
as those of a stout Englishwoman of five-and-twenty-RRB---fair forms robed
in white, or pale rose, or placid blue, suggested thoughts of heaven
and angels. I knew a couple, at least, of these <div class="bookquote">``rose et blanche''
 (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div>specimens of humanity. Here was a pair of Madame Beck's late
pupils--Mesdemoiselles Mathilde and Angélique: pupils who, during their
last year at school, ought to have been in the first class, but whose
brains never got them beyond the second division. In English, they had
been under my own charge, and hard work it was to get them to translate
rationally a page of _The Vicar of Wakefield_. Also during three months
I had one of them for my vis-à-vis at table, and the quantity of
household bread, butter, and stewed fruit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) would habitually consume
at <div class="bookquote">``second déjeuner''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was a real world's wonder--to be exceeded only by
the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) actually pocketing slices she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) could not eat. Here be
truths--wholesome truths, too.

<p/>I knew another of these seraphs--the prettiest, or, at any rate, the
least demure and hypocritical looking of the lot: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mathilde</b></font>) was seated by the
daughter of an English peer, also an honest, though haughty-looking
girl: both had entered in the suite of the British embassy. She -LRB-_i.e._
my acquaintance-RRB- had a slight, pliant figure, not at all like the forms
of the foreign damsels: her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair, too, was not close-braided, like a
shell or a skull-cap of satin; it looked _like_ hair, and waved from
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, long, curled, and flowing. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chatted away volubly, and
seemed full of a light-headed sort of satisfaction with herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
position. I did not look at Dr. Bretton; but I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), too, saw
Ginevra Fanshawe: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had become so quiet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) answered so briefly his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
mother's remarks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) so often suppressed a sigh. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) sigh? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
had confessed a taste for the pursuit of love under difficulties; here
was full gratification for that taste. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) lady-love beamed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
from a sphere above his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) could not come near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was not
certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) could win from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a look. I watched to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would so far favour him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>). Our seat was not far from the crimson benches;
we must inevitably be seen thence, by eyes so quick and roving as Miss
Fanshawe's, and very soon those optics of hers were upon us: at least,
upon Dr. and Mrs. Bretton. I kept rather in the shade and out of sight,
not wishing to be immediately recognised: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) looked quite steadily at
Dr. John, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) raised a glass to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother; a minute
or two afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) laughingly whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) neighbour; upon the
performance commencing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) rambling attention was attracted to the
platform.

<p/>On the concert I need not dwell; the reader would not care to have my
impressions thereanent: and, indeed, it would not be worth while to
record them, as they were the impressions of an ignorance crasse. The
young ladies of the Conservatoire, being very much frightened, made
rather a tremulous exhibition on the two grand pianos. M. Josef Emanuel
stood by them while they played; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had not the tact or influence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) kinsman, who, under similar circumstances, would certainly have
_compelled_ pupils of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) to demean themselves with heroism and
self-possession. M. Paul would have placed the hysteric débutantes
between two fires--terror of the audience, and terror of himself--and
would have inspired them with the courage of desperation, by making the
latter terror incomparably the greater: M. Josef could not do this.

<p/>Following the white muslin pianistes, came a fine, full-grown, sulky
lady in white satin. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sang. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) singing just affected me like the
tricks of a conjuror: I wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did it--how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice
run up and down, and cut such marvellous capers; but a simple Scotch
melody, played by a rude street minstrel, has often moved me more
deeply.

<p/>Afterwards stepped forth a gentleman, who, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) body a good deal
in the direction of the King and Queen, and frequently approaching his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
white-gloved hand to the region of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) heart, vented a bitter outcry
against a certain <div class="bookquote">``fausse Isabelle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Queen</b></font>)</div>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) seemed especially to
solicit the Queen's sympathy; but, unless I am egregiously mistaken,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) Majesty lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) attention rather with the calm of courtesy than
the earnestness of interest. This gentleman's state of mind was very
harrowing, and I was glad when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wound up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) musical exposition of
the same.

<p/>Some rousing choruses struck me as the best part of the evening's
entertainment. There were present deputies from all the best provincial
choral societies; genuine, barrel-shaped, native Labassecouriens. These
worthies gave voice without mincing the matter their hearty exertions
had at least this good result--the ear drank thence a satisfying sense
of power.

<p/>Through the whole performance--timid instrumental duets, conceited
vocal solos, sonorous, brass-lunged choruses--my attention gave but one
eye and one ear to the stage, the other being permanently retained in
the service of Dr. Bretton: I could not forget him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), nor cease to
question how he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was feeling, what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was thinking, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was
amused or the contrary. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you like it all, Lucy? You are very quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
own cheerful tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``because I am so very, _very_ much interested:
not merely with the music, but with everything about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) then proceeded to make some further remarks, with so much equanimity
and composure that I began to think he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had really not seen what I had
seen, and I whispered--<div class="bookquote">``Miss Fanshawe is here: have you noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! and I observed that you noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) come with Mrs. Cholmondeley, do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Cholmondeley is there with a very grand party. Yes; Ginevra was
in _her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>)_ train; and Mrs. Cholmondeley was in Lady --'s train, who was
in the Queen's train. If this were not one of the compact little minor
European courts, whose very formalities are little more imposing than
familiarities, and whose gala grandeur is but homeliness in Sunday
array, it would sound all very fine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ginevra saw you, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I think so. I have had my eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) several times since you
withdrew yours; and I have had the honour of witnessing a little
spectacle which you were spared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I did not ask what; I waited voluntary information, which was presently
given.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Fanshawe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``has a companion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)--a lady of rank. I
happen to know Lady Sara by sight; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) noble mother has called me in
professionally. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is a proud girl, but not in the least insolent, and
I doubt whether Ginevra will have gained ground in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) estimation by
making a butt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) neighbours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What neighbours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Merely myself and my mother. As to me it is all very natural: nothing,
I suppose, can be fairer game than the young bourgeois doctor; but my
mother! I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ridiculed before. Do you know, the curling lip,
and sarcastically levelled glass thus directed, gave me a most curious
sensation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think nothing of it, Dr. John: it is not worth while. If Ginevra were
in a giddy mood, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is eminently to-night, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would make no
scruple of laughing at that mild, pensive Queen, or that melancholy
King. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is not actuated by malevolence, but sheer, heedless folly. To
a feather-brained school-girl nothing is sacred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you forget: I have not been accustomed to look on Miss Fanshawe in
the light of a feather-brained school-girl. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not my
divinity--the angel of my career?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hem! There was your mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To speak the honest truth, without any false rant or assumed romance,
there actually was a moment, six months ago, when I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) divine.
Do you remember our conversation about the presents? I was not quite
open with you in discussing that subject: the warmth with which you
took it up amused me. By way of having the full benefit of your lights,
I allowed you to think me more in the dark than I really was. It was
that test of the presents which first proved Ginevra mortal. Still her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
beauty retained its fascination: three days--three hours ago, I was
very much her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) slave. As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passed me to-night, triumphant in beauty,
my emotions did her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) homage; but for one luckless sneer, I should yet be
the humblest of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) servants. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have scoffed at _me_, and,
while wounding, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not soon have alienated me: through myself,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not in ten years have done what, in a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has done
through my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) peace awhile. Never before had I seen so much fire, and so
little sunshine in Dr. John's blue eye as just now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) recommenced, <div class="bookquote">``look well at my mother, and say, without fear
or favour, in what light she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) now appears to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always does--an English, middle-class gentlewoman; well, though
gravely dressed, habitually independent of pretence, constitutionally
composed and cheerful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seems to me--bless her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)! The merry may laugh _with_ mamma, but
the weak only will laugh _at_ her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shall not be ridiculed, with my
consent, at least; nor without my--my scorn--my antipathy--my--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stopped: and it was time--for he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was getting excited--more it seemed
than the occasion warranted. I did not then know that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had witnessed
double cause for dissatisfaction with Miss Fanshawe. The glow of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
complexion, the expansion of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nostril, the bold curve which disdain
gave his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) well-cut under lip, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in a new and striking phase.
Yet the rare passion of the constitutionally suave and serene, is not a
pleasant spectacle; nor did I like the sort of vindictive thrill which
passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) strong young frame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I frighten you, Lucy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell why you are so very angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For this reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) muttered in my ear. <div class="bookquote">``Ginevra is neither a pure
angel, nor a pure-minded woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! you exaggerate: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has no great harm in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too much for me. _I_ can see where _you_ are blind. Now dismiss the
subject. Let me amuse myself by teasing mamma: I will assert that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is flagging. Mamma, pray rouse yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John, I will certainly rouse you if you are not better conducted. Will
you and Lucy be silent, that I may hear the singing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were then thundering in a chorus, under cover of which all the
previous dialogue had taken place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_ hear the singing, mamma! Now, I will wager my studs, which are
genuine, against your paste brooch--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My paste brooch, Graham? Profane boy! you know that it is a stone of
value.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! that is one of your superstitions: you were cheated in the
business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am cheated in fewer things than you imagine. How do you happen to be
acquainted with young ladies of the court, John? I have observed two of
them pay you no small attention during the last half-hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would not observe them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? Because one of them satirically levels her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyeglass at me?
She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a pretty, silly girl: but are you apprehensive that her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) titter
will discomfit the old lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sensible, admirable old lady! Mother, you are better to me than
ten wives yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Don't be demonstrative, John, or I shall faint, and you will have to
carry me out; and if that burden were laid upon you, you would reverse
your last speech, and exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``Mother, ten wives could hardly be worse
to me than you are!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>The concert over, the Lottery <div class="bookquote">``au bénéfice des pauvres''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came next: the
interval between was one of general relaxation, and the pleasantest
imaginable stir and commotion. The white flock was cleared from the
platform; a busy throng of gentlemen crowded it instead, making
arrangements for the drawing; and amongst these--the busiest of
all--re-appeared that certain well-known form, not tall but active,
alive with the energy and movement of three tall men. How M. Paul did
work! How he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) issued directions, and, at the same time, set his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own
shoulder to the wheel! Half-a-dozen assistants were at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) beck to
remove the pianos, &c.; no matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) must add to their strength his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
own. The redundancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) alertness was half-vexing, half-ludicrous:
in my mind I both disapproved and derided most of this fuss. Yet, in
the midst of prejudice and annoyance, I could not, while watching,
avoid perceiving a certain not disagreeable naïveté in all he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did and
said; nor could I be blind to certain vigorous characteristics of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
physiognomy, rendered conspicuous now by the contrast with a throng of
tamer faces: the deep, intent keenness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eye, the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
forehead, pale, broad, and full--the mobility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) most flexible
mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lacked the calm of force, but its movement and its fire he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
signally possessed.

<p/>Meantime the whole hall was in a stir; most people rose and remained
standing, for a change; some walked about, all talked and laughed. The
crimson compartment presented a peculiarly animated scene. The long
cloud of gentlemen, breaking into fragments, mixed with the rainbow
line of ladies; two or three officer-like men approached the King and
conversed with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). The Queen, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) chair, glided along the rank
of young ladies, who all stood up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) passed; and to each in turn I
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) vouchsafe some token of kindness--a gracious word, look or
smile. To the two pretty English girls, Lady Sara and Ginevra Fanshawe,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) addressed several sentences; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) left them, both, and especially
the latter, seemed to glow all over with gratification. They were
afterwards accosted by several ladies, and a little circle of gentlemen
gathered round them; amongst these--the nearest to Ginevra--stood the
Count de Hamal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This room is stiflingly hot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Bretton, rising with sudden
impatience. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy--mother--will you come a moment to the fresh air?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bretton. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather keep my seat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Willingly would I have kept mine also, but Graham's desire must take
precedence of my own; I accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>).

<p/>We found the night-air keen; or at least I did: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) did not seem to feel
it; but it was very still, and the star-sown sky spread cloudless. I
was wrapped in a fur shawl. We took some turns on the pavement; in
passing under a lamp, Graham encountered my eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look pensive, Lucy: is it on my account?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only fearing that you were grieved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all: so be of good cheer--as I am. Whenever I die, Lucy, my
persuasion is that it will not be of heart-complaint. I may be stung, I
may seem to droop for a time, but no pain or malady of sentiment has
yet gone through my whole system. You have always seen me cheerful at
home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Generally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) laughed at my mother. I would not give the old lady for
a dozen beauties. That sneer did me all the good in the world. Thank
you, Miss Fanshawe!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) hat from his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) waved locks, and
made a mock reverence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has made me feel that nine parts in
ten of my heart have always been sound as a bell, and the tenth bled
from a mere puncture: a lancet-prick that will heal in a trice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are angry just now, heated and indignant; you will think and feel
differently to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ heated and indignant! You don't know me. On the contrary, the heat
is gone: I am as cool as the night--which, by the way, may be too cool
for you. We will go back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. John, this is a sudden change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not it: or if it be, there are good reasons for it--two good reasons:
I have told you one. But now let us re-enter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We did not easily regain our seats; the lottery was begun, and all was
excited confusion; crowds blocked the sort of corridor along which we
had to pass: it was necessary to pause for a time. Happening to glance
round--indeed I half fancied I heard my name pronounced--I saw quite
near, the ubiquitous, the inevitable M. Paul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was looking at me
gravely and intently: at me, or rather at my pink dress--sardonic
comment on which gleamed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eye. Now it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) habit to indulge in
strictures on the dress, both of the teachers and pupils, at Madame
Beck's--a habit which the former, at least, held to be an offensive
impertinence: as yet I had not suffered from it--my sombre daily attire
not being calculated to attract notice. I was in no mood to permit any
new encroachment to-night: rather than accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) banter, I would
ignore his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) presence, and accordingly steadily turned my face to the
sleeve of Dr. John's coat; finding in that same black sleeve a prospect
more redolent of pleasure and comfort, more genial, more friendly, I
thought, than was offered by the dark little Professor's unlovely
visage. Dr. John seemed unconsciously to sanction the preference by
looking down and saying in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) kind voice, <div class="bookquote">``Ay, keep close to my side,
Lucy: these crowding burghers are no respecters of persons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not, however, be true to myself. Yielding to some influence,
mesmeric or otherwise--an influence unwelcome, displeasing, but
effective--I again glanced round to see if M. Paul was gone. No, there
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) stood on the same spot, looking still, but with a changed eye; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had penetrated my thought, and read my wish to shun him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). The mocking
but not ill-humoured gaze was turned to a swarthy frown, and when I
bowed, with a view to conciliation, I got only the stiffest and
sternest of nods in return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom have you made angry, Lucy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>whispered Dr. Bretton, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Who
is that savage-looking friend of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of the professors at Madame Beck's: a very cross little man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) looks mighty cross just now: what have you done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)? What is it
all about? Ah, Lucy, Lucy! tell me the meaning of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No mystery, I assure you. M. Emanuel is very exigeant, and because I
looked at your coat-sleeve, instead of curtseying and dipping to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) thinks I have failed in respect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The little--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>began Dr. John: I know not what more he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have
added, for at that moment I was nearly thrown down amongst the feet of
the crowd. M. Paul had rudely pushed past, and was elbowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) way
with such utter disregard to the convenience and security of all
around, that a very uncomfortable pressure was the consequence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) himself would call 'méchant,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Bretton.
I thought so, too.

<p/>Slowly and with difficulty we made our way along the passage, and at
last regained our seats. The drawing of the lottery lasted nearly an
hour; it was an animating and amusing scene; and as we each held
tickets, we shared in the alternations of hope and fear raised by each
turn of the wheel. Two little girls, of five and six years old, drew
the numbers: and the prizes were duly proclaimed from the platform.
These prizes were numerous, though of small value. It so fell out that
Dr. John and I each gained one: mine was a cigar-case, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a lady's
head-dress--a most airy sort of blue and silver turban, with a streamer
of plumage on one side, like a snowy cloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was excessively anxious
to make an exchange; but I could not be brought to hear reason, and to
this day I keep my cigar-case: it serves, when I look at it, to remind
me of old times, and one happy evening.

<p/>Dr. John, for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) part, held his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turban at arm's length between his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
finger and thumb, and looked at it with a mixture of reverence and
embarrassment highly provocative of laughter. The contemplation over,
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was about coolly to deposit the delicate fabric on the ground
between his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) feet; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed to have no shadow of an idea of the
treatment or stowage it ought to receive: if his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother had not come to
the rescue, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would finally have crushed it under his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arm like
an opera-hat; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) restored it to the band-box whence it had issued.

<p/>Graham was quite cheerful all the evening, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) cheerfulness seemed
natural and unforced. His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) demeanour, his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) look, is not easily described;
there was something in it peculiar, and, in its way, original. I read
in it no common mastery of the passions, and a fund of deep and healthy
strength which, without any exhausting effort, bore down Disappointment
and extracted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fang. His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) manner, now, reminded me of qualities I had
noticed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) when professionally engaged amongst the poor, the
guilty, and the suffering, in the Basse-Ville: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) looked at once
determined, enduring, and sweet-tempered. Who could help liking him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)?
_He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)_ betrayed no weakness which harassed all your feelings with
considerations as to how its faltering must be propped; from _him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)_
broke no irritability which startled calm and quenched mirth; _his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)_
lips let fall no caustic that burned to the bone; _his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)_ eye shot no
morose shafts that went cold, and rusty, and venomed through your
heart: beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was rest and refuge--around him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), fostering sunshine.

<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had neither forgiven nor forgotten Miss Fanshawe. Once
angered, I doubt if Dr. Bretton were to be soon propitiated--once
alienated, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) were ever to be reclaimed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) more
than once; not stealthily or humbly, but with a movement of hardy, open
observation. De Hamal was now a fixture beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>); Mrs. Cholmondeley
sat near, and they and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) were wholly absorbed in the discourse,
mirth, and excitement, with which the crimson seats were as much astir
as any plebeian part of the hall. In the course of some apparently
animated discussion, Ginevra once or twice lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) hand and arm; a
handsome bracelet gleamed upon the latter. I saw that its gleam
flickered in Dr. John's eye--quickening therein a derisive, ireful
sparkle; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) laughed:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will lay my turban on my wonted altar of
offerings; there, at any rate, it would be certain to find favour: no
grisette has a more facile faculty of acceptance. Strange! for after
all, I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) is a girl of family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) education, Dr. John,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Tossed about all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) life from one foreign school to another, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) may justly proffer the
plea of ignorance in extenuation of most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) faults. And then, from
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) says, I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) father and mother were brought up much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) has been brought up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always understood she (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had no fortune; and once I had pleasure in the
thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) tells me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, <div class="bookquote">``that they are poor at home; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) always
speaks quite candidly on such points: you never find her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lying, as
these foreigners will often lie. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) parents have a large family: they
occupy such a station and possess such connections as, in their
opinion, demand display; stringent necessity of circumstances and
inherent thoughtlessness of disposition combined, have engendered
reckless unscrupulousness as to how they obtain the means of sustaining
a good appearance. This is the state of things, and the only state of
things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) has seen from childhood upwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it--and I thought to mould her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) to something better: but,
Lucy, to speak the plain truth, I have felt a new thing to-night, in
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and de Hamal. I felt it before noticing the impertinence
directed at my mother. I saw a look interchanged between them
immediately after their entrance, which threw a most unwelcome light on
my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean? You have been long aware of the flirtation they keep
up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, flirtation! That might be an innocent girlish wile to lure on the
true lover; but what I refer to was not flirtation: it was a look
marking mutual and secret understanding--it was neither girlish nor
innocent. No woman, were she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as beautiful as Aphrodite, who could give
or receive such a glance, shall ever be sought in marriage by me: I
would rather wed a paysanne in a short petticoat and high cap--and be
sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was honest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help smiling. I felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now exaggerated the case:
Ginevra, I was certain, was honest enough, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) giddiness. I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) so. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would not be the man to
trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) honour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The only thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``with which you may safely trust her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would unscrupulously damage a husband's purse and property, recklessly
try his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) patience and temper: I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would breathe, or let
another breathe, on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) honour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are becoming her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) advocate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you wish me to resume my
old chains?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No: I am glad to see you free, and trust that free you will long
remain. Yet be, at the same time, just.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so: just as Rhadamanthus, Lucy. When once I am thoroughly
estranged, I cannot help being severe. But look! the King and Queen are
rising. I like that Queen: she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) has a sweet countenance. Mamma, too, is
excessively tired; we shall never get the old lady home if we stay
longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tired, John?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Bretton, looking at least as animated and
as wide-awake as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``I would undertake to sit you out yet: leave
us both here till morning, and we should see which would look the most
jaded by sunrise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not like to try the experiment; for, in truth, mamma, you are
the most unfading of evergreens and the freshest of matrons. It must
then be on the plea of your son's delicate nerves and fragile
constitution that I found a petition for our speedy adjournment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indolent young man! You wish you were in bed, no doubt; and I suppose
you must be humoured. There is Lucy, too, looking quite done up. For
shame, Lucy! At your age, a week of evenings-out would not have made me
a shade paler. Come away, both of you; and you may laugh at the old
lady as much as you please, but, for my part, I shall take charge of
the bandbox and turban.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) did accordingly. I offered to relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), but was shaken off
with kindly contempt: my godmother opined that I had enough to do to
take care of myself. Not standing on ceremony now, in the midst of the
gay <div class="bookquote">``confusion worse confounded''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>succeeding to the King and Queen's
departure, Mrs. Bretton preceded us, and promptly made us a lane
through the crowd. Graham followed, apostrophizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother as the
most flourishing grisette it had ever been his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) good fortune to see
charged with carriage of a bandbox; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) also desired me to mark her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
affection for the sky-blue turban, and announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) conviction that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) intended one day to wear it.

<p/>The night was now very cold and very dark, but with little delay we
found the carriage. Soon we were packed in it, as warm and as snug as
at a fire-side; and the drive home was, I think, still pleasanter than
the drive to the concert. Pleasant it was, even though the
coachman--having spent in the shop of a <div class="bookquote">``marchand de vin''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>a portion of
the time we passed at the concert--drove us along the dark and solitary
chaussée far past the turn leading down to La Terrasse; we, who were
occupied in talking and laughing, not noticing the aberration till, at
last, Mrs. Bretton intimated that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had always thought the
château a retired spot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) did not know it was situated at the world's
end, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) declared seemed now to be the case, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) believed we had
been an hour and a half en route, and had not yet taken the turn down
the avenue.

<p/>Then Graham looked out, and perceiving only dim-spread fields, with
unfamiliar rows of pollards and limes ranged along their else invisible
sunk-fences, began to conjecture how matters were, and calling a halt
and descending, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mounted the box and took the reins himself. Thanks
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), we arrived safe at home about an hour and a half beyond our
time.

<p/>Martha had not forgotten us; a cheerful fire was burning, and a neat
supper spread in the dining-room: we were glad of both. The winter dawn
was actually breaking before we gained our chambers. I took off my pink
dress and lace mantle with happier feelings than I had experienced in
putting them on. Not all, perhaps, who had shone brightly arrayed at
that concert could say the same; for not all had been satisfied with
friendship--with its calm comfort and modest hope.




<p/>CHAPTER XXI.

<p/>REACTION.


<p/>Yet three days, and then I must go back to the _pensionnat_. I almost
numbered the moments of these days upon the clock; fain would I have
retarded their flight; but they glided by while I watched them: they
were already gone while I yet feared their departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy will not leave us to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bretton, coaxingly at
breakfast; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knows we can procure a second respite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not ask for one if I might have it for a word,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I
long to get the good-by over, and to be settled in the Rue Fossette
again. I must go this morning: I must go directly; my trunk is packed
and corded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>It appeared; however, that my going depended upon Graham; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would accompany, me, and it so fell out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was engaged all day,
and only returned home at dusk. Then ensued a little combat of words.
Mrs. Bretton and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) son pressed me to remain one night more. I could
have cried, so irritated and eager was I to be gone. I longed to leave
them as the criminal on the scaffold longs for the axe to descend: that
is, I wished the pang over. How much I wished it, they could not tell.
On these points, mine was a state of mind out of their experience.

<p/>It was dark when Dr. John handed me from the carriage at Madame Beck's
door. The lamp above was lit; it rained a November drizzle, as it had
rained all day: the lamplight gleamed on the wet pavement. Just such a
night was it as that on which, not a year ago, I had first stopped at
this very threshold; just similar was the scene. I remembered the very
shapes of the paving-stones which I had noted with idle eye, while,
with a thick-beating heart, I waited the unclosing of that door at
which I stood--a solitary and a suppliant. On that night, too, I had
briefly met him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) who now stood with me. Had I ever reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) of that
rencontre, or explained it? I had not, nor ever felt the inclination to
do so: it was a pleasant thought, laid by in my own mind, and best kept
there.

<p/>Graham rung the bell. The door was instantly opened, for it was just
that period of the evening when the half-boarders took their
departure--consequently, Rosine was on the alert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I to him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) stepped a moment into the
well-lighted vestibule. I had not wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) to see that <div class="bookquote">``the water
stood in my eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>for his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was too kind a nature ever to be needlessly
shown such signs of sorrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) always wished to heal--to relieve--when,
physician as he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was, neither cure nor alleviation were, perhaps, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
power.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep up your courage, Lucy. Think of my mother and myself as true
friends. We will not forget you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor will I forget you, Dr. John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>My trunk was now brought in. We had shaken hands; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had turned to go,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was not satisfied: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had not done or said enough to content his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
generous impulses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy,'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>--stepping after me--<div class="bookquote">``shall you feel very solitary here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At first I shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my mother will soon call to see you; and, meantime, I'll tell
you what I'll do. I'll write--just any cheerful nonsense that comes
into my head--shall I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good, gallant heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I to myself; but I shook my head,
smiling, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Never think of it: impose on yourself no such task.
_You_ write to _me_!--you'll not have time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I will find or make time. Good-by!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was gone. The heavy door crashed to: the axe had fallen--the pang
was experienced.

<p/>Allowing myself no time to think or feel--swallowing tears as if they
had been wine--I passed to Madame's sitting-room to pay the necessary
visit of ceremony and respect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) received me with perfectly
well-acted cordiality--was even demonstrative, though brief, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
welcome. In ten minutes I was dismissed. From the salle-à-manger I
proceeded to the refectory, where pupils and teachers were now
assembled for evening study: again I had a welcome, and one not, I
think, quite hollow. That over, I was free to repair to the dormitory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And will Graham really write?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I questioned, as I sank tired on the
edge of the bed.

<p/>Reason, coming stealthily up to me through the twilight of that long,
dim chamber, whispered sedately--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) may write once. So kind is his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
nature, it may stimulate him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) for once to make the effort. But it
_cannot_ be continued--it _may_ not be repeated. Great were that folly
which should build on such a promise--insane that credulity which
should mistake the transitory rain-pool, holding in its hollow one
draught, for the perennial spring yielding the supply of seasons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I bent my head: I sat thinking an hour longer. Reason still whispered
me, laying on my shoulder a withered hand, and frostily touching my ear
with the chill blue lips of eld.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>muttered she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) _should_ write, what then? Do you meditate
pleasure in replying? Ah, fool! I warn you! Brief be your answer. Hope
no delight of heart--no indulgence of intellect: grant no expansion to
feeling--give holiday to no single faculty: dally with no friendly
exchange: foster no genial intercommunion...''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have talked to Graham and you did not chide,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I needed not. Talk for you is good discipline. You
converse imperfectly. While you speak, there can be no oblivion of
inferiority--no encouragement to delusion: pain, privation, penury
stamp your language...''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I again broke in, <div class="bookquote">``where the bodily presence is weak and the
speech contemptible, surely there cannot be error in making written
language the medium of better utterance than faltering lips can
achieve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Reason only answered, <div class="bookquote">``At your peril you cherish that idea, or suffer
its influence to animate any writing of yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I feel, may I _never_ express?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Never!_''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>declared Reason.

<p/>I groaned under her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bitter sternness. Never--never--oh, hard word! This
hag, this Reason, would not let me look up, or smile, or hope: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
could not rest unless I were altogether crushed, cowed, broken-in, and
broken-down. According to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), I was born only to work for a piece of
bread, to await the pains of death, and steadily through all life to
despond. Reason might be right; yet no wonder we are glad at times to
defy her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), to rush from under her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rod and give a truant hour to
Imagination--_her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ soft, bright foe, _our_ sweet Help, our divine Hope.
We shall and must break bounds at intervals, despite the terrible
revenge that awaits our return. Reason is vindictive as a devil: for me
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was always envenomed as a step-mother. If I have obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) it has
chiefly been with the obedience of fear, not of love. Long ago I should
have died of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ill-usage her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stint, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chill, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) barren board, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
icy bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) savage, ceaseless blows; but for that kinder Power who
holds my secret and sworn allegiance. Often has Reason turned me out by
night, in mid-winter, on cold snow, flinging for sustenance the gnawed
bone dogs had forsaken: sternly has she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) vowed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stores held nothing
more for me--harshly denied my right to ask better things... Then,
looking up, have I seen in the sky a head amidst circling stars, of
which the midmost and the brightest lent a ray sympathetic and attent.
A spirit, softer and better than Human Reason, has descended with quiet
flight to the waste--bringing all round her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a sphere of air borrowed of
eternal summer; bringing perfume of flowers which cannot
fade--fragrance of trees whose fruit is life; bringing breezes pure
from a world whose day needs no sun to lighten it. My hunger has this
good angel appeased with food, sweet and strange, gathered amongst
gleaning angels, garnering their dew-white harvest in the first fresh
hour of a heavenly day; tenderly has she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) assuaged the insufferable
fears which weep away life itself--kindly given rest to deadly
weariness--generously lent hope and impulse to paralyzed despair.
Divine, compassionate, succourable influence! When I bend the knee to
other than God, it shall be at thy white and winged feet, beautiful on
mountain or on plain. Temples have been reared to the Sun--altars
dedicated to the Moon. Oh, greater glory! To thee neither hands build,
nor lips consecrate: but hearts, through ages, are faithful to thy
worship. A dwelling thou hast, too wide for walls, too high for dome--a
temple whose floors are space--rites whose mysteries transpire in
presence, to the kindling, the harmony of worlds!

<p/>Sovereign complete! thou hadst, for endurance, thy great army of
martyrs; for achievement, thy chosen band of worthies. Deity
unquestioned, thine essence foils decay!

<p/>This daughter of Heaven remembered me to-night; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) saw me weep, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) came with comfort: <div class="bookquote">``Sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Sleep, sweetly--I gild thy
dreams!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) word, and watched me through a night's rest; but at dawn
Reason relieved the guard. I awoke with a sort of start; the rain was
dashing against the panes, and the wind uttering a peevish cry at
intervals; the night-lamp was dying on the black circular stand in the
middle of the dormitory: day had already broken. How I pity those whom
mental pain stuns instead of rousing! This morning the pang of waking
snatched me out of bed like a hand with a giant's gripe. How quickly I
dressed in the cold of the raw dawn! How deeply I drank of the ice-cold
water in my carafe! This was always my cordial, to which, like other
dram-drinkers, I had eager recourse when unsettled by chagrin.

<p/>Ere long the bell rang its _réveillée_ to the whole school. Being
dressed, I descended alone to the refectory, where the stove was lit
and the air was warm; through the rest of the house it was cold, with
the nipping severity of a continental winter: though now but the
beginning of November, a north wind had thus early brought a wintry
blight over Europe: I remember the black stoves pleased me little when
I first came; but now I began to associate with them a sense of
comfort, and liked them, as in England we like a fireside.

<p/>Sitting down before this dark comforter, I presently fell into a deep
argument with myself on life and its chances, on destiny and her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
decrees. My mind, calmer and stronger now than last night, made for
itself some imperious rules, prohibiting under deadly penalties all
weak retrospect of happiness past; commanding a patient journeying
through the wilderness of the present, enjoining a reliance on faith--a
watching of the cloud and pillar which subdue while they guide, and awe
while they illumine--hushing the impulse to fond idolatry, checking the
longing out-look for a far-off promised land whose rivers are, perhaps,
never to be, reached save in dying dreams, whose sweet pastures are to
be viewed but from the desolate and sepulchral summit of a Nebo.

<p/>By degrees, a composite feeling of blended strength and pain wound
itself wirily round my heart, sustained, or at least restrained, its
throbbings, and made me fit for the day's work. I lifted my head.

<p/>As I said before, I was sitting near the stove, let into the wall
beneath the refectory and the carré, and thus sufficing to heat both
apartments. Piercing the same wall, and close beside the stove, was a
window, looking also into the carré; as I looked up a cap-tassel, a
brow, two eyes, filled a pane of that window; the fixed gaze of those
two eyes hit right against my own glance: they were watching me. I had
not till that moment known that tears were on my cheek, but I felt them
now.

<p/>This was a strange house, where no corner was sacred from intrusion,
where not a tear could be shed, nor a thought pondered, but a spy was
at hand to note and to divine. And this new, this out-door, this male
spy, what business had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) to the premises at this unwonted
hour? What possible right had he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) to intrude on me thus? No other
professor would have dared to cross the carré before the class-bell
rang. M. Emanuel took no account of hours nor of claims: there was some
book of reference in the first-class library which he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had occasion to
consult; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had come to seek it: on his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) way he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) passed the refectory. It
was very much his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) habit to wear eyes before, behind, and on each side
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had seen me through the little window--he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) now opened the
refectory door, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) stood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle, vous êtes triste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, j'en ai bien le droit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vous êtes malade de coeur et d'humeur,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) pursued. <div class="bookquote">``You are at once
mournful and mutinous. I see on your cheek two tears which I know are
hot as two sparks, and salt as two crystals of the sea. While I speak
you eye me strangely. Shall I tell you of what I am reminded while
watching you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, I shall be called away to prayers shortly; my time for
conversation is very scant and brief at this hour--excuse--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I excuse everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) interrupted; <div class="bookquote">``my mood is so meek, neither
rebuff nor, perhaps, insult could ruffle it. You remind me, then, of a
young she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wild creature, new caught, untamed, viewing with a mixture of
fire and fear the first entrance of the breaker-in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Unwarrantable accost!--rash and rude if addressed to a pupil; to a
teacher inadmissible. He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) thought to provoke a warm reply; I had seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) vex the passionate to explosion before now. In me his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) malice should
find no gratification; I sat silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>), ``like one who would snatch at a draught of sweet
poison, and spurn wholesome bitters with disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I never liked bitters; nor do I believe them wholesome. And to
whatever is sweet, be it poison or food, you cannot, at least, deny its
own delicious quality--sweetness. Better, perhaps, to die quickly a
pleasant death, than drag on long a charmless life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you should take your bitter dose duly and daily, if I
had the power to administer it; and, as to the well-beloved poison, I
would, perhaps, break the very cup which held it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I sharply turned my head away, partly because his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) presence utterly
displeased me, and partly because I wished to shun questions: lest, in
my present mood, the effort of answering should overmaster self-command.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>), more softly, <div class="bookquote">``tell me the truth--you grieve at being
parted from friends--is it not so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The insinuating softness was not more acceptable than the inquisitorial
curiosity. I was silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) came into the room, sat down on the bench
about two yards from me, and persevered long, and, for him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>), patiently,
in attempts to draw me into conversation--attempts necessarily
unavailing, because I _could_ not talk. At last I entreated to be let
alone. In uttering the request, my voice faltered, my head sank on my
arms and the table. I wept bitterly, though quietly. He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) sat a while
longer. I did not look up nor speak, till the closing door and his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>)
retreating step told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) was gone. These tears proved a relief.

<p/>I had time to bathe my eyes before breakfast, and I suppose I appeared
at that meal as serene as any other person: not, however, quite as
jocund-looking as the young lady who placed herself in the seat
opposite mine, fixed on me a pair of somewhat small eyes twinkling
gleefully, and frankly stretched across the table a white hand to be
shaken. Miss Fanshawe's travels, gaieties, and flirtations agreed with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) mightily; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had become quite plump, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) cheeks looked as round as
apples. I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) last in elegant evening attire. I don't know
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) looked less charming now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) school-dress, a kind of
careless peignoir of a dark-blue material, dimly and dingily plaided
with black. I even think this dusky wrapper gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) charms a triumph;
enhancing by contrast the fairness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) skin, the freshness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
bloom, the golden beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) tresses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you are come back, Timon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>). Timon was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
dozen names for me. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know how often I have wanted you in this
dismal hole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, have you? Then, of course, if you wanted me, you have something
for me to do: stockings to mend, perhaps.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I never gave Ginevra a
minute's or a farthing's credit for disinterestedness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Crabbed and crusty as ever!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I expected as much: it would
not be you if you did not snub one. But now, come, grand-mother, I hope
you like coffee as much, and pistolets as little as ever: are you
disposed to barter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take your own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This way consisted in a habit she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) had of making me convenient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) did
not like the morning cup of coffee; its school brewage not being strong
or sweet enough to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) palate; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) had an excellent appetite,
like any other healthy school-girl, for the morning pistolets or rolls,
which were new-baked and very good, and of which a certain allowance
was served to each. This allowance being more than I needed, I gave
half to Ginevra; never varying in my preference, though many others
used to covet the superfluity; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) in return would sometimes give
me a portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) coffee. This morning I was glad of the draught;
hunger I had none, and with thirst I was parched. I don't know why I
chose to give my bread rather to Ginevra than to another; nor why, if
two had to share the convenience of one drinking-vessel, as sometimes
happened--for instance, when we took a long walk into the country, and
halted for refreshment at a farm--I always contrived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) should be
my convive, and rather liked to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) take the lion's share, whether
of the white beer, the sweet wine, or the new milk: so it was, however,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) knew it; and, therefore, while we wrangled daily, we were never
alienated.

<p/>After breakfast my custom was to withdraw to the first classe, and sit
and read, or think -LRB-oftenest the latter-RRB- there alone, till the
nine-o'clock bell threw open all doors, admitted the gathered rush of
externes and demi-pensionnaires, and gave the signal for entrance on
that bustle and business to which, till five P.M., there was no relax.

<p/>I was just seated this morning, when a tap came to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon, Mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said a pensionnaire, entering gently; and
having taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) desk some necessary book or paper, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) withdrew
on tip-toe, murmuring as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) passed me, <div class="bookquote">``Que mademoiselle est
appliquée!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Appliquée, indeed! The means of application were spread before me, but
I was doing nothing; and had done nothing, and meant to do nothing.
Thus does the world give us credit for merits we have not. Madame Beck
herself deemed me a regular bas-bleu, and often and solemnly used to
warn me not to study too much, lest <div class="bookquote">``the blood should all go to my
head.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Indeed, everybody in the Rue Fossette held a superstition that
<div class="bookquote">``Meess Lucie''  (<font color='red'><b>Rue Fossette</b></font>)</div>was learned; with the notable exception of M. Emanuel,
who, by means peculiar to himself, and quite inscrutable to me, had
obtained a not inaccurate inkling of my real qualifications, and used
to take quiet opportunities of chuckling in my ear his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) malign glee over
their scant measure. For my part, I never troubled myself about this
penury. I dearly like to think my own thoughts; I had great pleasure in
reading a few books, but not many: preferring always those on whose
style or sentiment the writer's individual nature was plainly stamped;
flagging inevitably over characterless books, however clever and
meritorious: perceiving well that, as far as my own mind was concerned,
God had limited its powers and, its action--thankful, I trust, for the
gift bestowed, but unambitious of higher endowments, not restlessly
eager after higher culture.

<p/>The polite pupil was scarcely gone, when, unceremoniously, without tap,
in burst a second intruder. Had I been blind I should have known who
this was. A constitutional reserve of manner had by this time told with
wholesome and, for me, commodious effect, on the manners of my
co-inmates; rarely did I now suffer from rude or intrusive treatment.
When I first came, it would happen once and again that a blunt German
would clap me on the shoulder, and ask me to run a race; or a riotous
Labassecourienne seize me by the arm and drag me towards the
playground: urgent proposals to take a swing at the <div class="bookquote">``Pas de Géant,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>or
to join in a certain romping hide-and-seek game called <div class="bookquote">``Un, deux,
trois,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>were formerly also of hourly occurrence; but all these little
attentions had ceased some time ago--ceased, too, without my finding it
necessary to be at the trouble of point-blank cutting them short. I had
now no familiar demonstration to dread or endure, save from one
quarter; and as that was English I could bear it. Ginevra Fanshawe made
no scruple of--at times--catching me as I was crossing the carré,
whirling me round in a compulsory waltz, and heartily enjoying the
mental and physical discomfiture her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) proceeding induced. Ginevra
Fanshawe it was who now broke in upon <div class="bookquote">``my learned leisure.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginevra/Miss Fanshawe/Ginevra Fanshawe</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) carried
a huge music-book under her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to your practising,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) at once: <div class="bookquote">``away with you to the
little salon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till I have had a talk with you, chère amie. I know where you have
been spending your vacation, and how you have commenced sacrificing to
the graces, and enjoying life like any other belle. I saw you at the
concert the other night, dressed, actually, like anybody else. Who is
your tailleuse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tittle-tattle: how prettily it begins! My tailleuse!--a fiddlestick!
Come, sheer off, Ginevra. I really don't want your company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when I want yours so much, ange farouche, what does a little
reluctance on your part signify? Dieu merci! we know how to manoeuvre

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know John Bretton.''

me about him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). The poor man must be in a sad way. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say to my
behaviour the other night? Wasn't I cruel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Sara never quizzed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) at all; and for what _you_ did, don't make

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assented; <div class="bookquote">``as mad as a March hare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how _ever_ did you get him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How _ever_, indeed! Have you no pity on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) poor mother and me? Fancy
us holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) tight down in the carriage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) raving between us,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you it is fact--and fact, also, that Dr. Bretton would _not_

it is of no use dwelling at length on the harrowing details. Suffice it
to say, that never, in the most stormy fits and moments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) infancy,
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mother such work to tuck the sheets about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had that

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And I opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have not told me all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better not wait until I _do_ tell you all. Such extra

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cross thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) obeyed: and, indeed, the first classe
was my territory, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) could not there legally resist a notice of
quittance from me.

<p/>Yet, to speak the truth, never had I been less dissatisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
than I was then. There was pleasure in thinking of the contrast between
the reality and my description--to remember Dr. John enjoying the drive
home, eating his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) supper with relish, and retiring to rest with
Christian composure. It was only when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) really unhappy that I
felt really vexed with the fair, frail cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) suffering.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>A fortnight passed; I was getting once more inured to the harness of
school, and lapsing from the passionate pain of change to the palsy of
custom. One afternoon, in crossing the carré, on my way to the first
classe, where I was expected to assist at a lesson of <div class="bookquote">``style and
literature,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I saw, standing by one of the long and large windows,
Rosine, the portress. Her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) attitude, as usual, was quite nonchalante.
She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) always <div class="bookquote">``stood at ease;''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>one of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hands rested in her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
apron-pocket, the other at this moment held to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes a letter,
whereof Mademoiselle coolly perused the address, and deliberately
studied the seal.

<p/>A letter! The shape of a letter similar to that had haunted my brain in
its very core for seven days past. I had dreamed of a letter last
night. Strong magnetism drew me to that letter now; yet, whether I
should have ventured to demand of Rosine so much as a glance at that
white envelope, with the spot of red wax in the middle, I know not. No;
I think I should have sneaked past in terror of a rebuff from
Disappointment: my heart throbbed now as if I already heard the tramp
of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) approach. Nervous mistake! It was the rapid step of the
Professor of Literature measuring the corridor. I fled before him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).
Could I but be seated quietly at my desk before his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) arrival, with the
class under my orders all in disciplined readiness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) would, perhaps,
exempt me from notice; but, if caught lingering in the carré, I should
be sure to come in for a special harangue. I had time to get seated, to
enforce perfect silence, to take out my work, and to commence it amidst
the profoundest and best trained hush, ere M. Emanuel entered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
vehement burst of latch and panel, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) deep, redundant bow,
prophetic of choler.

<p/>As usual he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) broke upon us like a clap of thunder; but instead of
flashing lightning-wise from the door to the estrade, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) career halted
midway at my desk. Setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) face towards me and the window, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) back
to the pupils and the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) gave me a look--such a look as might
have licensed me to stand straight up and demand what he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) meant--a look
of scowling distrust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Voilà! pour vous,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) waist-coat, and
placing on my desk a letter--the very letter I had seen in Rosine's
hand--the letter whose face of enamelled white and single Cyclop's-eye
of vermilion-red had printed themselves so clear and perfect on the
retina of an inward vision. I knew it, I felt it to be the letter of my
hope, the fruition of my wish, the release from my doubt, the ransom
from my terror. This letter M. Paul, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) unwarrantably interfering
habits, had taken from the portress, and now delivered it himself.

<p/>I might have been angry, but had not a second for the sensation. Yes: I
held in my hand not a slight note, but an envelope, which must, at
least, contain a sheet: it felt not flimsy, but firm, substantial,
satisfying. And here was the direction, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Lucy Snowe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in a clean,
clear, equal, decided hand; and here was the seal, round, full, deftly
dropped by untremulous fingers, stamped with the well-cut impress of
initials, <div class="bookquote">``J. G. B.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I experienced a happy feeling--a glad emotion
which went warm to my heart, and ran lively through all my veins. For
once a hope was realized. I held in my hand a morsel of real solid joy:
not a dream, not an image of the brain, not one of those shadowy
chances imagination pictures, and on which humanity starves but cannot
live; not a mess of that manna I drearily eulogized awhile ago--which,
indeed, at first melts on the lips with an unspeakable and
preternatural sweetness, but which, in the end, our souls full surely
loathe; longing deliriously for natural and earth-grown food, wildly
praying Heaven's Spirits to reclaim their own spirit-dew and
essence--an aliment divine, but for mortals deadly. It was neither
sweet hail nor small coriander-seed--neither slight wafer, nor luscious
honey, I had lighted on; it was the wild, savoury mess of the hunter,
nourishing and salubrious meat, forest-fed or desert-reared, fresh,
healthful, and life-sustaining. It was what the old dying patriarch
demanded of his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) son Esau, promising in requital the blessing of his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>)
last breath. It was a godsend; and I inwardly thanked the God who had
vouchsafed it. Outwardly I only thanked man, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank
you, Monsieur!''

 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur curled his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) lip, gave me a vicious glance of the eye, and
strode to his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) estrade. M. Paul was not at all a good little man, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had good points.

<p/>Did I read my letter there and then? Did I consume the venison at once
and with haste, as if Esau's shaft flew every day?

<p/>I knew better. The cover with its address--the seal, with its three
clear letters--was bounty and abundance for the present. I stole from
the room, I procured the key of the great dormitory, which was kept
locked by day. I went to my bureau; with a sort of haste and trembling
lest Madame should creep up-stairs and spy me, I opened a drawer,
unlocked a box, and took out a case, and--having feasted my eyes with
one more look, and approached the seal with a mixture of awe and shame
and delight, to my lips--I folded the untasted treasure, yet all fair
and inviolate, in silver paper, committed it to the case, shut up box
and drawer, reclosed, relocked the dormitory, and returned to class,
feeling as if fairy tales were true, and fairy gifts no dream. Strange,
sweet insanity! And this letter, the source of my joy, I had not yet
read: did not yet know the number of its lines.

<p/>When I re-entered the schoolroom, behold M. Paul raging like a
pestilence! Some pupil had not spoken audibly or distinctly enough to
suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ear and taste, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) and others were weeping, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
raving from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) estrade, almost livid. Curious to mention, as I
appeared, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fell on me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was I the mistress of these girls? Did I profess to teach them the
conduct befitting ladies?--and did I permit and, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) doubted not,
encourage them to strangle their mother-tongue in their throats, to
mince and mash it between their teeth, as if they had some base cause
to be ashamed of the words they uttered? Was this modesty? He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) knew
better. It was a vile pseudo sentiment--the offspring or the forerunner
of evil. Rather than submit to this mopping and mowing, this mincing
and grimacing, this, grinding of a noble tongue, this general
affectation and sickening stubbornness of the pupils of the first
class, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would throw them up for a set of insupportable petites
maîtresses, and confine himself to teaching the ABC to the babies of
the third division.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>What could I say to all this? Really nothing; and I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would
allow me to be silent. The storm recommenced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) queries was then refused? It seemed to be
considered in _that_ place--that conceited boudoir of a first classe,
with its pretentious book-cases, its green-baized desks, its rubbish of
flower-stands, its trash of framed pictures and maps, and its foreign
surveillante, forsooth!--it seemed to be the fashion to think _there_
that the Professor of Literature was not worthy of a reply! These were
new ideas; imported, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) did not doubt, straight from `la Grande
Bretagne:' they savoured of island insolence and arrogance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>Lull the second--the girls, not one of whom was ever known to weep a
tear for the rebukes of any other master, now all melting like
snow-statues before the intemperate heat of M. Emanuel: I not yet much
shaken, sitting down, and venturing to resume my work.

<p/>Something--either in my continued silence or in the movement of my
hand, stitching--transported M. Emanuel beyond the last boundary of
patience; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) actually sprang from his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) estrade. The stove stood near my
desk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) attacked it; the little iron door was nearly dashed from its
hinges, the fuel was made to fly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Est-ce que vous avez l'intention de m`insulter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) to me, in a
low, furious voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) thus outraged, under pretence of arranging
the fire.

<p/>It was time to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) a little if possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais, Monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I would not insult you for the world. I
remember too well that you once said we should be friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I did not intend my voice to falter, but it did: more, I think, through
the agitation of late delight than in any spasm of present fear. Still
there certainly was something in M. Paul's anger--a kind of passion of
emotion--that specially tended to draw tears. I was not unhappy, nor
much afraid, yet I wept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allons, allons!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) presently, looking round and seeing the
deluge universal. <div class="bookquote">``Decidedly I am a monster and a ruffian. I have only
one pocket-handkerchief,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``but if I had twenty, I would offer
you each one. Your teacher shall be your representative. Here, Miss
Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took forth and held out to me a clean silk handkerchief. Now a
person who did not know M. Paul, who was unused to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
impulses, would naturally have bungled at this offer--declined
accepting the same--et cetera. But I too plainly felt this would never
do: the slightest hesitation would have been fatal to the incipient
treaty of peace. I rose and met the handkerchief half-way, received it
with decorum, wiped therewith my eyes, and, resuming my seat, and
retaining the flag of truce in my hand and on my lap, took especial
care during the remainder of the lesson to touch neither needle nor
thimble, scissors nor muslin. Many a jealous glance did M. Paul cast at
these implements; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hated them mortally, considering sewing a source
of distraction from the attention due to himself. A very eloquent
lesson he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave, and very kind and friendly was he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to the close. Ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had done, the clouds were dispersed and the sun shining out--tears were
exchanged for smiles.

<p/>In quitting the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) paused once more at my desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), this time not quite fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not yet read it, Monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! it is too good to read at once; you save it, as, when I was a boy,
I used to save a peach whose bloom was very ripe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The guess came so near the truth, I could not prevent a suddenly-rising
warmth in my face from revealing as much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You promise yourself a pleasant moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in reading that
letter; you will open it when alone--n'est-ce pas? Ah! a smile answers.
Well, well! one should not be too harsh; `la jeunesse n'a qu'un temps.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, Monsieur!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, or rather whispered after him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
turned to go, <div class="bookquote">``do not leave me under a mistake. This is merely a
friend's letter. Without reading it, I can vouch for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Je conçois, je conçois: on sait ce que c'est qu'un ami. Bonjour,
Mademoiselle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Monsieur, here is your handkerchief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep it, keep it, till the letter is read, then bring it me; I shall
read the billet's tenor in your eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was gone, the pupils having already poured out of the
schoolroom into the berceau, and thence into the garden and court to
take their customary recreation before the five-o'clock dinner, I stood
a moment thinking, and absently twisting the handkerchief round my arm.
For some reason--gladdened, I think, by a sudden return of the golden
glimmer of childhood, roused by an unwonted renewal of its buoyancy,
made merry by the liberty of the closing hour, and, above all, solaced
at heart by the joyous consciousness of that treasure in the case, box,
drawer up-stairs,--I fell to playing with the handkerchief as if it
were a ball, casting it into the air and catching it--as it fell. The
game was stopped by another hand than mine--a hand emerging from a
paletôt-sleeve and stretched over my shoulder; it caught the
extemporised plaything and bore it away with these sullen words:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Je vois bien que vous vous moquez de moi et de mes effets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>that man</b></font>)</div><p/>Really that little man was dreadful: a mere sprite of caprice and,
ubiquity: one never knew either his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whim or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whereabout.




<p/>CHAPTER XXII.

<p/>THE LETTER.


<p/>When all was still in the house; when dinner was over and the noisy
recreation-hour past; when darkness had set in, and the quiet lamp of
study was lit in the refectory; when the externes were gone home, the
clashing door and clamorous bell hushed for the evening; when Madame
was safely settled in the salle-à-manger in company with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother and
some friends; I then glided to the kitchen, begged a bougie for one
half-hour for a particular occasion, found acceptance of my petition at
the hands of my friend Goton, who answered, <div class="bookquote">``Mais certainement,
chou-chou, vous en aurez deux, si vous voulez;''  (<font color='red'><b>Goton</b></font>)</div>and, light in hand, I
mounted noiseless to the dormitory.

<p/>Great was my chagrin to find in that apartment a pupil gone to bed
indisposed,--greater when I recognised, amid the muslin nightcap
borders, the <div class="bookquote">``figure chiffonnée''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>of Mistress Ginevra Fanshawe; supine
at this moment, it is true--but certain to wake and overwhelm me with
chatter when the interruption would be least acceptable: indeed, as I
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), a slight twinkling of the eyelids warned me that the
present appearance of repose might be but a ruse, assumed to cover sly
vigilance over <div class="bookquote">``Timon's''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>movements; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was not to be trusted. And I
had so wished to be alone, just to read my precious letter in peace.

<p/>Well, I must go to the classes. Having sought and found my prize in its
casket, I descended. Ill-luck pursued me. The classes were undergoing
sweeping and purification by candle-light, according to hebdomadal
custom: benches were piled on desks, the air was dim with dust, damp
coffee-grounds -LRB-used by Labassecourien housemaids instead of
tea-leaves-RRB- darkened the floor; all was hopeless confusion. Baffled,
but not beaten, I withdrew, bent as resolutely as ever on finding
solitude _somewhere_.

<p/>Taking a key whereof I knew the repository, I mounted three staircases
in succession, reached a dark, narrow, silent landing, opened a
worm-eaten door, and dived into the deep, black, cold garret. Here none
would follow me--none interrupt--not Madame herself. I shut the
garret-door; I placed my light on a doddered and mouldy chest of
drawers; I put on a shawl, for the air was ice-cold; I took my letter;
trembling with sweet impatience, I broke its seal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be long--will it be short?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I, passing my hand across
my eyes to dissipate the silvery dimness of a suave, south-wind shower.

<p/>It was long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be cool?--will it be kind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was kind.

<p/>To my checked, bridled, disciplined expectation, it seemed very kind:
to my longing and famished thought it seemed, perhaps, kinder than it
was.

<p/>So little had I hoped, so much had I feared; there was a fulness of
delight in this taste of fruition--such, perhaps, as many a human being
passes through life without ever knowing. The poor English teacher in
the frosty garret, reading by a dim candle guttering in the wintry air,
a letter simply good-natured--nothing more; though that good-nature
then seemed to me godlike--was happier than most queens in palaces.

<p/>Of course, happiness of such shallow origin could be but brief; yet,
while it lasted it was genuine and exquisite: a bubble--but a sweet
bubble--of real honey-dew. Dr. John had written to me at length; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had
written to me with pleasure; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had written with benignant mood,
dwelling with sunny satisfaction on scenes that had passed before his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
eyes and mine,--on places we had visited together--on conversations we
had held--on all the little subject-matter, in short, of the last few
halcyon weeks. But the cordial core of the delight was, a conviction
the blithe, genial language generously imparted, that it had been
poured out not merely to content _me_--but to gratify _himself_. A
gratification he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might never more desire, never more seek--an
hypothesis in every point of view approaching the certain; but _that_
concerned the future. This present moment had no pain, no blot, no
want; full, pure, perfect, it deeply blessed me. A passing seraph
seemed to have rested beside me, leaned towards my heart, and reposed
on its throb a softening, cooling, healing, hallowing wing. Dr. John,
you pained me afterwards: forgiven be every ill--freely forgiven--for
the sake of that one dear remembered good!

<p/>Are there wicked things, not human, which envy human bliss? Are there
evil influences haunting the air, and poisoning it for man? What was
near me?

<p/>Something in that vast solitary garret sounded strangely. Most surely
and certainly I heard, as it seemed, a stealthy foot on that floor: a
sort of gliding out from the direction of the black recess haunted by
the malefactor cloaks. I turned: my light was dim; the room was
long--but as I live! I saw in the middle of that ghostly chamber a
figure all black and white; the skirts straight, narrow, black; the
head bandaged, veiled, white.

<p/>Say what you will, reader--tell me I was nervous or mad; affirm that I
was unsettled by the excitement of that letter; declare that I dreamed;
this I vow--I saw there--in that room--on that night--an image like--a
NUN.

<p/>I cried out; I sickened. Had the shape approached me I might have
swooned. It receded: I made for the door. How I descended all the
stairs I know not. By instinct I shunned the refectory, and shaped my
course to Madame's sitting-room: I burst in. I said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something in the grenier; I have been there: I saw something.
Go and look at it, all of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said, <div class="bookquote">``All of you;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>for the room seemed to me full of people, though
in truth there were but four present: Madame Beck; her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother, Madame
Kint, who was out of health, and now staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) on a visit; her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
brother, M. Victor Kint, and another gentleman, who, when I entered the
room, was conversing with the old lady, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Kint</b></font>) back towards the
door.

<p/>My mortal fear and faintness must have made me deadly pale. I felt cold
and shaking. They all rose in consternation; they surrounded me. I
urged them to go to the grenier; the sight of the gentlemen did me good
and gave me courage: it seemed as if there were some help and hope,
with men at hand. I turned to the door, beckoning them to follow. They
wanted to stop me, but I said they must come this way: they must see
what I had seen--something strange, standing in the middle of the
garret. And, now, I remembered my letter, left on the drawers with the
light. This precious letter! Flesh or spirit must be defied for its
sake. I flew up-stairs, hastening the faster as I knew I was followed:
they were obliged to come.

<p/>Lo! when I reached the garret-door, all within was dark as a pit: the
light was out. Happily some one--Madame, I think, with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) usual calm
sense--had brought a lamp from the room; speedily, therefore, as they
came up, a ray pierced the opaque blackness. There stood the bougie
quenched on the drawers; but where was the letter? And I looked for
_that_ now, and not for the nun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My letter! my letter!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I panted and plained, almost beside myself. I
groped on the floor, wringing my hands wildly. Cruel, cruel doom! To
have my bit of comfort preternaturally snatched from me, ere I had well
tasted its virtue!

<p/>I don't know what the others were doing; I could not watch them: they
asked me questions I did not answer; they ransacked all corners; they
prattled about this and that disarrangement of cloaks, a breach or
crack in the sky-light--I know not what. <div class="bookquote">``Something or somebody has
been here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was sagely averred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! they have taken my letter!''  (<font color='red'><b>monomaniac</b></font>)</div>cried the grovelling, groping,
monomaniac.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What letter, Lucy? My dear girl, what letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked a known voice in
my ear. Could I believe that ear? No: and I looked up. Could I trust my
eyes? Had I recognised the tone? Did I now look on the face of the
writer of that very letter? Was this gentleman near me in this dim
garret, John Graham--Dr. Bretton himself?

<p/>Yes: it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had been called in that very evening to prescribe for
some access of illness in old Madame Kint; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was the second gentleman
present in the salle-à-manger when I entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it _my_ letter, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your own: yours--the letter you wrote to me. I had come here to read
it quietly. I could not find another spot where it was possible to have
it to myself. I had saved it all day--never opened it till this
evening: it was scarcely glanced over: I _cannot bear_ to lose it. Oh,
my letter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! don't cry and distress yourself so cruelly. What is it worth?
Hush! Come out of this cold room; they are going to send for the police
now to examine further: we need not stay here--come, we will go down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>A warm hand, taking my cold fingers, led me down to a room where there
was a fire. Dr. John and I sat before the stove. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) talked to me and
soothed me with unutterable goodness, promising me twenty letters for
the one lost. If there are words and wrongs like knives, whose
deep-inflicted lacerations never heal--cutting injuries and insults of
serrated and poison-dripping edge--so, too, there are consolations of
tone too fine for the ear not fondly and for ever to retain their echo:
caressing kindnesses--loved, lingered over through a whole life,
recalled with unfaded tenderness, and answering the call with undimmed
shine, out of that raven cloud foreshadowing Death himself. I have been
told since that Dr. Bretton was not nearly so perfect as I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>):
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) actual character lacked the depth, height, compass, and
endurance it possessed in my creed. I don't know: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was as good to me
as the well is to the parched wayfarer--as the sun to the shivering
jailbird. I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>) heroic. Heroic at this moment will I hold him (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>)
to be.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>) asked me, smiling, why I cared for his (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>) letter so very much. I
thought, but did not say, that I prized it like the blood in my veins.
I only answered that I had so few letters to care for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you did not read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``or you would think nothing
of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I read it, but only once. I want to read it again. I am sorry it is
lost.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I could not help weeping afresh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, Lucy, my poor little god-sister -LRB-if there be such a
relationship-RRB-, here--_here_ is your letter. Why is it not better worth
such tears, and such tenderly exaggerating faith?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Curious, characteristic manoeuvre! His (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>) quick eye had seen the letter on
the floor where I sought it; his (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>) hand, as quick, had snatched it up. He (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>)
had hidden it in his (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>) waistcoat pocket. If my trouble had wrought with a
whit less stress and reality, I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>jailbird</b></font>) would ever have
acknowledged or restored it. Tears of temperature one degree cooler
than those I shed would only have amused Dr. John.

<p/>Pleasure at regaining made me forget merited reproach for the teasing
torment; my joy was great; it could not be concealed: yet I think it
broke out more in countenance than language. I said little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you satisfied now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>asked Dr. John.

<p/>I replied that I was--satisfied and happy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) proceeded, <div class="bookquote">``how do you feel physically? Are you growing
calmer? Not much: for you tremble like a leaf still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to me, however, that I was sufficiently calm: at least I felt
no longer terrified. I expressed myself composed.

<p/>``You are able, consequently, to tell me what you saw? Your account was
quite vague, do you know? You looked white as the wall; but you only
spoke of ``something,<div class="bookquote">'' not defining _what_. Was it a man? Was it an
animal? What was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never will tell exactly what I saw,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``unless some one else
sees it too, and then I will give corroborative testimony; but
otherwise, I shall be discredited and accused of dreaming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Bretton; <div class="bookquote">``I will hear it in my professional
character: I look on you now from a professional point of view, and I
read, perhaps, all you would conceal--in your eye, which is curiously
vivid and restless: in your cheek, which the blood has forsaken; in
your hand, which you cannot steady. Come, Lucy, speak and tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would laugh--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't tell me you shall have no more letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are laughing now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will again take away that single epistle: being mine, I think I have
a right to reclaim it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt raillery in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) words: it made me grave and quiet; but I folded
up the letter and covered it from sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may hide it, but I can possess it any moment I choose. You don't
know my skill in sleight of hand; I might practise as a conjuror if I
liked. Mamma says sometimes, too, that I have a harmonizing property of
tongue and eye; but you never saw that in me--did you, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed--indeed--when you were a mere boy I used to see both: far more
then than now--for now you are strong, and strength dispenses with
subtlety. But still,--Dr. John, you have what they call in this country
`un air fin,''  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>that nobody can, mistake. Madame Beck saw it, and--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And liked it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Beck/Beck</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>), laughing, <div class="bookquote">``because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has it herself. But,
Lucy, give me that letter--you don't really care for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To this provocative speech I made no answer. Graham in mirthful mood
must not be humoured too far. Just now there was a new sort of smile
playing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) lips--very sweet, but it grieved me somehow--a new
sort of light sparkling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eyes: not hostile, but not reassuring. I
rose to go--I bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) good-night a little sadly.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) sensitiveness--that peculiar, apprehensive, detective faculty of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)--felt in a moment the unspoken complaint--the scarce-thought
reproach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) asked quietly if I was offended. I shook my head as
implying a negative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Permit me, then, to speak a little seriously to you before you go. You
are in a highly nervous state. I feel sure from what is apparent in
your look and manner, however well controlled, that whilst alone this
evening in that dismal, perishing sepulchral garret--that dungeon under
the leads, smelling of damp and mould, rank with phthisis and catarrh:
a place you never ought to enter--that you saw, or _thought_ you saw,
some appearance peculiarly calculated to impress the imagination. I
know that you _are_ not, nor ever were, subject to material terrors,
fears of robbers, &c.--I am not so sure that a visitation, bearing a
spectral character, would not shake your very mind. Be calm now. This
is all a matter of the nerves, I see: but just specify the vision.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will tell nobody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody--most certainly. You may trust me as implicitly as you did Père
Silas. Indeed, the doctor is perhaps the safer confessor of the two,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) has not grey hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not laugh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I may, to do you good: but not in scorn. Lucy, I feel as a
friend towards you, though your timid nature is slow to trust.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) now looked like a friend: that indescribable smile and sparkle were
gone; those formidable arched curves of lip, nostril, eyebrow, were
depressed; repose marked his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) attitude--attention sobered his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) aspect.
Won to confidence, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) exactly what I had seen: ere now I had
narrated to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) the legend of the house--whiling away with that
narrative an hour of a certain mild October afternoon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) and I
rode through Bois l``Etang.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sat and thought, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought, we heard them all coming
down-stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they going to interrupt?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bois</b></font>), glancing at the door with an
annoyed expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They will not come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered; for we were in the little salon
where Madame never sat in the evening, and where it was by mere chance
that heat was still lingering in the stove. They passed the door and
went on to the salle-à-manger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bois</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``they will talk about thieves, burglars, and so on:
let them do so--mind you say nothing, and keep your resolution of
describing your nun to nobody. She (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) may appear to you again: don't
start.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, with secret horror, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) came out of my
brain, and is now gone in there, and may glide out again at an hour and
a day when I look not for her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it a case of spectral illusion: I fear, following on and
resulting from long-continued mental conflict.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Doctor John--I shudder at the thought of being liable to such an
illusion! It seemed so real. Is there no cure?--no preventive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happiness is the cure--a cheerful mind the preventive: cultivate both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>No mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being
told to _cultivate_ happiness. What does such advice mean? Happiness is
not a potato, to be planted in mould, and tilled with manure. Happiness
is a glory shining far down upon us out of Heaven. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is a divine dew
which the soul, on certain of its summer mornings, feels dropping upon
it from the amaranth bloom and golden fruitage of Paradise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cultivate happiness!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said briefly to the doctor: <div class="bookquote">``do _you_
cultivate happiness? How do you manage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a cheerful fellow by nature: and then ill-luck has never dogged
me. Adversity gave me and my mother one passing scowl and brush, but we
defied her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), or rather laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went by.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no cultivation in all this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not give way to melancholy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: I have seen you subdued by that feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Ginevra Fanshawe--eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) not sometimes make you miserable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! stuff! nonsense! You see I am better now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If a laughing eye with a lively light, and a face bright with beaming
and healthy energy, could attest that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was better, better he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
certainly was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not look much amiss, or greatly out of condition,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I allowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why, Lucy, can't you look and feel as I do--buoyant, courageous,
and fit to defy all the nuns and flirts in Christendom? I would give
gold on the spot just to see you snap your fingers. Try the manoeuvre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were to bring Miss Fanshawe into your presence just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I vow, Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should not move me: or, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should move me but by one
thing--true, yes, and passionate love. I would accord forgiveness at no
less a price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! a smile of hers would have been a fortune to you a while
since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Transformed, Lucy: transformed! Remember, you once called me a slave!
but I am a free man now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stood up: in the port of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head, the carriage of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) figure, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) beaming eye and mien, there revealed itself a liberty which was
more than ease--a mood which was disdain of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) past bondage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Fanshawe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``has led me through a phase of feeling
which is over: I have entered another condition, and am now much

she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a pretty nun? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a pretty face? You have not told me that yet;
and _that_ is the really important point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had a white cloth over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes glittered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) goblin trappings!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), irreverently: <div class="bookquote">``but at

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cold and fixed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply.

you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought it too kind and cordial for a ghost to stand: and so was the

 (<font color='red'><b>a ghost</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>And had there been anything in the garret? What did they discover? I
believe, on the closest examination, their discoveries amounted to very
little. They talked, at first, of the cloaks being disturbed; but
Madame Beck told me afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) thought they hung much as usual: and
as for the broken pane in the skylight, she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) affirmed that aperture was
rarely without one or more panes broken or cracked: and besides, a
heavy hail-storm had fallen a few days ago. Madame questioned me very
closely as to what I had seen, but I only described an obscure figure
clothed in black: I took care not to breathe the word <div class="bookquote">``nun,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>certain
that this word would at once suggest to her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mind an idea of romance and
unreality. She (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) charged me to say nothing on the subject to any servant,
pupil, or teacher, and highly commended my discretion in coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
private salle-à-manger, instead of carrying the tale of horror to the
school refectory. Thus the subject dropped. I was left secretly and
sadly to wonder, in my own mind, whether that strange thing was of this
world, or of a realm beyond the grave; or whether indeed it was only
the child of malady, and I of that malady the prey.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIII.

<p/>VASHTI.


<p/>To wonder sadly, did I say? No: a new influence began to act upon my
life, and sadness, for a certain space, was held at bay. Conceive a
dell, deep-hollowed in forest secresy; it lies in dimness and mist: its
turf is dank, its herbage pale and humid. A storm or an axe makes a
wide gap amongst the oak-trees; the breeze sweeps in; the sun looks
down; the sad, cold dell becomes a deep cup of lustre; high summer
pours her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) blue glory and her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) golden light out of that beauteous sky,
which till now the starved hollow never saw.

<p/>A new creed became mine--a belief in happiness.

<p/>It was three weeks since the adventure of the garret, and I possessed
in that case, box, drawer up-stairs, casketed with that first letter,
four companions like to it, traced by the same firm pen, sealed with
the same clear seal, full of the same vital comfort. Vital comfort it
seemed to me then: I read them in after years; they were kind letters
enough--pleasing letters, because composed by one well pleased; in the
two last there were three or four closing lines half-gay, half-tender,
<div class="bookquote">``by _feeling_ touched, but not subdued.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Time, dear reader, mellowed
them to a beverage of this mild quality; but when I first tasted their
elixir, fresh from the fount so honoured, it seemed juice of a divine
vintage: a draught which Hebe might fill, and the very gods approve.

<p/>Does the reader, remembering what was said some pages back, care to ask
how I answered these letters: whether under the dry, stinting check of
Reason, or according to the full, liberal impulse of Feeling?

<p/>To speak truth, I compromised matters; I served two masters: I bowed
down in the houses of Rimmon, and lifted the heart at another shrine. I
wrote to these letters two answers--one for my own relief, the other
for Graham's perusal.

<p/>To begin with: Feeling and I turned Reason out of doors, drew against
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bar and bolt, then we sat down, spread our paper, dipped in the ink
an eager pen, and, with deep enjoyment, poured out our sincere heart.
When we had done--when two sheets were covered with the language of a
strongly-adherent affection, a rooted and active gratitude---LRB-once, for
all, in this parenthesis, I disclaim, with the utmost scorn, every
sneaking suspicion of what are called <div class="bookquote">``warmer feelings:''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>women do not
entertain these <div class="bookquote">``warmer feelings''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>where, from the commencement, through
the whole progress of an acquaintance, they have never once been
cheated of the conviction that, to do so would be to commit a mortal
absurdity: nobody ever launches into Love unless he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has seen or dreamed
the rising of Hope's star over Love's troubled waters-RRB---when, then, I
had given expression to a closely-clinging and deeply-honouring
attachment--an attachment that wanted to attract to itself and take to
its own lot all that was painful in the destiny of its object; that
would, if it could, have absorbed and conducted away all storms and
lightnings from an existence viewed with a passion of solicitude--then,
just at that moment, the doors of my heart would shake, bolt and bar
would yield, Reason would leap in vigorous and revengeful, snatch the
full sheets, read, sneer, erase, tear up, re-write, fold, seal, direct,
and send a terse, curt missive of a page. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did right.

<p/>I did not live on letters only: I was visited, I was looked after; once
a week I was taken out to La Terrasse; always I was made much of. Dr.
Bretton failed not to tell me _why_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was so kind: <div class="bookquote">``To keep away the
nun,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was determined to dispute with her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) prey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had
taken,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) declared, <div class="bookquote">``a thorough dislike to her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>), chiefly on account of
that white face-cloth, and those cold grey eyes: the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heard of
those odious particulars,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) affirmed, <div class="bookquote">``consummate disgust had incited
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to oppose her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was determined to try whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) was the
cleverest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) only wished she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) would once more look in upon me when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was present:''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but _that_ she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never did. In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) regarded me
scientifically in the light of a patient, and at once exercised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
professional skill, and gratified his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) natural benevolence, by a course
of cordial and attentive treatment.

<p/>One evening, the first in December, I was walking by myself in the
carré; it was six o'clock; the classe-doors were closed; but within,
the pupils, rampant in the licence of evening recreation, were
counterfeiting a miniature chaos. The carré was quite dark, except a
red light shining under and about the stove; the wide glass-doors and
the long windows were frosted over; a crystal sparkle of starlight,
here and there spangling this blanched winter veil, and breaking with
scattered brilliance the paleness of its embroidery, proved it a clear
night, though moonless. That I should dare to remain thus alone in
darkness, showed that my nerves were regaining a healthy tone: I
thought of the nun, but hardly feared her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>); though the staircase was
behind me, leading up, through blind, black night, from landing to
landing, to the haunted grenier. Yet I own my heart quaked, my pulse
leaped, when I suddenly heard breathing and rustling, and turning, saw
in the deep shadow of the steps a deeper shadow still--a shape that
moved and descended. It paused a while at the classe-door, and then it
glided before me. Simultaneously came a clangor of the distant
door-bell. Life-like sounds bring life-like feelings: this shape was
too round and low for my gaunt nun: it was only Madame Beck on duty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosine</b></font>)</div>cried Rosine, bursting in, lamp in hand, from the
corridor, <div class="bookquote">``on est là pour vous au salon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosine</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame saw me, I saw Madame, Rosine saw us both: there was no mutual
recognition. I made straight for the salon. There I found what I own I
anticipated I should find--Dr. Bretton; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was in evening-dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The carriage is at the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); ``my mother has sent it to take
you to the theatre; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was going herself, but an arrival has prevented
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) immediately said, ``Take Lucy in my place.<div class="bookquote">'' Will you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Lucy Snowe/Miss Snowe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now? I am not dressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I, glancing despairingly at my dark
merino.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have half an hour to dress. I should have given you notice, but I
only determined on going since five o'clock, when I heard there was to
be a genuine regale in the presence of a great actress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mentioned a name that thrilled me--a name that, in those days,
could thrill Europe. It is hushed now: its once restless echoes are all
still; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) who bore it went years ago to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) rest: night and oblivion
long since closed above her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); but _then_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) day--a day of Sirius--stood
at its full height, light and fervour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go; I will be ready in ten minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I vowed. And away I flew,
never once checked, reader, by the thought which perhaps at this moment
checks you: namely, that to go anywhere with Graham and without Mrs.
Bretton could be objectionable. I could not have conceived, much less
have expressed to Graham, such thought--such scruple--without risk of
exciting a tyrannous self-contempt: of kindling an inward fire of shame
so quenchless, and so devouring, that I think it would soon have licked
up the very life in my veins. Besides, my godmother, knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) son,
and knowing me, would as soon have thought of chaperoning a sister with
a brother, as of keeping anxious guard over our incomings and outgoings.

<p/>The present was no occasion for showy array; my dun mist crape would
suffice, and I sought the same in the great oak-wardrobe in the
dormitory, where hung no less than forty dresses. But there had been
changes and reforms, and some innovating hand had pruned this same
crowded wardrobe, and carried divers garments to the grenier--my crape
amongst the rest. I must fetch it. I got the key, and went aloft
fearless, almost thoughtless. I unlocked the door, I plunged in. The
reader may believe it or not, but when I thus suddenly entered, that
garret was not wholly dark as it should have been: from one point there
shone a solemn light, like a star, but broader. So plainly it shone,
that it revealed the deep alcove with a portion of the tarnished
scarlet curtain drawn over it. Instantly, silently, before my eyes, it
vanished; so did the curtain and alcove: all that end of the garret
became black as night. I ventured no research; I had not time nor will;
snatching my dress, which hung on the wall, happily near the door, I
rushed out, relocked the door with convulsed haste, and darted
downwards to the dormitory.

<p/>But I trembled too much to dress myself: impossible to arrange hair or
fasten hooks-and-eyes with such fingers, so I called Rosine and bribed
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to help me. Rosine liked a bribe, so she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) best, smoothed and
plaited my hair as well as a coiffeur would have done, placed the lace
collar mathematically straight, tied the neck-ribbon accurately--in
short, did her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) work like the neat-handed Phillis she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could be when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
chose. Having given me my handkerchief and gloves, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took the candle
and lighted me down-stairs. After all, I had forgotten my shawl; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
ran back to fetch it; and I stood with Dr. John in the vestibule,
waiting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this, Lucy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), looking down at me narrowly. <div class="bookquote">``Here is
the old excitement. Ha! the nun again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I utterly denied the charge: I was vexed to be suspected of a
second illusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was sceptical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) has been, as sure as I live,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) figure crossing your
eyes leaves on them a peculiar gleam and expression not to be mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) has _not_ been,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I persisted: for, indeed, I could deny her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
apparition with truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old symptoms are there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) affirmed: <div class="bookquote">``a particular pale, and what
the Scotch call a `raised' look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was so obstinate, I thought it better to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) what I really
_had_ seen. Of course with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) it was held to be another effect of the
same cause: it was all optical illusion--nervous malady, and so on. Not
one bit did I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); but I dared not contradict: doctors are so
self-opinionated, so immovable in their dry, materialist views.

<p/>Rosine brought the shawl, and I was bundled into the carriage.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>The theatre was full--crammed to its roof: royal and noble were there:
palace and hotel had emptied their inmates into those tiers so thronged
and so hushed. Deeply did I feel myself privileged in having a place
before that stage; I longed to see a being of whose powers I had heard
reports which made me conceive peculiar anticipations. I wondered if
she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) would justify her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) renown: with strange curiosity, with feelings
severe and austere, yet of riveted interest, I waited. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was a study
of such nature as had not encountered my eyes yet: a great and new
planet she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was: but in what shape? I waited her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) rising.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) rose at nine that December night: above the horizon I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) come.
She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) could shine yet with pale grandeur and steady might; but that star
verged already on its judgment-day. Seen near, it was a chaos--hollow,
half-consumed: an orb perished or perishing--half lava, half glow.

<p/>I had heard this woman termed <div class="bookquote">``plain,''  (<font color='red'><b>this woman</b></font>)</div>and I expected bony harshness
and grimness--something large, angular, sallow. What I saw was the
shadow of a royal Vashti: a queen, fair as the day once, turned pale
now like twilight, and wasted like wax in flame.

<p/>For awhile--a long while--I thought it was only a woman, though an
unique woman, who moved in might and grace before this multitude.
By-and-by I recognised my mistake. Behold! I found upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) something
neither of woman nor of man: in each of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes sat a devil. These
evil forces bore her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) through the tragedy, kept up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feeble
strength--for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was but a frail creature; and as the action rose and
the stir deepened, how wildly they shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with their passions of the
pit! They wrote HELL on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) straight, haughty brow. They tuned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
voice to the note of torment. They writhed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) regal face to a demoniac
mask. Hate and Murder and Madness incarnate she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood.

<p/>It was a marvellous sight: a mighty revelation.

<p/>It was a spectacle low, horrible, immoral.

<p/>Swordsmen thrust through, and dying in their blood on the arena sand;
bulls goring horses disembowelled, made a meeker vision for the
public--a milder condiment for a people's palate--than Vashti torn by
seven devils: devils which cried sore and rent the tenement they
haunted, but still refused to be exorcised.

<p/>Suffering had struck that stage empress; and she (<font color='blue'><b>empress</b></font>) stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>empress</b></font>)
audience neither yielding to, nor enduring, nor, in finite measure,
resenting it: she (<font color='blue'><b>empress</b></font>) stood locked in struggle, rigid in resistance. She (<font color='blue'><b>empress</b></font>)
stood, not dressed, but draped in pale antique folds, long and regular
like sculpture. A background and entourage and flooring of deepest
crimson threw her (<font color='blue'><b>empress</b></font>) out, white like alabaster--like silver: rather, be it
said, like Death.

<p/>Where was the artist of the Cleopatra? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) come and sit down and
study this different vision. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) seek here the mighty brawn, the
muscle, the abounding blood, the full-fed flesh he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) worshipped: let all
materialists draw nigh and look on.

<p/>I have said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) does not _resent_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) grief. No; the weakness of
that word would make it a lie. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>), what hurts becomes immediately
embodied: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) looks on it as a thing that can be attacked, worried
down, torn in shreds. Scarcely a substance herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) grapples to
conflict with abstractions. Before calamity she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) is a tigress; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) rends
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) woes, shivers them in convulsed abhorrence. Pain, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>), has no
result in good: tears water no harvest of wisdom: on sickness, on death
itself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) looks with the eye of a rebel. Wicked, perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) is, but
also she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) is strong; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) strength has conquered Beauty, has overcome
Grace, and bound both at her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) side, captives peerlessly fair, and docile
as fair. Even in the uttermost frenzy of energy is each maenad movement
royally, imperially, incedingly upborne. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) hair, flying loose in
revel or war, is still an angel's hair, and glorious under a halo.
Fallen, insurgent, banished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) remembers the heaven where she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>)
rebelled. Heaven's light, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) exile, pierces its confines,
and discloses their forlorn remoteness.

<p/>Place now the Cleopatra, or any other slug, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) as an obstacle,
and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) cut through the pulpy mass as the scimitar of Saladin clove
the down cushion. Let Paul Peter Rubens wake from the dead, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Rubens</b></font>)
rise out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rubens</b></font>) cerements, and bring into this presence all the army of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rubens</b></font>) fat women; the magian power or prophet-virtue gifting that slight
rod of Moses, could, at one waft, release and re-mingle a sea
spell-parted, whelming the heavy host with the down-rush of overthrown
sea-ramparts.

<p/>Vashti was not good, I was told; and I have said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) did not look good:
though a spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) was a spirit out of Tophet. Well, if so much of
unholy force can arise from below, may not an equal efflux of sacred
essence descend one day from above?

<p/>What thought Dr. Graham of this being?

<p/>For long intervals I forgot to look how he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) demeaned himself, or to
question what he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) thought. The strong magnetism of genius drew my heart
out of its wonted orbit; the sunflower turned from the south to a
fierce light, not solar--a rushing, red, cometary light--hot on vision
and to sensation. I had seen acting before, but never anything like
this: never anything which astonished Hope and hushed Desire; which
outstripped Impulse and paled Conception; which, instead of merely
irritating imagination with the thought of what _might_ be done, at the
same time fevering the nerves because it was _not_ done, disclosed
power like a deep, swollen winter river, thundering in cataract, and
bearing the soul, like a leaf, on the steep and steelly sweep of its
descent.

<p/>Miss Fanshawe, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) usual ripeness of judgment, pronounced Dr.
Bretton a serious, impassioned man, too grave and too impressible. Not
in such light did I ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>): no such faults could I lay to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
charge. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) natural attitude was not the meditative, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) natural
mood the sentimental; _impressionable_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was as dimpling water, but,
almost as water, _unimpressible:_ the breeze, the sun, moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)--metal
could not grave, nor fire brand.

<p/>Dr. John _could_ think and think well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was rather a man of
action than of thought; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) _could_ feel, and feel vividly in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart had no chord for enthusiasm: to bright, soft, sweet
influences his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes and lips gave bright, soft, sweet welcome,
beautiful to see as dyes of rose and silver, pearl and purple, imbuing
summer clouds; for what belonged to storm, what was wild and intense,
dangerous, sudden, and flaming, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had no sympathy, and held with it no
communion. When I took time and regained inclination to glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),
it amused and enlightened me to discover that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was watching that
sinister and sovereign Vashti, not with wonder, nor worship, nor yet
dismay, but simply with intense curiosity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) agony did not pain him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wild moan--worse than a shriek--did not much move him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fury
revolted him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) somewhat, but not to the point of horror. Cool young
Briton! The pale cliffs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) own England do not look down on the
tides of the Channel more calmly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) watched the Pythian
inspiration of that night.

<p/>Looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) face, I longed to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) exact opinions, and at last I
put a question tending to elicit them. At the sound of my voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>)
awoke as if out of a dream; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) had been thinking, and very intently
thinking, his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) own thoughts, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) own manner. <div class="bookquote">``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) like
Vashti?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wished to know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hm-m-m,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was the first scarce articulate but expressive answer; and
then such a strange smile went wandering round his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) lips, a smile so
critical, so almost callous! I suppose that for natures of that order
his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) sympathies _were_ callous. In a few terse phrases he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) told me his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>)
opinion of, and feeling towards, the actress: he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) judged her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) as a woman,
not an artist: it was a branding judgment.

<p/>That night was already marked in my book of life, not with white, but
with a deep-red cross. But I had not done with it yet; and other
memoranda were destined to be set down in characters of tint indelible.

<p/>Towards midnight, when the deepening tragedy blackened to the
death-scene, and all held their breath, and even Graham bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
under-lip, and knit his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) brow, and sat still and struck--when the whole
theatre was hushed, when the vision of all eyes centred in one point,
when all ears listened towards one quarter--nothing being seen but the
white form sunk on a seat, quivering in conflict with her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) last, her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
worst-hated, her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) visibly-conquering foe--nothing heard but her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) throes,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) gaspings, breathing yet of mutiny, panting still defiance; when, as
it seemed, an inordinate will, convulsing a perishing mortal frame,
bent it to battle with doom and death, fought every inch of ground,
sold every drop of blood, resisted to the latest the rape of every
faculty, _would_ see, _would_ hear, _would_ breathe, _would_ live, up
to, within, well-nigh _beyond_ the moment when death says to all sense
and all being--<div class="bookquote">``Thus far and no farther!'' (<font color='red'><b>every faculty</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Just then a stir, pregnant with omen, rustled behind the scenes--feet
ran, voices spoke. What was it? demanded the whole house. A flame, a
smell of smoke replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fire!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rang through the gallery. <div class="bookquote">``Fire!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was repeated, re-echoed,
yelled forth: and then, and faster than pen can set it down, came
panic, rushing, crushing--a blind, selfish, cruel chaos.

<p/>And Dr. John? Reader, I see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) yet, with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) look of comely courage
and cordial calm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy will sit still, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), glancing down at me with the
same serene goodness, the same repose of firmness that I have seen in
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) when sitting at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) side amid the secure peace of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother's
hearth. Yes, thus adjured, I think I would have sat still under a
rocking crag: but, indeed, to sit still in actual circumstances was my
instinct; and at the price of my very life, I would not have moved to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) trouble, thwart his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will, or make demands on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) attention. We
were in the stalls, and for a few minutes there was a most terrible,
ruthless pressure about us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How terrified are the women!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but if the men were not almost
equally so, order might be maintained. This is a sorry scene: I see
fifty selfish brutes at this moment, each of whom, if I were near, I
could conscientiously knock down. I see some women braver than some
men. There is one yonder--Good God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While Graham was speaking, a young girl who had been very quietly and
steadily clinging to a gentleman before us, was suddenly struck from
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) protector's arms by a big, butcherly intruder, and hurled under the
feet of the crowd. Scarce two seconds lasted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) disappearance. Graham
rushed forwards; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) and the gentleman, a powerful man though
grey-haired, united their strength to thrust back the throng; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head
and long hair fell back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) shoulder: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed unconscious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with me; I am a medical man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Dr. John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have no lady with you, be it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer. <div class="bookquote">``Hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),
and I will force a passage: we must get her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to the air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Graham; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will be neither hindrance nor
incumbrance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) summoned me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eye: we were separated. Resolute, however, to
rejoin him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), I penetrated the living barrier, creeping under where I
could not get between or over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fasten on me, and don't leave go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said; and I obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>).

<p/>Our pioneer proved strong and adroit; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) opened the dense mass like a
wedge; with patience and toil he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) at last bored through the
flesh-and-blood rock--so solid, hot, and suffocating--and brought us to
the fresh, freezing night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an Englishman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), turning shortly on Dr. Bretton, when
we got into the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An Englishman. And I speak to a countryman?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right. Be good enough to stand here two minutes, whilst I find my
carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I am not hurt,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a girlish voice; <div class="bookquote">``am I with papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are with a friend, and your father is close at hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I am not hurt, except just in my shoulder. Oh, my shoulder!
They trod just here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dislocation, perhaps!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>muttered the Doctor: <div class="bookquote">``let us hope there is no
worse injury done. Lucy, lend a hand one instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>And I assisted while he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) made some arrangement of drapery and position
for the ease of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) suffering burden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) suppressed a moan, and lay in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) arms quietly and patiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is very light,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Graham, <div class="bookquote">``like a child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) asked in my
ear, <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) a child, Lucy? Did you notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) age?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not a child--I am a person of seventeen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div>responded the patient,
demurely and with dignity. Then, directly after: <div class="bookquote">``Tell papa to come; I
get anxious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The carriage drove up; her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) father relieved Graham; but in the exchange
from one bearer to another she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was hurt, and moaned again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father, tenderly; then turning to Graham, <div class="bookquote">``You
said, sir, you are a medical man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am: Dr. Bretton, of La Terrasse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. Will you step into my carriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My own carriage is here: I will seek it, and accompany you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be pleased, then, to follow us.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) named his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) address: <div class="bookquote">``The Hôtel
Crécy, in the Rue Crécy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We followed; the carriage drove fast; myself and Graham were silent.
This seemed like an adventure.

<p/>Some little time being lost in seeking our own equipage, we reached the
hotel perhaps about ten minutes after these strangers. It was an hotel
in the foreign sense: a collection of dwelling-houses, not an inn--a
vast, lofty pile, with a huge arch to its street-door, leading through
a vaulted covered way, into a square all built round.

<p/>We alighted, passed up a wide, handsome public staircase, and stopped
at Numéro 2 on the second landing; the first floor comprising the abode
of I know not what <div class="bookquote">``prince Russe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as Graham informed me. On ringing
the bell at a second great door, we were admitted to a suite of very
handsome apartments. Announced by a servant in livery, we entered a
drawing-room whose hearth glowed with an English fire, and whose walls
gleamed with foreign mirrors. Near the hearth appeared a little group:
a slight form sunk in a deep arm-chair, one or two women busy about it,
the iron-grey gentleman anxiously looking on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Harriet? I wish Harriet would come to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the girlish
voice, faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Mrs. Hurst?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>demanded the gentleman impatiently and somewhat
sternly of the man-servant who had admitted us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) is gone out of town, sir; my young lady gave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
leave till to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I did--I did. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is gone to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister; I said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might go:
I remember now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>interposed the young lady; <div class="bookquote">``but I am so sorry, for
Manon and Louison cannot understand a word I say, and they hurt me
without meaning to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. John and the gentleman now interchanged greetings; and while they
passed a few minutes in consultation, I approached the easy-chair, and
seeing what the faint and sinking girl wished to have done, I did it
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>I was still occupied in the arrangement, when Graham drew near; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was
no less skilled in surgery than medicine, and, on examination, found
that no further advice than his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) own was necessary to the treatment of
the present case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be carried to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chamber, and
whispered to me:--<div class="bookquote">``Go with the women, Lucy; they seem but dull; you can
at least direct their movements, and thus spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) some pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) must
be touched very tenderly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The chamber was a room shadowy with pale-blue hangings, vaporous with
curtainings and veilings of muslin; the bed seemed to me like
snow-drift and mist--spotless, soft, and gauzy. Making the women stand
apart, I undressed their mistress, without their well-meaning but
clumsy aid. I was not in a sufficiently collected mood to note with
separate distinctness every detail of the attire I removed, but I
received a general impression of refinement, delicacy, and perfect
personal cultivation; which, in a period of after-thought, offered in
my reflections a singular contrast to notes retained of Miss Ginevra
Fanshawe's appointments.

<p/>The girl was herself a small, delicate creature, but made like a model.
As I folded back her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) plentiful yet fine hair, so shining and soft, and
so exquisitely tended, I had under my observation a young, pale, weary,
but high-bred face. The brow was smooth and clear; the eyebrows were
distinct, but soft, and melting to a mere trace at the temples; the
eyes were a rich gift of nature--fine and full, large, deep, seeming to
hold dominion over the slighter subordinate features--capable,
probably, of much significance at another hour and under other
circumstances than the present, but now languid and suffering. Her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) skin
was perfectly fair, the neck and hands veined finely like the petals of
a flower; a thin glazing of the ice of pride polished this delicate
exterior, and her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) lip wore a curl--I doubt not inherent and
unconscious, but which, if I had seen it first with the accompaniments
of health and state, would have struck me as unwarranted, and proving
in the little lady a quite mistaken view of life and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own
consequence.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) demeanour under the Doctor's hands at first excited a smile; it was
not puerile--rather, on the whole, patient and firm--but yet, once or
twice she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) with suddenness and sharpness, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and must contrive to give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) less pain; I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) large
eyes, too, settle on his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) face like the solemn eyes of some pretty,
wondering child. I know not whether Graham felt this examination: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was cautious not to check or discomfort it by any retaliatory
look. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) performed his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) work with extreme care and gentleness,
sparing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) what pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) could; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) acknowledged as much, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
had done, by the words:--<div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Doctor, and good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>very
gratefully pronounced as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) uttered them, however, it was with a
repetition of the serious, direct gaze, I thought, peculiar in its
gravity and intentness.

<p/>The injuries, it seems, were not dangerous: an assurance which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
father received with a smile that almost made one his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friend--it was so
glad and gratified. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) obligations to Graham with as
much earnestness as was befitting an Englishman addressing one who has
served him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), but is yet a stranger; he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) also begged him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to call the next
day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said a voice from the veiled couch, <div class="bookquote">``thank the lady, too; is
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I opened the curtain with a smile, and looked in at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lay now at
comparative ease; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked pretty, though pale; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face was
delicately designed, and if at first sight it appeared proud, I believe
custom might prove it to be soft.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank the lady very sincerely,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father: <div class="bookquote">``I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has
been very good to my child. I think we scarcely dare tell Mrs. Hurst
who has been her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) substitute and done her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) work; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) will feel at once
ashamed and jealous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>And thus, in the most friendly spirit, parting greetings were
interchanged; and refreshment having been hospitably offered, but by
us, as it was late, refused, we withdrew from the Hôtel Crécy.

<p/>On our way back we repassed the theatre. All was silence and darkness:
the roaring, rushing crowd all vanished and gone--the damps, as well as
the incipient fire, extinct and forgotten. Next morning's papers
explained that it was but some loose drapery on which a spark had
fallen, and which had blazed up and been quenched in a moment.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIV.

<p/>M. DE BASSOMPIERRE.


<p/>Those who live in retirement, whose lives have fallen amid the
seclusion of schools or of other walled-in and guarded dwellings, are
liable to be suddenly and for a long while dropped out of the memory of
their friends, the denizens of a freer world. Unaccountably, perhaps,
and close upon some space of unusually frequent intercourse--some
congeries of rather exciting little circumstances, whose natural sequel
would rather seem to be the quickening than the suspension of
communication--there falls a stilly pause, a wordless silence, a long
blank of oblivion. Unbroken always is this blank; alike entire and
unexplained. The letter, the message once frequent, are cut off; the
visit, formerly periodical, ceases to occur; the book, paper, or other
token that indicated remembrance, comes no more.

<p/>Always there are excellent reasons for these lapses, if the hermit but
knew them. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is stagnant in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) cell, his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) connections without
are whirling in the very vortex of life. That void interval which
passes for him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) so slowly that the very clocks seem at a stand, and the
wingless hours plod by in the likeness of tired tramps prone to rest at
milestones--that same interval, perhaps, teems with events, and pants
with hurry for his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) friends.

<p/>The hermit--if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) be a sensible hermit--will swallow his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own thoughts,
and lock up his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own emotions during these weeks of inward winter. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
will know that Destiny designed him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to imitate, on occasion, the
dormouse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) will be conformable: make a tidy ball of himself,
creep into a hole of life's wall, and submit decently to the drift
which blows in and soon blocks him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) up, preserving him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) in ice for the
season.

<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``It is quite right: it ought to be so, since so it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And, perhaps, one day his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) snow-sepulchre will open, spring's softness
will return, the sun and south-wind will reach him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); the budding of
hedges, and carolling of birds, and singing of liberated streams, will
call him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to kindly resurrection. _Perhaps_ this may be the case,
perhaps not: the frost may get into his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) heart and never thaw more; when
spring comes, a crow or a pie may pick out of the wall only his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
dormouse-bones. Well, even in that case, all will be right: it is to be
supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) knew from the first he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was mortal, and must one day go the
way of all flesh, <div class="bookquote">``As well soon as syne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Following that eventful evening at the theatre, came for me seven weeks
as bare as seven sheets of blank paper: no word was written on one of
them; not a visit, not a token.

<p/>About the middle of that time I entertained fancies that something had
happened to my friends at La Terrasse. The mid-blank is always a
beclouded point for the solitary: his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) nerves ache with the strain of
long expectancy; the doubts hitherto repelled gather now to a mass
and--strong in accumulation--roll back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) with a force which
savours of vindictiveness. Night, too, becomes an unkindly time, and
sleep and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) nature cannot agree: strange starts and struggles harass
his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) couch: the sinister band of bad dreams, with horror of calamity,
and sick dread of entire desertion at their head, join the league
against him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). Poor wretch! He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) does his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) best to bear up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is a
poor, pallid, wasting wretch, despite that best.

<p/>Towards the last of these long seven weeks I admitted, what through the
other six I had jealously excluded--the conviction that these blanks
were inevitable: the result of circumstances, the fiat of fate, a part
of my life's lot and--above all--a matter about whose origin no
question must ever be asked, for whose painful sequence no murmur ever
uttered. Of course I did not blame myself for suffering: I thank God I
had a truer sense of justice than to fall into any imbecile
extravagance of self-accusation; and as to blaming others for silence,
in my reason I well knew them blameless, and in my heart acknowledged
them so: but it was a rough and heavy road to travel, and I longed for
better days.

<p/>I tried different expedients to sustain and fill existence: I commenced
an elaborate piece of lace-work, I studied German pretty hard, I
undertook a course of regular reading of the driest and thickest books
in the library; in all my efforts I was as orthodox as I knew how to
be. Was there error somewhere? Very likely. I only know the result was
as if I had gnawed a file to satisfy hunger, or drank brine to quench
thirst.

<p/>My hour of torment was the post-hour. Unfortunately, I knew it too
well, and tried as vainly as assiduously to cheat myself of that
knowledge; dreading the rack of expectation, and the sick collapse of
disappointment which daily preceded and followed upon that
well-recognised ring.

<p/>I suppose animals kept in cages, and so scantily fed as to be always
upon the verge of famine, await their food as I awaited a letter.
Oh!--to speak truth, and drop that tone of a false calm which long to
sustain, outwears nature's endurance--I underwent in those seven weeks
bitter fears and pains, strange inward trials, miserable defections of
hope, intolerable encroachments of despair. This last came so near me
sometimes that her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) breath went right through me. I used to feel it like
a baleful air or sigh, penetrate deep, and make motion pause at my
heart, or proceed only under unspeakable oppression. The letter--the
well-beloved letter--would not come; and it was all of sweetness in
life I had to look for.

<p/>In the very extremity of want, I had recourse again, and yet again, to
the little packet in the case--the five letters. How splendid that
month seemed whose skies had beheld the rising of these five stars! It
was always at night I visited them, and not daring to ask every evening
for a candle in the kitchen, I bought a wax taper and matches to light
it, and at the study-hour stole up to the dormitory and feasted on my
crust from the Barmecide's loaf. It did not nourish me: I pined on it,
and got as thin as a shadow: otherwise I was not ill.

<p/>Reading there somewhat late one evening, and feeling that the power to
read was leaving me--for the letters from incessant perusal were losing
all sap and significance: my gold was withering to leaves before my
eyes, and I was sorrowing over the disillusion--suddenly a quick
tripping foot ran up the stairs. I knew Ginevra Fanshawe's step: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
had dined in town that afternoon; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was now returned, and would come
here to replace her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) shawl, &c. in the wardrobe.

<p/>Yes: in she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) came, dressed in bright silk, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) shawl falling from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) shoulders, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) curls, half-uncurled in the damp of night,
drooping careless and heavy upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) neck. I had hardly time to
recasket my treasures and lock them up when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was at my side her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
humour seemed none of the best.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been a stupid evening: they are stupid people,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) began.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) yawned. Throwing herself without ceremony on my bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``It

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! indeed. And they live at a large hotel in the Rue Crécy?''

occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) accident--Accident? Bah! All affectation! I don't think
she (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) was squeezed more than she (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) richly deserves for her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) airs. And now
there is quite an intimacy struck up: I heard something about `auld

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_All!_ You said you were the only visitor.''

conceited doll it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ginevra/Miss Fanshawe/Ginevra Fanshawe</b></font>)</div><p/>Soured and listless, Miss Fanshawe was beginning to disclose the causes
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) prostrate condition. There had been a retrenchment of incense, a
diversion or a total withholding of homage and attention coquetry had
failed of effect, vanity had undergone mortification. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) lay fuming in
the vapours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Miss de Bassompierre quite well now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As well as you or I, no doubt; but she (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) is an affected little thing,
and gave herself invalid airs to attract medical notice. And to see the

prohibiting excitement, etcetera--faugh! the scene was quite sickening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not have been so if the object of attention had been changed:

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! I hate `my son John!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`My son John!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--whom do you indicate by that name? Dr. Bretton's
mother never calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) so.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) ought. A clownish, bearish John he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You violate the truth in saying so; and as the whole of my patience is

what always makes you so mighty testy à l'endroit du gros Jean? ``John
Anderson, my Joe, John!<div class="bookquote">'' Oh, the distinguished name!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>Thrilling with exasperation, to which it would have been sheer folly to
have given vent--for there was no contending with that unsubstantial
feather, that mealy-winged moth--I extinguished my taper, locked my
bureau, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), since she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not leave me. Small-beer as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had turned insufferably acid.

<p/>The morrow was Thursday and a half-holiday. Breakfast was over; I had
withdrawn to the first classe. The dreaded hour, the post-hour, was
nearing, and I sat waiting it, much as a ghost-seer might wait his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
spectre. Less than ever was a letter probable; still, strive as I
would, I could not forget that it was possible. As the moments
lessened, a restlessness and fear almost beyond the average assailed
me. It was a day of winter east wind, and I had now for some time
entered into that dreary fellowship with the winds and their changes,
so little known, so incomprehensible to the healthy. The north and east
owned a terrific influence, making all pain more poignant, all sorrow
sadder. The south could calm, the west sometimes cheer: unless, indeed,
they brought on their wings the burden of thunder-clouds, under the
weight and warmth of which all energy died.

<p/>Bitter and dark as was this January day, I remember leaving the classe,
and running down without bonnet to the bottom of the long garden, and
then lingering amongst the stripped shrubs, in the forlorn hope that
the postman's ring might occur while I was out of hearing, and I might
thus be spared the thrill which some particular nerve or nerves, almost
gnawed through with the unremitting tooth of a fixed idea, were
becoming wholly unfit to support. I lingered as long as I dared without
fear of attracting attention by my absence. I muffled my head in my
apron, and stopped my ears in terror of the torturing clang, sure to be
followed by such blank silence, such barren vacuum for me. At last I
ventured to re-enter the first classe, where, as it was not yet nine
o'clock, no pupils had been admitted. The first thing seen was a white
object on my black desk, a white, flat object. The post had, indeed,
arrived; by me unheard. Rosine had visited my cell, and, like some
angel, had left behind her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) a bright token of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) presence. That shining
thing on the desk was indeed a letter, a real letter; I saw so much at
the distance of three yards, and as I had but one correspondent on
earth, from that one it must come. He (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) remembered me yet. How deep a
pulse of gratitude sent new life through my heart.

<p/>Drawing near, bending and looking on the letter, in trembling but
almost certain hope of seeing a known hand, it was my lot to find, on
the contrary, an autograph for the moment deemed unknown--a pale female
scrawl, instead of a firm, masculine character. I then thought fate was
_too_ hard for me, and I said, audibly, <div class="bookquote">``This is cruel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I got over that pain also. Life is still life, whatever its pangs:
our eyes and ears and their use remain with us, though the prospect of
what pleases be wholly withdrawn, and the sound of what consoles be
quite silenced.

<p/>I opened the billet: by this time I had recognised its handwriting as
perfectly familiar. It was dated <div class="bookquote">``La Terrasse,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and it ran thus:--

<p/>``DEAR LUCY,--It occurs to me to inquire what you have been doing with
yourself for the last month or two? Not that I suspect you would have
the least difficulty in giving an account of your proceedings. I
daresay you have been just as busy and as happy as ourselves at La
Terrasse. As to Graham, his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) professional connection extends daily: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
is so much sought after, so much engaged, that I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) will grow
quite conceited. Like a right good mother, as I am, I do my best to
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) down: no flattery does he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) get from me, as you know. And yet,
Lucy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is a fine fellow: his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mother's heart dances at the sight of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). After being hurried here and there the whole day, and passing the
ordeal of fifty sorts of tempers, and combating a hundred caprices, and
sometimes witnessing cruel sufferings--perhaps, occasionally, as I tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), inflicting them--at night he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) still comes home to me in such
kindly, pleasant mood, that really, I seem to live in a sort of moral
antipodes, and on these January evenings my day rises when other
people's night sets in.

<p/>``Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) needs keeping in order, and correcting, and repressing, and I
do him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) that good service; but the boy is so elastic there is no such
thing as vexing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thoroughly. When I think I have at last driven him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
to the sullens, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turns on me with jokes for retaliation: but you know
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) iniquities, and I am but an elderly simpleton to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the subject of this epistle.

<p/>``As for me, I have had my old Bretton agent here on a visit, and have
been plunged overhead and ears in business matters. I do so wish to
regain for Graham at least some part of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) father left him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
laughs to scorn my anxiety on this point, bidding me look and see how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) can provide for himself and me too, and asking what the old lady can
possibly want that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has not; hinting about sky-blue turbans;
accusing me of an ambition to wear diamonds, keep livery servants, have
an hotel, and lead the fashion amongst the English clan in Villette.

<p/>``Talking of sky-blue turbans, I wish you had been with us the other
evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had come in really tired, and after I had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) threw himself into my chair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) customary presumption. To
my great delight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) dropped asleep. -LRB-You know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) teases me about
being drowsy; I, who never, by any chance, close an eye by daylight.-RRB-
While he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) slept, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) looked very bonny, Lucy: fool as I am to
be so proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); but who can help it? Show me his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) peer. Look where I
will, I see nothing like him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) in Villette. Well, I took it into my head
to play him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) a trick: so I brought out the sky-blue turban, and handling
it with gingerly precaution, I managed to invest his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) brows with this
grand adornment. I assure you it did not at all misbecome him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
looked quite Eastern, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is so fair. Nobody, however, can
accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) of having red hair _now_--it is genuine chestnut--a dark,
glossy chestnut; and when I put my large cashmere about him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), there was
as fine a young bey, dey, or pacha improvised as you would wish to see.

<p/>``It was good entertainment; but only half-enjoyed, since I was alone:
you should have been there.

<p/>``In due time my lord awoke: the looking-glass above the fireplace soon
intimated to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) plight: as you may imagine, I now live under
threat and dread of vengeance.

<p/>``But to come to the gist of my letter. I know Thursday is a
half-holiday in the Rue Fossette: be ready, then, by five in the
afternoon, at which hour I will send the carriage to take you out to La
Terrasse. Be sure to come: you may meet some old acquaintance. Good-by,
my wise, dear, grave little god-daughter.--Very truly yours,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``LOUISA BRETTON.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>Now, a letter like that sets one to rights! I might still be sad after
reading that letter, but I was more composed; not exactly cheered,
perhaps, but relieved. My friends, at least, were well and happy: no
accident had occurred to Graham; no illness had seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
mother--calamities that had so long been my dream and thought. Their
feelings for me too were--as they had been. Yet, how strange it was to
look on Mrs. Bretton's seven weeks and contrast them with my seven
weeks! Also, how very wise it is in people placed in an exceptional
position to hold their tongues and not rashly declare how such position
galls them! The world can understand well enough the process of
perishing for want of food: perhaps few persons can enter into or
follow out that of going mad from solitary confinement. They see the
long-buried prisoner disinterred, a maniac or an idiot!--how his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) senses
left him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>)--how his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) nerves, first inflamed, underwent nameless agony, and
then sunk to palsy--is a subject too intricate for examination, too
abstract for popular comprehension. Speak of it! you might almost as
well stand up in an European market-place, and propound dark sayings in
that language and mood wherein Nebuchadnezzar, the imperial
hypochondriac, communed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) baffled Chaldeans. And long, long may
the minds to whom such themes are no mystery--by whom their bearings
are sympathetically seized--be few in number, and rare of rencounter.
Long may it be generally thought that physical privations alone merit
compassion, and that the rest is a figment. When the world was younger
and haler than now, moral trials were a deeper mystery still: perhaps
in all the land of Israel there was but one Saul--certainly but one
David to soothe or comprehend him (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>).

<p/>The keen, still cold of the morning was succeeded, later in the day, by
a sharp breathing from Russian wastes: the cold zone sighed over the
temperate zone, and froze it fast. A heavy firmament, dull, and thick
with snow, sailed up from the north, and settled over expectant Europe.
Towards afternoon began the descent. I feared no carriage would come,
the white tempest raged so dense and wild. But trust my godmother! Once
having asked, she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) guest. About six o'clock I was lifted
from the carriage over the already blocked-up front steps of the
château, and put in at the door of La Terrasse.

<p/>Running through the vestibule, and up-stairs to the drawing-room, there
I found Mrs. Bretton--a summer-day in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own person. Had I been twice
as cold as I was, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) kind kiss and cordial clasp would have warmed me.
Inured now for so long a time to rooms with bare boards, black benches,
desks, and stoves, the blue saloon seemed to me gorgeous. In its
Christmas-like fire alone there was a clear and crimson splendour which
quite dazzled me.

<p/>When my godmother had held my hand for a little while, and chatted with
me, and scolded me for having become thinner than when she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) last saw me,
she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) professed to discover that the snow-wind had disordered my hair,
and sent me up-stairs to make it neat and remove my shawl.

<p/>Repairing to my own little sea-green room, there also I found a bright
fire, and candles too were lit: a tall waxlight stood on each side the
great looking glass; but between the candles, and before the glass,
appeared something dressing itself--an airy, fairy thing--small,
slight, white--a winter spirit.

<p/>I declare, for one moment I thought of Graham and his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) spectral
illusions. With distrustful eye I noted the details of this new vision.
It wore white, sprinkled slightly with drops of scarlet; its girdle was
red; it had something in its hair leafy, yet shining--a little wreath
with an evergreen gloss. Spectral or not, here truly was nothing
frightful, and I advanced.

<p/>Turning quick upon me, a large eye, under long lashes, flashed over me,
the intruder: the lashes were as dark as long, and they softened with
their pencilling the orb they guarded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are come!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breathed out, in a soft, quiet voice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
smiled slowly, and gazed intently.

<p/>I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now. Having only once seen that sort of face, with that cast
of fine and delicate featuring, I could not but know her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss de Bassompierre,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pronounced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply, <div class="bookquote">``not Miss de Bassompierre for _you!_''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not
inquire who then she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might be, but waited voluntary information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are changed, but still you are yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, approaching
nearer. <div class="bookquote">``I remember you well--your countenance, the colour of your
hair, the outline of your face...''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had moved to the fire, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stood opposite, and gazed into me; and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gazed, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face became gradually more and more expressive of
thought and feeling, till at last a dimness quenched her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) clear vision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me almost cry to look so far back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``but as to
being sorry, or sentimental, don't think it: on the contrary, I am
quite pleased and glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Interested, yet altogether at fault, I knew not what to say. At last I
stammered, <div class="bookquote">``I think I never met you till that night, some weeks ago,
when you were hurt...?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``You have forgotten then that I have sat on your knee, been
lifted in your arms, even shared your pillow? You no longer remember
the night when I came crying, like a naughty little child as I was, to
your bedside, and you took me in. You have no memory for the comfort
and protection by which you soothed an acute distress? Go back to
Bretton. Remember Mr. Home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>At last I saw it all. <div class="bookquote">``And you are little Polly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Paulina Mary Home de Bassompierre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>How time can change! Little Polly wore in her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) pale, small features, her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>)
fairy symmetry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) varying expression, a certain promise of interest
and grace; but Paulina Mary was become beautiful--not with the beauty
that strikes the eye like a rose--orbed, ruddy, and replete; not with
the plump, and pink, and flaxen attributes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) blond cousin Ginevra;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seventeen years had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a refined and tender charm
which did not lie in complexion, though hers was fair and clear; nor in
outline, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) features were sweet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) limbs perfectly
turned; but, I think, rather in a subdued glow from the soul outward.
This was not an opaque vase, of material however costly, but a lamp
chastely lucent, guarding from extinction, yet not hiding from worship,
a flame vital and vestal. In speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) attractions, I would not
exaggerate language; but, indeed, they seemed to me very real and
engaging. What though all was on a small scale, it was the perfume
which gave this white violet distinction, and made it superior to the
broadest camelia--the fullest dahlia that ever bloomed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! and you remember the old time at Bretton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``better, perhaps, than you. I remember it with
minute distinctness: not only the time, but the days of the time, and
the hours of the days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have forgotten some things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very little, I imagine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were then a little creature of quick feelings: you must, long ere
this, have outgrown the impressions with which joy and grief, affection
and bereavement, stamped your mind ten years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I have forgotten whom I liked, and in what degree I liked
them when a child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sharpness must be gone--the point, the poignancy--the deep imprint
must be softened away and effaced?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a good memory for those days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes were the eyes of one who can
remember; one whose childhood does not fade like a dream, nor whose
youth vanish like a sunbeam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not take life, loosely and
incoherently, in parts, and let one season slip as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) entered on
another: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would retain and add; often review from the commencement,
and so grow in harmony and consistency as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) grew in years. Still I
could not quite admit the conviction that _all_ the pictures which now
crowded upon me were vivid and visible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fond attachments,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sports and contests with a well-loved playmate, the patient, true
devotion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) child's heart, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fears, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) delicate reserves, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
little trials, the last piercing pain of separation... I retraced
these things, and shook my head incredulous. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) persisted. <div class="bookquote">``The child
of seven years lives yet in the girl of seventeen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You used to be excessively fond of Mrs. Bretton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked,
intending to test her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) set me right at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not _excessively_ fond,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>): I respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) as I
should do now: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) seems to me very little altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) is not much changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assented.

<p/>We were silent a few minutes. Glancing round the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``There
are several things here that used to be at Bretton! I remember that
pincushion and that looking-glass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not deceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) estimate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own memory; not,
at least, so far.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think, then, you would have known Mrs. Bretton?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I perfectly remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); the turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) features, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) olive
complexion, and black hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) height, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) walk, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) voice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Bretton, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pursued, <div class="bookquote">``would be out of the question:
and, indeed, as I saw your first interview with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), I am aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
appeared to you as a stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That first night I was puzzled,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did the recognition between him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) and your father come about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They exchanged cards. The names Graham Bretton and Home de
Bassompierre gave rise to questions and explanations. That was on the
second day; but before then I was beginning to know something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How--know something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``how strange it is that most people seem so slow to
feel the truth--not to see, but _feel_! When Dr. Bretton had visited me
a few times, and sat near and talked to me; when I had observed the
look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) eyes, the expression about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mouth, the form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) chin,
the carriage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) head, and all that we _do_ observe in persons who
approach us--how could I avoid being led by association to think of
Graham Bretton? Graham was slighter than he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), and not grown so tall, and
had a smoother face, and longer and lighter hair, and spoke--not so
deeply--more like a girl; but yet _he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)_ is Graham, just as _I_ am little
Polly, or you are Lucy Snowe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought the same, but I wondered to find my thoughts hers: there are
certain things in which we so rarely meet with our double that it seems
a miracle when that chance befalls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and Graham were once playmates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you remember that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) questioned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) will remember it also,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>): few things would surprise me so much as to find
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) did. I suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) disposition is still gay and careless?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it so formerly? Did it so strike you? Do you thus remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I scarcely remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) in any other light. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was studious;
sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was merry: but whether busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) books or disposed for
play, it was chiefly the books or game he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) thought of; not much heeding
those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) read or amused himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet to you he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was partial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partial to me? Oh, no! he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had other playmates--his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) school-fellows; I
was of little consequence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), except on Sundays: yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was kind
on Sundays. I remember walking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) hand-in-hand to St. Mary's, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) finding the places in my prayer-book; and how good and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was
on Sunday evenings! So mild for such a proud, lively boy; so patient
with all my blunders in reading; and so wonderfully to be depended on,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) never spent those evenings from home: I had a constant fear that
he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) would accept some invitation and forsake us; but he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) never did, nor
seemed ever to wish to do it. Thus, of course, it can be no more. I
suppose Sunday will now be Dr. Bretton's dining-out day...?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Children, come down!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>here called Mrs. Bretton from below. Paulina
would still have lingered, but I inclined to descend: we went down.




<p/>CHAPTER XXV.

<p/>THE LITTLE COUNTESS.


<p/>Cheerful as my godmother naturally was, and entertaining as, for our
sakes, she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) made a point of being, there was no true enjoyment that
evening at La Terrasse, till, through the wild howl of the
winter-night, were heard the signal sounds of arrival. How often, while
women and girls sit warm at snug fire-sides, their hearts and
imaginations are doomed to divorce from the comfort surrounding their
persons, forced out by night to wander through dark ways, to dare
stress of weather, to contend with the snow-blast, to wait at lonely
gates and stiles in wildest storms, watching and listening to see and
hear the father, the son, the husband coming home.

<p/>Father and son came at last to the château: for the Count de
Bassompierre that night accompanied Dr. Bretton. I know not which of
our trio heard the horses first; the asperity, the violence of the
weather warranted our running down into the hall to meet and greet the
two riders as they came in; but they warned us to keep our distance:
both were white--two mountains of snow; and indeed Mrs. Bretton, seeing
their condition, ordered them instantly to the kitchen; prohibiting
them, at their peril, from setting foot on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) carpeted staircase till
they had severally put off that mask of Old Christmas they now
affected. Into the kitchen, however, we could not help following them:
it was a large old Dutch kitchen, picturesque and pleasant. The little
white Countess danced in a circle about her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) equally white sire,
clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) hands and crying, <div class="bookquote">``Papa, papa, you look like an enormous
Polar bear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sire</b></font>)</div><p/>The bear shook himself, and the little sprite fled far from the frozen
shower. Back she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) came, however, laughing, and eager to aid in removing
the arctic disguise. The Count, at last issuing from his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) dreadnought,
threatened to overwhelm her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) with it as with an avalanche.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), bending to invite the fall, and when it was
playfully advanced above her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) head, bounding out of reach like some
little chamois.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) movements had the supple softness, the velvet grace of a kitten;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) laugh was clearer than the ring of silver and crystal; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) sire's cold hands and rubbed them, and stood on tiptoe to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>)
lips for a kiss, there seemed to shine round her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) a halo of loving
delight. The grave and reverend seignor looked down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) as men _do_
look on what is the apple of their eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bretton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``what am I to do with this daughter or
daughterling of mine? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) neither grows in wisdom nor in stature. Don't
you find her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) pretty nearly as much the child as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was ten years ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) cannot be more the child than this great boy of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Bretton, who was in conflict with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) son about some change of dress
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) deemed advisable, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) resisted. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) stood leaning against
the Dutch dresser, laughing and keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) at arm's length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``by way of compromise, and to secure for us
inward as well as outward warmth, let us have a Christmas wassail-cup,
and toast Old England here, on the hearth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So, while the Count stood by the fire, and Paulina Mary still danced to
and fro--happy in the liberty of the wide hall-like kitchen--Mrs.
Bretton herself instructed Martha to spice and heat the wassail-bowl,
and, pouring the draught into a Bretton flagon, it was served round,
reaming hot, by means of a small silver vessel, which I recognised as
Graham's christening-cup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's to Auld Lang Syne!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Count; holding the glancing cup on
high. Then, looking at Mrs. Bretton.--

<p/>``We twa ha' paidlet i' the burn
Fra morning sun till dine,
But seas between us braid ha' roared
Sin' auld lane syne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And surely ye'll be your pint-stoup,
And surely I'll be mine;
And we'll taste a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scotch! Scotch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div>cried Paulina; <div class="bookquote">``papa is talking Scotch; and Scotch he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
is, partly. We are Home and de Bassompierre, Caledonian and Gallic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that a Scotch reel you are dancing, you Highland fairy?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bretton, there will be a green ring growing up in the
middle of your kitchen shortly. I would not answer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) being quite
cannie: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) is a strange little mortal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell Lucy to dance with me, papa; there is Lucy Snowe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Home -LRB-there was still quite as much about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) of plain Mr. Home as
of proud Count de Bassompierre-RRB- held his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) hand out to me, saying kindly,
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) remembered me well; and, even had his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) own memory been less
trustworthy, my name was so often on his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) daughter's lips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had
listened to so many long tales about me, I should seem like an old
acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Every one now had tasted the wassail-cup except Paulina, whose pas de
fée, ou de fantaisie, nobody thought of interrupting to offer so
profanatory a draught; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) was not to be overlooked, nor baulked of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) mortal privileges.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) to Graham, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was putting the cup on the
shelf of the dresser out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) reach.

<p/>Mrs. Bretton and Mr. Home were now engaged in conversation. Dr. John
had not been unobservant of the fairy's dance; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had watched it, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had liked it. To say nothing of the softness and beauty of the
movements, eminently grateful to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) grace-loving eye, that ease in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
mother's house charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), for it set _him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_ at ease: again she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed
a child for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--again, almost his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) playmate. I wondered how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); I had not yet seen him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) address her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) first words
proved that the old days of <div class="bookquote">``little Polly''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>had been recalled to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
mind by this evening's child-like light-heartedness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship wishes for the tankard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I said so. I think I intimated as much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't consent to a step of the kind on any account. Sorry for it,
but couldn't do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? I am quite well now: it can't break my collar-bone again, or
dislocate my shoulder. Is it wine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; nor dew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want dew; I don't like dew: but what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ale--strong ale--old October; brewed, perhaps, when I was born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be curious: is it good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excessively good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took it down, administered to himself a second dose of this
mighty elixir, expressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mischievous eyes extreme contentment
with the same, and solemnly replaced the cup on the shelf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div>said Paulina, looking up; <div class="bookquote">``I never had any
`old October:' is it sweet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perilously sweet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Graham.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) continued to look up exactly with the countenance of a child that
longs for some prohibited dainty. At last the Doctor relented, took it
down, and indulged himself in the gratification of letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) taste
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand; his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes, always expressive in the revelation of
pleasurable feelings, luminously and smilingly avowed that it _was_ a
gratification; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) prolonged it by so regulating the position of the
cup that only a drop at a time could reach the rosy, sipping lips by
which its brim was courted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A little more--a little more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), petulantly touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand
with the forefinger, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) incline the cup more generously and
yieldingly. <div class="bookquote">``It smells of spice and sugar, but I can't taste it; your
wrist is so stiff, and you are so stingy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) indulged her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), whispering, however, with gravity: <div class="bookquote">``Don't tell my
mother or Lucy; they wouldn't approve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), passing into another tone and manner as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had fairly assayed the beverage, just as if it had acted upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
like some disenchanting draught, undoing the work of a wizard: <div class="bookquote">``I find
it anything but sweet; it is bitter and hot, and takes away my breath.
Your old October was only desirable while forbidden. Thank you, no
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a wizard</b></font>)</div><p/>And, with a slight bend--careless, but as graceful as her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) dance--she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
glided from him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) and rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) father.

<p/>I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had spoken truth: the child of seven was in the girl of
seventeen.

<p/>Graham looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) a little baffled, a little puzzled; his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eye was
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) a good deal during the rest of the evening, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) did not seem
to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>).

<p/>As we ascended to the drawing-room for tea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) father's arm:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) natural place seemed to be at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side; her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) ears were
dedicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Mrs. Bretton were the chief talkers of our
little party, and Paulina was their best listener, attending closely to
all that was said, prompting the repetition of this or that trait or
adventure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where were you at such a time, papa? And what did you say then?
And tell Mrs. Bretton what happened on that occasion.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) drew
him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) out.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) did not again yield to any effervescence of glee; the infantine
sparkle was exhaled for the night: she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) was soft, thoughtful, and
docile. It was pretty to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) bid good-night; her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) manner to Graham
was touched with dignity: in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) very slight smile and quiet bow spoke
the Countess, and Graham could not but look grave, and bend responsive.
I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) hardly knew how to blend together in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) ideas the dancing
fairy and delicate dame.

<p/>Next day, when we were all assembled round the breakfast-table,
shivering and fresh from the morning's chill ablutions, Mrs. Bretton
pronounced a decree that nobody, who was not forced by dire necessity,
should quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) house that day.

<p/>Indeed, egress seemed next to impossible; the drift darkened the lower
panes of the casement, and, on looking out, one saw the sky and air
vexed and dim, the wind and snow in angry conflict. There was no fall
now, but what had already descended was torn up from the earth, whirled
round by brief shrieking gusts, and cast into a hundred fantastic forms.

<p/>The Countess seconded Mrs. Bretton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa shall not go out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), placing a seat for herself beside
her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) father's arm-chair. <div class="bookquote">``I will look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>). You won't go into town,
will you, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer. <div class="bookquote">``If you and Mrs. Bretton are _very_ good
to me, Polly--kind, you know, and attentive; if you pet me in a very
nice manner, and make much of me, I may possibly be induced to wait an
hour after breakfast and see whether this razor-edged wind settles.
But, you see, you give me no breakfast; you offer me nothing: you let
me starve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick! please, Mrs. Bretton, and pour out the coffee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div>entreated
Paulina, <div class="bookquote">``whilst I take care of the Count de Bassompierre in other
respects: since he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) grew into a Count, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has needed _so_ much
attention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) separated and prepared a roll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, papa, are your `pistolets' charged,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And there is
some marmalade, just the same sort of marmalade we used to have at
Bretton, and which you said was as good as if it had been conserved in
Scotland--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And which your little ladyship used to beg for my boy--do you remember
that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Bretton. ``Have you forgotten how you would come
to my elbow and touch my sleeve with the whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Please, ma'am,
something good for Graham--a little marmalade, or honey, or jam?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div>broke in Dr. John, laughing, yet reddening; <div class="bookquote">``it surely was
not so: I could not have cared for these things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. John/John/Dr. John Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) or did he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) not, Paulina?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) liked them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div>asserted Paulina.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never blush for it, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Home</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Home, encouragingly. <div class="bookquote">``I like them
myself yet, and always did. And Polly showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) sense in catering for
a friend's material comforts: it was I who put her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) into the way of such
good manners--nor do I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) forget them. Polly, offer me a small
slice of that tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, papa: but remember you are only waited upon with this
assiduity; on condition of being persuadable, and reconciling yourself
to La Terrasse for the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bretton,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Count, <div class="bookquote">``I want to get rid of my daughter--to
send her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) to school. Do you know of any good school?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is Lucy's place--Madame Beck's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe is in a school?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a teacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, and was rather glad of the opportunity of
saying this. For a little while I had been feeling as if placed in a
false position. Mrs. Bretton and son knew my circumstances; but the
Count and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) daughter did not. They might choose to vary by some
shades their hitherto cordial manner towards me, when aware of my grade
in society. I spoke then readily: but a swarm of thoughts I had not
anticipated nor invoked, rose dim at the words, making me sigh
involuntarily. Mr. Home did not lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) breakfast-plate
for about two minutes, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) speak; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) had not caught the
words--perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) thought that on a confession of that nature,
politeness would interdict comment: the Scotch are proverbially proud;
and homely as was Mr. Home in look, simple in habits and tastes, I have
all along intimated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) was not without his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) share of the national
quality. Was his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) a pseudo pride? was it real dignity? I leave the
question undecided in its wide sense. Where it concerned me
individually I can only answer: then, and always, he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) showed himself a
true-hearted gentleman.

<p/>By nature he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) was a feeler and a thinker; over his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) emotions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>)
reflections spread a mellowing of melancholy; more than a mellowing: in
trouble and bereavement it became a cloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) did not know much about
Lucy Snowe; what he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) did not very accurately comprehend: indeed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) misconceptions of my character often made me smile; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) saw my
walk in life lay rather on the shady side of the hill: he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) gave me
credit for doing my endeavour to keep the course honestly straight; he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>)
would have helped me if he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) could: having no opportunity of helping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>)
still wished me well. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) did look at me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) eye was kind; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>)
did speak, his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) voice was benevolent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is an arduous calling. I wish you health and
strength to win in it--success.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) fair little daughter did not take the information quite so
composedly: she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fixed on me a pair of eyes wide with wonder--almost
with dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you a teacher?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Then, having paused on the unpalatable
idea, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I never knew what you were, nor ever thought of asking:
for me, you were always Lucy Snowe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what am I now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not forbear inquiring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yourself, of course. But do you really teach here, in Villette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why do you go on with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father looked at, and, I feared, was going to check her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
only said, <div class="bookquote">``Proceed, Polly, proceed with that catechism--prove yourself
the little wiseacre you are. If Miss Snowe were to blush and look
confused, I should have to bid you hold your tongue; and you and I
would sit out the present meal in some disgrace; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) only smiles,
so push her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) hard, multiply the cross-questions. Well, Miss Snowe, why
do you go on with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chiefly, I fear, for the sake of the money I get.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not then from motives of pure philanthropy? Polly and I were clinging
to that hypothesis as the most lenient way of accounting for your
eccentricity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--no, sir. Rather for the roof of shelter I am thus enabled to keep
over my head; and for the comfort of mind it gives me to think that
while I can work for myself, I am spared the pain of being a burden to
anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, say what you will, I pity Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take up that pity, Miss de Bassompierre; take it up in both hands, as
you might a little callow gosling squattering out of bounds without
leave; put it back in the warm nest of a heart whence it issued, and
receive in your ear this whisper. If my Polly ever came to know by
experience the uncertain nature of this world's goods, I should like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) to act as Lucy acts: to work for herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might burden
neither kith nor kin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), pensively and tractably. <div class="bookquote">``But poor Lucy! I
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was a rich lady, and had rich friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought like a little simpleton. _I_ never thought so. When I had
time to consider Lucy's manner and aspect, which was not often, I saw
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was one who had to guard and not be guarded; to act and not be
served: and this lot has, I imagine, helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to an experience for
which, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) live long enough to realize its full benefit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) may yet
bless Providence. But this school,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pursued, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tone from
grave to gay: <div class="bookquote">``would Madame Beck admit my Polly, do you think, Miss
Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I said, there needed but to try Madame; it would soon be seen: she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was
fond of English pupils. <div class="bookquote">``If you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added, <div class="bookquote">``will but take Miss de
Bassompierre in your carriage this very afternoon, I think I can answer
for it that Rosine, the portress, will not be very slow in answering
your ring; and Madame, I am sure, will put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) best pair of gloves
to come into the salon to receive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Home</b></font>)</div>responded Mr. Home, <div class="bookquote">``I see no sort of necessity there
is for delay. Mrs. Hurst can send what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) young lady's
`things' after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>); Polly can settle down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) horn-book before
night; and you, Miss Lucy, I trust, will not disdain to cast an
occasional eye upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and let me know, from time to time, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
gets on. I hope you approve of the arrangement, Countess de
Bassompierre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Home</b></font>)</div><p/>The Countess hemmed and hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I thought I
had finished my education--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That only proves how much we may be mistaken in our thoughts. I hold a
far different opinion, as most of these will who have been auditors of
your profound knowledge of life this morning. Ah, my little girl, thou
hast much to learn; and papa ought to have taught thee more than he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has
done! Come, there is nothing for it but to try Madame Beck; and the
weather seems settling, and I have finished my breakfast--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see an obstacle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is enormous, papa; it can never be got over; it is as large as you
in your greatcoat, and the snowdrift on the top.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, like that snowdrift, capable of melting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! it is of too--too solid flesh: it is just your own self. Miss
Lucy, warn Madame Beck not to listen to any overtures about taking me,
because, in the end, it would turn out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have to take papa
too: as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is so teasing, I will just tell tales about him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). Mrs.
Bretton and all of you listen: About five years ago, when I was twelve
years old, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) head that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was spoiling me; that I was
growing unfitted for the world, and I don't know what, and nothing
would serve or satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), but I must go to school. I cried, and so
on; but M. de Bassompierre proved hard-hearted, quite firm and flinty,
and to school I went. What was the result? In the most admirable
manner, papa came to school likewise: every other day he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) called to see
me. Madame Aigredoux grumbled, but it was of no use; and so, at last,
papa and I were both, in a manner, expelled. Lucy can just tell Madame
Beck this little trait: it is only fair to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has to
expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bretton asked Mr. Home what he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) had to say in answer to this
statement. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) made no defence, judgment was given against him (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>), and
Paulina triumphed.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had other moods besides the arch and naïve. After breakfast;
when the two elders withdrew--I suppose to talk over certain of Mrs.
Bretton's business matters--and the Countess, Dr. Bretton, and I, were
for a short time alone together--all the child left her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>); with us, more
nearly her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) companions in age, she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) rose at once to the little lady: her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
very face seemed to alter; that play of feature, and candour of look,
which, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) father, made it quite dimpled and round,
yielded to an aspect more thoughtful, and lines distincter and less
_mobile_.

<p/>No doubt Graham noted the change as well as I. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) stood for some
minutes near the window, looking out at the snow; presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>),
approached the hearth, and entered into conversation, but not quite
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) usual ease: fit topics did not seem to rise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) lips; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
chose them fastidiously, hesitatingly, and consequently infelicitously:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) spoke vaguely of Villette--its inhabitants, its notable sights and
buildings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was answered by Miss de Bassompierre in quite womanly
sort; with intelligence, with a manner not indeed wholly
disindividualized: a tone, a glance, a gesture, here and there, rather
animated and quick than measured and stately, still recalled little
Polly; but yet there was so fine and even a polish, so calm and
courteous a grace, gilding and sustaining these peculiarities, that a
less sensitive man than Graham would not have ventured to seize upon
them as vantage points, leading to franker intimacy.

<p/>Yet while Dr. Bretton continued subdued, and, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), sedate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was
still observant. Not one of those petty impulses and natural breaks
escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) did not miss one characteristic movement, one
hesitation in language, or one lisp in utterance. At times, in speaking
fast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) still lisped; but coloured whenever such lapse occurred, and
in a painstaking, conscientious manner, quite as amusing as the slight
error, repeated the word more distinctly.

<p/>Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) did this, Dr. Bretton smiled. Gradually, as they
conversed, the restraint on each side slackened: might the conference
have but been prolonged, I believe it would soon have become genial:
already to Paulina's lip and cheek returned the wreathing, dimpling
smile; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lisped once, and forgot to correct herself. And Dr. John, I
know not how _he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_ changed, but change he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not grow gayer--no
raillery, no levity sparkled across his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) aspect--but his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) position seemed
to become one of more pleasure to himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) augmented
comfort in readier language, in tones more suave. Ten years ago this
pair had always found abundance to say to each other; the intervening
decade had not narrowed the experience or impoverished the intelligence
of either: besides, there are certain natures of which the mutual
influence is such, that the more they say, the more they have to say.
For these out of association grows adhesion, and out of adhesion,
amalgamation.

<p/>Graham, however, must go: his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was a profession whose claims are neither
to be ignored nor deferred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) left the room; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) could leave
the house there was a return. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) came back--not for the
paper, or card in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) desk, which formed his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) ostensible errand--but to
assure himself, by one more glance, that Paulina's aspect was really
such as memory was bearing away: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had not been viewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
somehow by a partial, artificial light, and making a fond mistake. No!
he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) found the impression true--rather, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) gained than lost by
this return: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) took away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) a parting look--shy, but very
soft--as beautiful, as innocent, as any little fawn could lift out of
its cover of fern, or any lamb from its meadow-bed.

<p/>Being left alone, Paulina and I kept silence for some time: we both
took out some work, and plied a mute and diligent task. The white-wood
workbox of old days was now replaced by one inlaid with precious
mosaic, and furnished with implements of gold; the tiny and trembling
fingers that could scarce guide the needle, though tiny still, were now
swift and skilful: but there was the same busy knitting of the brow,
the same little dainty mannerisms, the same quick turns and
movements--now to replace a stray tress, and anon to shake from the
silken skirt some imaginary atom of dust--some clinging fibre of thread.

<p/>That morning I was disposed for silence: the austere fury of the
winter-day had on me an awing, hushing influence. That passion of
January, so white and so bloodless, was not yet spent: the storm had
raved itself hoarse, but seemed no nearer exhaustion. Had Ginevra
Fanshawe been my companion in that drawing-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would not have
suffered me to muse and listen undisturbed. The presence just gone from
us would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) theme; and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would have rung the changes
on one topic! how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) would have pursued and pestered me with questions
and surmises--worried and oppressed me with comments and confidences I
did not want, and longed to avoid.

<p/>Paulina Mary cast once or twice towards me a quiet but penetrating
glance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dark, full eye; her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips half opened, as if to the
impulse of coming utterance: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw and delicately respected my
inclination for silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This will not hold long,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought to myself; for I was not
accustomed to find in women or girls any power of self-control, or
strength of self-denial. As far as I knew them, the chance of a gossip
about their usually trivial secrets, their often very washy and paltry
feelings, was a treat not to be readily foregone.

<p/>The little Countess promised an exception: she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) sewed till she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was tired
of sewing, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) took a book.

<p/>As chance would have it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had sought it in Dr. Bretton's own
compartment of the bookcase; and it proved to be an old Bretton
book--some illustrated work of natural history. Often had I seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
standing at Graham's side, resting that volume on his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) knee, and reading
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) tuition; and, when the lesson was over, begging, as a treat,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) all about the pictures. I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) keenly:
here was a true test of that memory she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had boasted; would her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
recollections now be faithful?

<p/>Faithful? It could not be doubted. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) turned the leaves, over her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
face passed gleam after gleam of expression, the least intelligent of
which was a full greeting to the Past. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) turned to the
title-page, and looked at the name written in the schoolboy hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
looked at it long; nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) satisfied with merely looking: she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
gently passed over the characters the tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) fingers, accompanying
the action with an unconscious but tender smile, which converted the
touch into a caress. Paulina loved the Past; but the peculiarity of
this little scene was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) _said_ nothing: she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) could feel without
pouring out her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) feelings in a flux of words.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) now occupied herself at the bookcase for nearly an hour; taking
down volume after volume, and renewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) acquaintance with each. This
done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) seated herself on a low stool, rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) cheek on her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) hand,
and thought, and still was mute.

<p/>The sound of the front door opened below, a rush of cold wind, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
father's voice speaking to Mrs. Bretton in the hall, startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) at
last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) sprang up: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was down-stairs in one second.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa! papa! you are not going out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My pet, I must go into town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is too--_too_ cold, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And then I heard M. de Bassompierre showing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) was well
provided against the weather; and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) was going to have the
carriage, and to be quite snugly sheltered; and, in short, proving that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) need not fear for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) comfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will promise to come back here this evening, before it is
quite dark;--you and Dr. Bretton, both, in the carriage? It is not fit
to ride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if I see the Doctor, I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) a lady has laid on him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
commands to take care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) precious health and come home early under
my escort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you must say a lady; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) will think it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mother, and be
obedient. And, papa, mind to come soon, for I _shall_ watch and listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The door closed, and the carriage rolled softly through the snow; and
back returned the Countess, pensive and anxious.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) _did_ listen, and watch, when evening closed; but it was in
stillest sort: walking the drawing-room with quite noiseless step. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
checked at intervals her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) velvet march; inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) ear, and consulted
the night sounds: I should rather say, the night silence; for now, at
last, the wind was fallen. The sky, relieved of its avalanche, lay
naked and pale: through the barren boughs of the avenue we could see it
well, and note also the polar splendour of the new-year moon--an orb
white as a world of ice. Nor was it late when we saw also the return of
the carriage.

<p/>Paulina had no dance of welcome for this evening. It was with a sort of
gravity that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) took immediate possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) father, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entered
the room; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) at once made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) entire property, led him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to the
seat of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) choice, and, while softly showering round him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) honeyed words
of commendation for being so good and coming home so soon, you would
have thought it was entirely by the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) little hands he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
put into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair, and settled and arranged; for the strong man seemed
to take pleasure in wholly yielding himself to this dominion-potent
only by love.

<p/>Graham did not appear till some minutes after the Count. Paulina half
turned when his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) step was heard: they spoke, but only a word or two;
their fingers met a moment, but obviously with slight contact. Paulina
remained beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) father; Graham threw himself into a seat on the
other side of the room.

<p/>It was well that Mrs. Bretton and Mr. Home had a great deal to say to
each other--almost an inexhaustible fund of discourse in old
recollections; otherwise, I think, our party would have been but a
still one that evening.

<p/>After tea, Paulina's quick needle and pretty golden thimble were busily
plied by the lamp-light, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) tongue rested, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) eyes seemed
reluctant to raise often their lids, so smooth and so full-fringed.
Graham, too, must have been tired with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) day's work: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) listened
dutifully to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) elders and betters, said very little himself, and
followed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eye the gilded glance of Paulina's thimble; as if it
had been some bright moth on the wing, or the golden head of some
darting little yellow serpent.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVI.

<p/>A BURIAL.


<p/>From this date my life did not want variety; I went out a good deal,
with the entire consent of Madame Beck, who perfectly approved the
grade of my acquaintance. That worthy directress had never from the
first treated me otherwise than with respect; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) found that I
was liable to frequent invitations from a château and a great hotel,
respect improved into distinction.

<p/>Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) was fulsome about it: Madame, in all things worldly, was
in nothing weak; there was measure and sense in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) hottest pursuit of
self-interest, calm and considerateness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) closest clutch of gain;
without, then, laying herself open to my contempt as a time-server and
a toadie, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) marked with tact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) was pleased people connected
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) establishment should frequent such associates as must
cultivate and elevate, rather than those who might deteriorate and
depress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) never praised either me or my friends; only once when she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
was sitting in the sun in the garden, a cup of coffee at her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) elbow and
the Gazette in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) hand, looking very comfortable, and I came up and
asked leave of absence for the evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) delivered herself in this
gracious sort:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oui, oui, ma bonne amie: je vous donne la permission de coeur et de
gré. Votre travail dans ma maison a toujours été admirable, rempli de
zèle et de discrétion: vous avez bien le droit de vous amuser. Sortez
donc tant que vous voudrez. Quant à votre choix de connaissances, j'en
suis contente; c'est sage, digne, laudable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lips and resumed the Gazette.

<p/>The reader will not too gravely regard the little circumstance that
about this time the triply-enclosed packet of five letters temporarily
disappeared from my bureau. Blank dismay was naturally my first
sensation on making the discovery; but in a moment I took heart of
grace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Patience!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>whispered I to myself. <div class="bookquote">``Let me say nothing, but wait
peaceably; they will come back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And they did come back: they had only been on a short visit to Madame's
chamber; having passed their examination, they came back duly and
truly: I found them all right the next day.

<p/>I wonder what she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) thought of my correspondence? What estimate did she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
form of Dr. John Bretton's epistolary powers? In what light did the
often very pithy thoughts, the generally sound, and sometimes original
opinions, set, without pretension, in an easily-flowing, spirited
style, appear to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)? How did she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) like that genial, half humorous vein,
which to me gave such delight? What did she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) think of the few kind words
scattered here and there--not thickly, as the diamonds were scattered in
the valley of Sindbad, but sparely, as those gems lie in unfabled beds?
Oh, Madame Beck! how seemed these things to you?

<p/>I think in Madame Beck's eyes the five letters found a certain favour.
One day after she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had _borrowed_ them of me -LRB-in speaking of so suave a
little woman, one ought to use suave terms-RRB-, I caught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) examining me
with a steady contemplative gaze, a little puzzled, but not at all
malevolent. It was during that brief space between lessons, when the
pupils turned out into the court for a quarter of an hour's recreation;
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and I remained in the first classe alone: when I met her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
thoughts forced themselves partially through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Il y a,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``quelquechose de bien remarquable dans le caractère
Anglais.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How, Madame?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave a little laugh, repeating the word <div class="bookquote">``how''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>in English.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Je ne saurais vous dire `how;' mais, enfin, les Anglais ont des idées
à eux, en amitié, en amour, en tout. Mais au moins il n'est pas besoin
de les surveiller,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, getting up and trotting away like the
compact little pony she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>murmured I to myself, <div class="bookquote">``you will graciously let alone my
letters for the future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Alas! something came rushing into my eyes, dimming utterly their
vision, blotting from sight the schoolroom, the garden, the bright
winter sun, as I remembered that never more would letters, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had read, come to me. I had seen the last of them. That goodly river on
whose banks I had sojourned, of whose waves a few reviving drops had
trickled to my lips, was bending to another course: it was leaving my
little hut and field forlorn and sand-dry, pouring its wealth of waters
far away. The change was right, just, natural; not a word could be
said: but I loved my Rhine, my Nile; I had almost worshipped my Ganges,
and I grieved that the grand tide should roll estranged, should vanish
like a false mirage. Though stoical, I was not quite a stoic; drops
streamed fast on my hands, on my desk: I wept one sultry shower, heavy
and brief.

<p/>But soon I said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``The Hope I am bemoaning suffered and made
me suffer much: it did not die till it was full time: following an
agony so lingering, death ought to be welcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Welcome I endeavoured to make it. Indeed, long pain had made patience a
habit. In the end I closed the eyes of my dead, covered its face, and
composed its limbs with great calm.

<p/>The letters, however, must be put away, out of sight: people who have
undergone bereavement always jealously gather together and lock away
mementos: it is not supportable to be stabbed to the heart each moment
by sharp revival of regret.

<p/>One vacant holiday afternoon -LRB-the Thursday-RRB- going to my treasure, with
intent to consider its final disposal, I perceived--and this time with
a strong impulse of displeasure--that it had been again tampered with:
the packet was there, indeed, but the ribbon which secured it had been
untied and retied; and by other symptoms I knew that my drawer had been
visited.

<p/>This was a little too much. Madame Beck herself was the soul of
discretion, besides having as strong a brain and sound a judgment as
ever furnished a human head; that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should know the contents of my
casket, was not pleasant, but might be borne. Little Jesuit
inquisitress as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could see things in a true light, and
understand them in an unperverted sense; but the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
ventured to communicate information, thus gained, to others; that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
had, perhaps, amused herself with a companion over documents, in my
eyes most sacred, shocked me cruelly. Yet, that such was the case I now
saw reason to fear; I even guessed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) confidant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kinsman, M. Paul
Emanuel, had spent yesterday evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was much in the
habit of consulting him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), and of discussing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) matters she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
broached to no one else. This very morning, in class, that gentleman
had favoured me with a glance which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seemed to have borrowed from
Vashti, the actress; I had not at the moment comprehended that blue,
yet lurid, flash out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) angry eye; but I read its meaning now.
_He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)_, I believed, was not apt to regard what concerned me from a fair
point of view, nor to judge me with tolerance and candour: I had always
found him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) severe and suspicious: the thought that these letters, mere
friendly letters as they were, had fallen once, and might fall again,
into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands, jarred my very soul.

<p/>What should I do to prevent this? In what corner of this strange house
was it possible to find security or secresy? Where could a key be a
safeguard, or a padlock a barrier?

<p/>In the grenier? No, I did not like the grenier. Besides, most of the
boxes and drawers there were mouldering, and did not lock. Rats, too,
gnawed their way through the decayed wood; and mice made nests amongst
the litter of their contents: my dear letters -LRB-most dear still, though
Ichabod was written on their covers-RRB- might be consumed by vermin;
certainly the writing would soon become obliterated by damp. No; the
grenier would not do--but where then?

<p/>While pondering this problem, I sat in the dormitory window-seat. It
was a fine frosty afternoon; the winter sun, already setting, gleamed
pale on the tops of the garden-shrubs in the <div class="bookquote">``allée défendue.''  (<font color='red'><b>the nun</b></font>)</div>One
great old pear-tree--the nun's pear-tree--stood up a tall dryad
skeleton, grey, gaunt, and stripped. A thought struck me--one of those
queer fantastic thoughts that will sometimes strike solitary people. I
put on my bonnet, cloak, and furs, and went out into the city.

<p/>Bending my steps to the old historical quarter of the town, whose hoax
and overshadowed precincts I always sought by instinct in melancholy
moods, I wandered on from street to street, till, having crossed a half
deserted <div class="bookquote">``place''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>or square, I found myself before a sort of broker's
shop; an ancient place, full of ancient things. What I wanted was a
metal box which might be soldered, or a thick glass jar or bottle which
might be stoppered or sealed hermetically. Amongst miscellaneous heaps,
I found and purchased the latter article.

<p/>I then made a little roll of my letters, wrapped them in oiled silk,
bound them with twine, and, having put them in the bottle, got the old
Jew broker to stopper, seal, and make it air-tight. While obeying my
directions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) glanced at me now and then suspiciously from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
frost-white eyelashes. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) thought there was some evil deed on
hand. In all this I had a dreary something--not pleasure--but a sad,
lonely satisfaction. The impulse under which I acted, the mood
controlling me, were similar to the impulse and the mood which had
induced me to visit the confessional. With quick walking I regained the
pensionnat just at dark, and in time for dinner.

<p/>At seven o'clock the moon rose. At half-past seven, when the pupils and
teachers were at study, and Madame Beck was with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother and
children in the salle-à-manger, when the half-boarders were all gone
home, and Rosine had left the vestibule, and all was still--I shawled
myself, and, taking the sealed jar, stole out through the first-classe
door, into the berceau and thence into the <div class="bookquote">``allée défendue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Methusaleh, the pear-tree, stood at the further end of this walk, near
my seat: he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) rose up, dim and gray, above the lower shrubs round him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>).
Now Methusaleh, though so very old, was of sound timber still; only
there was a hole, or rather a deep hollow, near his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) root. I knew there
was such a hollow, hidden partly by ivy and creepers growing thick
round; and there I meditated hiding my treasure. But I was not only
going to hide a treasure--I meant also to bury a grief. That grief over
which I had lately been weeping, as I wrapped it in its winding-sheet,
must be interred.

<p/>Well, I cleared away the ivy, and found the hole; it was large enough
to receive the jar, and I thrust it deep in. In a tool-shed at the
bottom of the garden, lay the relics of building-materials, left by
masons lately employed to repair a part of the premises. I fetched
thence a slate and some mortar, put the slate on the hollow, secured it
with cement, covered the hole with black mould, and, finally, replaced
the ivy. This done, I rested, leaning against the tree; lingering, like
any other mourner, beside a newly-sodded grave.

<p/>The air of the night was very still, but dim with a peculiar mist,
which changed the moonlight into a luminous haze. In this air, or this
mist, there was some quality--electrical, perhaps--which acted in
strange sort upon me. I felt then as I had felt a year ago in
England--on a night when the aurora borealis was streaming and sweeping
round heaven, when, belated in lonely fields, I had paused to watch
that mustering of an army with banners--that quivering of serried
lances--that swift ascent of messengers from below the north star to
the dark, high keystone of heaven's arch. I felt, not happy, far
otherwise, but strong with reinforced strength.

<p/>If life be a war, it seemed my destiny to conduct it single-handed. I
pondered now how to break up my winter-quarters--to leave an encampment
where food and forage failed. Perhaps, to effect this change, another
pitched battle must be fought with fortune; if so, I had a mind to the
encounter: too poor to lose, God might destine me to gain. But what
road was open?--what plan available?

<p/>On this question I was still pausing, when the moon, so dim hitherto,
seemed to shine out somewhat brighter: a ray gleamed even white before
me, and a shadow became distinct and marked. I looked more narrowly, to
make out the cause of this well-defined contrast appearing a little
suddenly in the obscure alley: whiter and blacker it grew on my eye: it
took shape with instantaneous transformation. I stood about three yards
from a tall, sable-robed, snowy-veiled woman.

<p/>Five minutes passed. I neither fled nor shrieked. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was there still.
I spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you? and why do you come to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood mute. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no face--no features: all below her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brow was
masked with a white cloth; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had eyes, and they viewed me.

<p/>I felt, if not brave, yet a little desperate; and desperation will
often suffice to fill the post and do the work of courage. I advanced
one step. I stretched out my hand, for I meant to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed
to recede. I drew nearer: her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) recession, still silent, became swift. A
mass of shrubs, full-leaved evergreens, laurel and dense yew,
intervened between me and what I followed. Having passed that obstacle,
I looked and saw nothing. I waited. I said,--<div class="bookquote">``If you have any errand to
men, come back and deliver it.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Nothing spoke or re-appeared.

<p/>This time there was no Dr. John to whom to have recourse: there was no
one to whom I dared whisper the words, <div class="bookquote">``I have again seen the nun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>Paulina Mary sought my frequent presence in the Rue Crécy. In the old
Bretton days, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never professed herself fond of me, my
society had soon become to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a sort of unconscious necessary. I used
to notice that if I withdrew to my room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would speedily come
trotting after me, and opening the door and peeping in, say, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
little peremptory accent,--<div class="bookquote">``Come down. Why do you sit here by yourself?
You must come into the parlour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>In the same spirit she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) urged me now--<div class="bookquote">``Leave the Rue Fossette,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``and come and live with us. Papa would give you far more than
Madame Beck gives you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Home himself offered me a handsome sum--thrice my present
salary--if I would accept the office of companion to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) daughter. I
declined. I think I should have declined had I been poorer than I was,
and with scantier fund of resource, more stinted narrowness of future
prospect. I had not that vocation. I could teach; I could give lessons;
but to be either a private governess or a companion was unnatural to
me. Rather than fill the former post in any great house, I would
deliberately have taken a housemaid's place, bought a strong pair of
gloves, swept bedrooms and staircases, and cleaned stoves and locks, in
peace and independence. Rather than be a companion, I would have made
shirts and starved.

<p/>I was no bright lady's shadow--not Miss de Bassompierre's. Overcast
enough it was my nature often to be; of a subdued habit I was: but the
dimness and depression must both be voluntary--such as kept me docile
at my desk, in the midst of my now well-accustomed pupils in Madame
Beck's fist classe; or alone, at my own bedside, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) dormitory, or
in the alley and seat which were called mine, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) garden: my
qualifications were not convertible, nor adaptable; they could not be
made the foil of any gem, the adjunct of any beauty, the appendage of
any greatness in Christendom. Madame Beck and I, without assimilating,
understood each other well. I was not _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)_ companion, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)
children's governess; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) left me free: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) tied me to nothing--not to
herself--not even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) interests: once, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) had for a fortnight
been called from home by a near relation's illness, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) return,
all anxious and full of care about her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) establishment, lest something in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) absence should have gone wrong finding that matters had proceeded
much as usual, and that there was no evidence of glaring neglect--she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)
made each of the teachers a present, in acknowledgment of steadiness.
To my bedside she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) came at twelve o'clock at night, and told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) had
no present for me: <div class="bookquote">``I must make fidelity advantageous to the St.
Pierre,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``if I attempt to make it advantageous to you, there
will arise misunderstanding between us--perhaps separation. One thing,
however, I _can_ do to please you--leave you alone with your liberty:
c'est-ce que je ferai.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) word. Every slight shackle she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) had
ever laid on me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>), from that time, with quiet hand removed. Thus I
had pleasure in voluntarily respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) rules: gratification in
devoting double time, in taking double pains with the pupils she (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)
committed to my charge.

<p/>As to Mary de Bassompierre, I visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with pleasure, though I would
not live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). My visits soon taught me that it was unlikely even
my occasional and voluntary society would long be indispensable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
M. de Bassompierre, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) part, seemed impervious to this conjecture,
blind to this possibility; unconscious as any child to the signs, the
likelihoods, the fitful beginnings of what, when it drew to an end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)
might not approve.

<p/>Whether or not he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) would cordially approve, I used to speculate.
Difficult to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) was much taken up with scientific interests; keen,
intent, and somewhat oppugnant in what concerned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) favourite
pursuits, but unsuspicious and trustful in the ordinary affairs of
life. From all I could gather, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) seemed to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``daughterling''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as still but a child, and probably had not yet admitted the notion that
others might look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) in a different light: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) would speak of what
should be done when <div class="bookquote">``Polly''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was a woman, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should be grown up;
and <div class="bookquote">``Polly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>standing beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) chair, would sometimes smile and take
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) honoured head between her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little hands, and kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) iron-grey
locks; and, at other times, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would pout and toss her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) curls: but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
never said, <div class="bookquote">``Papa, I _am_ grown up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had different moods for different people. With her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
really was still a child, or child-like, affectionate, merry, and
playful. With me she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was serious, and as womanly as thought and feeling
could make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). With Mrs. Bretton she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was docile and reliant, but not
expansive. With Graham she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was shy, at present very shy; at moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
tried to be cold; on occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) endeavoured to shun him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) step
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) start; his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) entrance hushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); when he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) spoke, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) answers
failed of fluency; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) took leave, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) remained self-vexed and
disconcerted. Even her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) father noticed this demeanour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My little Polly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said once, <div class="bookquote">``you live too retired a life; if you
grow to be a woman with these shy manners, you will hardly be fitted
for society. You really make quite a stranger of Dr. Bretton: how is
this? Don't you remember that, as a little girl, you used to be rather
partial to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Rather_, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>echoed she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) slightly dry, yet gentle and
simple tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) now? What has he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. Y--e--s, I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) a little; but we are grown strange to
each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then rub it off, Polly; rub the rust and the strangeness off. Talk
away when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) is here, and have no fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)_ does not talk much. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) afraid of me, do you think, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, to be sure, what man would not be afraid of such a little silent
lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) some day not to mind my being silent. Say that it is my
way, and that I have no unfriendly intention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your way, you little chatter-box? So far from being your way, it is
only your whim!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll improve, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And very pretty was the grace with which, the next day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) tried to
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) word. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) make the effort to converse affably with Dr.
John on general topics. The attention called into her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) guest's face a
pleasurable glow; he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) with caution, and replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>)
softest tones, as if there was a kind of gossamer happiness hanging in
the air which he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) feared to disturb by drawing too deep a breath.
Certainly, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) timid yet earnest advance to friendship, it could not
be denied that there was a most exquisite and fairy charm.

<p/>When the Doctor was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) father's chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I keep my word, papa? Did I behave better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Polly behaved like a queen. I shall become quite proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) if
this improvement continues. By-and-by we shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) receiving my
guests with quite a calm, grand manner. Miss Lucy and I will have to
look about us, and polish up all our best airs and graces lest we
should be thrown into the shade. Still, Polly, there is a little
flutter, a little tendency to stammer now and then, and even, to lisp
as you lisped when you were six years old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>interrupted she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) indignantly, <div class="bookquote">``that can't be true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>``I appeal to Miss Lucy. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) not, in answering Dr. Bretton's
question as to whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had ever seen the palace of the Prince of
Bois l``Etang, say, <div class="bookquote">``yeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had been there `theveral' times?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, you are satirical, you are méchant! I can pronounce all the
letters of the alphabet as clearly as you can. But tell me this you are
very particular in making me be civil to Dr. Bretton, do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure: for old acquaintance sake I like him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>): then he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is a very
good son to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mother; besides being a kind-hearted fellow and clever
in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) profession: yes, the callant is well enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Callant_! Ah, Scotchman! Papa, is it the Edinburgh or the Aberdeen
accent you have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both, my pet, both: and doubtless the Glaswegian into the bargain. It
is that which enables me to speak French so well: a gude Scots tongue
always succeeds well at the French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_The_ French! Scotch again: incorrigible papa. You, too, need
schooling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Polly, you must persuade Miss Snowe to undertake both you and
me; to make you steady and womanly, and me refined and classical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M.</b></font>)</div><p/>The light in which M. de Bassompierre evidently regarded <div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe,''
 (<font color='red'><b>M.</b></font>)</div>used to occasion me much inward edification. What contradictory
attributes of character we sometimes find ascribed to us, according to
the eye with which we are viewed! Madame Beck esteemed me learned and
blue; Miss Fanshawe, caustic, ironic, and cynical; Mr. Home, a model
teacher, the essence of the sedate and discreet: somewhat conventional,
perhaps, too strict, limited, and scrupulous, but still the pink and
pattern of governess-correctness; whilst another person, Professor Paul
Emanuel, to wit, never lost an opportunity of intimating his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) opinion
that mine was rather a fiery and rash nature--adventurous, indocile,
and audacious. I smiled at them all. If any one knew me it was little
Paulina Mary.

<p/>As I would not be Paulina's nominal and paid companion, genial and
harmonious as I began to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) intercourse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) persuaded me to join
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) in some study, as a regular and settled means of sustaining
communication: she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) proposed the German language, which, like myself,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) found difficult of mastery. We agreed to take our lessons in the
Rue Crécy of the same mistress; this arrangement threw us together for
some hours of every week. M. de Bassompierre seemed quite pleased: it
perfectly met his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) approbation, that Madame Minerva Gravity should
associate a portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) leisure with that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) fair and dear child.

<p/>That other self-elected judge of mine, the professor in the Rue
Fossette, discovering by some surreptitious spying means, that I was no
longer so stationary as hitherto, but went out regularly at certain
hours of certain days, took it upon himself to place me under
surveillance. People said M. Emanuel had been brought up amongst
Jesuits. I should more readily have accredited this report had his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
manoeuvres been better masked. As it was, I doubted it. Never was a
more undisguised schemer, a franker, looser intriguer. He (<font color='blue'><b>schemer</b></font>) would analyze
his (<font color='blue'><b>schemer</b></font>) own machinations: elaborately contrive plots, and forthwith indulge
in explanatory boasts of their skill. I know not whether I was more
amused or provoked, by his (<font color='blue'><b>schemer</b></font>) stepping up to me one morning and whispering
solemnly that he (<font color='blue'><b>schemer</b></font>) ``had his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) eye on me: _he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)_ at least would discharge the
duty of a friend, and not leave me entirely to my own devices. My
proceedings seemed at present very unsettled: he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) did not know what to
make of them: he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) cousin Beck very much to blame in
suffering this sort of fluttering inconsistency in a teacher attached
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) house. What had a person devoted to a serious calling, that of
education, to do with Counts and Countesses, hotels and châteaux? To
him (<font color='blue'><b>Counts</b></font>), I seemed altogether `en l``air.<div class="bookquote">'' On his (<font color='blue'><b>schemer</b></font>) faith, he (<font color='blue'><b>schemer</b></font>) believed I went
out six days in the seven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said, <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur exaggerated. I certainly had enjoyed the advantage of
a little change lately, but not before it had become necessary; and the
privilege was by no means exercised in excess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``Necessary! How was it necessary? I was well enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Counts</b></font>) supposed?
Change necessary! He (<font color='blue'><b>Counts</b></font>) would recommend me to look at the Catholic
``religieuses,<div class="bookquote">'' and study _their_ lives. _They_ asked no change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am no judge of what expression crossed my face when he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) thus spoke,
but it was one which provoked him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) accused me of being reckless,
worldly, and epicurean; ambitious of greatness, and feverishly athirst
for the pomps and vanities of life. It seems I had no <div class="bookquote">``dévouement,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>no
<div class="bookquote">``récueillement''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in my character; no spirit of grace, faith, sacrifice,
or self-abasement. Feeling the inutility of answering these charges, I
mutely continued the correction of a pile of English exercises.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Counts</b></font>) could see in me nothing Christian: like many other Protestants, I
revelled in the pride and self-will of paganism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I slightly turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), nestling still closer under the wing of
silence.

<p/>A vague sound grumbled between his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) teeth; it could not surely be a
<div class="bookquote">``juron:''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was too religious for that; but I am certain I heard the
word _sacré_. Grievous to relate, the same word was repeated, with the
unequivocal addition of _mille_ something, when I passed him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) about two
hours afterwards in the corridor, prepared to go and take my German
lesson in the Rue Crécy. Never was a better little man, in some points,
than M. Paul: never, in others, a more waspish little despot.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>Our German mistress, Fräulein Anna Braun, was a worthy, hearty woman,
of about forty-five; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought, perhaps, to have lived in the days of
Queen Elizabeth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) habitually consumed, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) first and second
breakfasts, beer and beef: also, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) direct and downright Deutsch
nature seemed to suffer a sensation of cruel restraint from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
called our English reserve; though we thought we were very cordial with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>): but we did not slap her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) on the shoulder, and if we consented to
kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cheek, it was done quietly, and without any explosive smack.
These omissions oppressed and depressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) considerably; still, on the
whole, we got on very well. Accustomed to instruct foreign girls, who
hardly ever will think and study for themselves--who have no idea of
grappling with a difficulty, and overcoming it by dint of reflection or
application--our progress, which in truth was very leisurely, seemed to
astound her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). In her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes, we were a pair of glacial prodigies, cold,
proud, and preternatural.

<p/>The young Countess _was_ a little proud, a little fastidious: and
perhaps, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) native delicacy and beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had a right to these
feelings; but I think it was a total mistake to ascribe them to me. I
never evaded the morning salute, which Paulina would slip when she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
could; nor was a certain little manner of still disdain a weapon known
in my armoury of defence; whereas, Paulina always kept it clear, fine,
and bright, and any rough German sally called forth at once its steelly
glisten.

<p/>Honest Anna Braun, in some measure, felt this difference; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Braun</b></font>)
half-feared, half-worshipped Paulina, as a sort of dainty nymph--an
Undine--she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) took refuge with me, as a being all mortal, and of easier
mood.

<p/>A book we liked well to read and translate was Schiller's Ballads;
Paulina soon learned to read them beautifully; the Fräulein would
listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) with a broad smile of pleasure, and say her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) voice sounded
like music. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) translated them, too, with a facile flow of language,
and in a strain of kindred and poetic fervour: her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) cheek would flush,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lips tremblingly smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) beauteous eyes kindle or melt as she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
went on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) learnt the best by heart, and would often recite them when
we were alone together. One she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) liked well was <div class="bookquote">``Des Mädchens Klage:''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) liked well to repeat the words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) found plaintive melody
in the sound; the sense she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) would criticise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) murmured, as we sat
over the fire one evening:--

<p/>Du Heilige, rufe dein Kind zurück,
Ich habe genossen das irdische Glück,
Ich habe gelebt und geliebet!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lived and loved!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is that the summit of earthly happiness,
the end of life--to love? I don't think it is. It may be the extreme of
mortal misery, it may be sheer waste of time, and fruitless torture of
feeling. If Schiller had said to _be_ loved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) might have come nearer
the truth. Is not that another thing, Lucy, to be loved?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it may be: but why consider the subject? What is love to
you? What do you know about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) crimsoned, half in irritation, half in shame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I won't take that from you. It may be well for
papa to look on me as a baby: I rather prefer that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should thus view
me; but _you_ know and shall learn to acknowledge that I am verging on
my nineteenth year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter if it were your twenty-ninth; we will anticipate no feelings
by discussion and conversation; we will not talk about love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)--all in hurry and heat--<div class="bookquote">``you may think to
check and hold me in, as much as you please; but I _have_ talked about
it, and heard about it too; and a great deal and lately, and
disagreeably and detrimentally: and in a way you wouldn't approve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And the vexed, triumphant, pretty, naughty being laughed. I could not
discern what she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) meant, and I would not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>): I was nonplussed.
Seeing, however, the utmost innocence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) countenance--combined with
some transient perverseness and petulance--I said at last,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who talks to you disagreeably and detrimentally on such matters? Who
that has near access to you would dare to do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>replied she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) more softly, <div class="bookquote">``it is a person who makes me miserable
sometimes; and I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would keep away--I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But who, Paulina, can it be? You puzzle me much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is--it is my cousin Ginevra. Every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) has leave to visit Mrs.
Cholmondeley she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) calls here, and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) finds me alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) begins
to talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) admirers. Love, indeed! You should hear all she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) has
to say about love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have heard it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, quite coolly; <div class="bookquote">``and on the whole, perhaps
it is as well you should have heard it too: it is not to be regretted,
it is all right. Yet, surely, Ginevra's mind cannot influence yours.
You can look over both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) head and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) does influence me very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) has the art of disturbing my
happiness and unsettling my opinions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) hurts me through the feelings
and people dearest to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) say, Paulina? Give me some idea. There may be
counteraction of the damage done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The people I have longest and most esteemed are degraded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I daresay: and how does she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) mix up these with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) sentiment and

or slavish? Day after day she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shows him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) to me kneeling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feet,
pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) shadow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)--repulsing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) with insult, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)

amidst such a party. I could not talk to Messieurs A-- and Z--, the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVII.

<p/>THE HÔTEL CRÉCY.


<p/>The morrow turned out a more lively and busy day than we--or than I, at
least--had anticipated. It seems it was the birthday of one of the young
princes of Labassecour--the eldest, I think, the Duc de Dindonneau, and
a general holiday was given in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) honour at the schools, and
especially at the principal <div class="bookquote">``Athénée,''  (<font color='red'><b>the principal Athénée</b></font>)</div>or college. The youth of that
institution had also concocted, and were to present a loyal address;
for which purpose they were to be assembled in the public building
where the yearly examinations were conducted, and the prizes
distributed. After the ceremony of presentation, an oration, or
<div class="bookquote">``discours,''  (<font color='red'><b>the professors</b></font>)</div>was to follow from one of the professors.

<p/>Several of M. de Bassompierre's friends--the savants-being more or less
connected with the Athénée, they were expected to attend on this
occasion; together with the worshipful municipality of Villette, M. le
Chevalier Staas, the burgomaster, and the parents and kinsfolk of the
Athenians in general. M. de Bassompierre was engaged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) friends to
accompany them; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) fair daughter would, of course, be of the party,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wrote a little note to Ginevra and myself, bidding us come
early that we might join her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>).

<p/>As Miss Fanshawe and I were dressing in the dormitory of the Rue
Fossette, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) -LRB-Miss F.-RRB- suddenly burst into a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had suspended the operation of arranging
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) attire, and was gazing at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems so odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) replied, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) usual half-honest
half-insolent unreserve, <div class="bookquote">``that you and I should now be so much on a
level, visiting in the same sphere; having the same connections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``I had not much respect for the connections you
chiefly frequented awhile ago: Mrs. Cholmondeley and Co. would never
have suited me at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who _are_ you, Miss Snowe?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) inquired, in a tone of such
undisguised and unsophisticated curiosity, as made me laugh in my turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You used to call yourself a nursery governess; when you first came
here you really had the care of the children in this house: I have seen
you carry little Georgette in your arms, like a bonne--few governesses
would have condescended so far--and now Madame Beck treats you with
more courtesy than she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) treats the Parisienne, St. Pierre; and that
proud chit, my cousin, makes you her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) bosom friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonderful!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed, much amused at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) mystification. <div class="bookquote">``Who am I
indeed? Perhaps a personage in disguise. Pity I don't look the
character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you are not more flattered by all this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``you
take it with strange composure. If you really are the nobody I once
thought you, you must be a cool hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The nobody you once thought me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated, and my face grew a little
hot; but I would not be angry: of what importance was a school-girl's
crude use of the terms nobody and somebody? I confined myself,
therefore, to the remark that I had merely met with civility; and asked
<div class="bookquote">``what she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgette</b></font>) saw in civility to throw the recipient into a fever of
confusion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can't help wondering at some things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) persisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wondering at marvels of your own manufacture. Are you ready at last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; let me take your arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather not: we will walk side by side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) took my arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) always leaned upon me her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) whole weight; and,
as I was not a gentleman, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) lover, I did not like it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, again!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I thought, by offering to take your arm, to
intimate approbation of your dress and general appearance: I meant it
as a compliment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did? You meant, in short, to express that you are not ashamed to
be seen in the street with me? That if Mrs. Cholmondeley should be
fondling her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) lapdog at some window, or Colonel de Hamal picking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>)
teeth in a balcony, and should catch a glimpse of us, you would not
quite blush for your companion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), with that directness which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) best point--which
gave an honest plainness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) very fibs when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) told them--which
was, in short, the salt, the sole preservative ingredient of a
character otherwise not formed to keep.

<p/>I delegated the trouble of commenting on this <div class="bookquote">``yes''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>to my countenance;
or rather, my under-lip voluntarily anticipated my tongue of course,
reverence and solemnity were not the feelings expressed in the look I
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scornful, sneering creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) went on, as we crossed a great
square, and entered the quiet, pleasant park, our nearest way to the
Rue Crécy. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody in this world was ever such a Turk to me as you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You bring it on yourself: let me alone: have the sense to be quiet: I
will let you alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if one _could_ let you alone, when you are so peculiar and so
mysterious!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The mystery and peculiarity being entirely the conception of your own
brain--maggots--neither more nor less, be so good as to keep them out
of my sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But _are_ you anybody?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>persevered she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) hand, in spite of
me, under my arm; and that arm pressed itself with inhospitable
closeness against my side, by way of keeping out the intruder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``I am a rising character: once an old lady's companion,
then a nursery-governess, now a school-teacher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do--_do_ tell me who you are? I'll not repeat it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) urged, adhering
with ludicrous tenacity to the wise notion of an incognito she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had got
hold of; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) squeezed the arm of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had now obtained full
possession, and coaxed and conjured till I was obliged to pause in the
park to laugh. Throughout our walk she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) rang the most fanciful changes
on this theme; proving, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) obstinate credulity, or incredulity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
incapacity to conceive how any person not bolstered up by birth or
wealth, not supported by some consciousness of name or connection,
could maintain an attitude of reasonable integrity. As for me, it quite
sufficed to my mental tranquillity that I was known where it imported
that known I should be; the rest sat on me easily: pedigree, social
position, and recondite intellectual acquisition, occupied about the
same space and place in my interests and thoughts; they were my
third-class lodgers--to whom could be assigned only the small
sitting-room and the little back bedroom: even if the dining and
drawing-rooms stood empty, I never confessed it to them, as thinking
minor accommodations better suited to their circumstances. The world, I
soon learned, held a different estimate: and I make no doubt, the world
is very right in its view, yet believe also that I am not quite wrong
in mine.

<p/>There are people whom a lowered position degrades morally, to whom loss
of connection costs loss of self-respect: are not these justified in
placing the highest value on that station and association which is
their safeguard from debasement? If a man feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would become
contemptible in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own eyes were it generally known that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ancestry
were simple and not gentle, poor and not rich, workers and not
capitalists, would it be right severely to blame him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for keeping these
fatal facts out of sight--for starting, trembling, quailing at the
chance which threatens exposure? The longer we live, the more out
experience widens; the less prone are we to judge our neighbour's
conduct, to question the world's wisdom: wherever an accumulation of
small defences is found, whether surrounding the prude's virtue or the
man of the world's respectability, there, be sure, it is needed.

<p/>We reached the Hôtel Crécy; Paulina was ready; Mrs. Bretton was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); and, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) escort and that of M. de Bassompierre, we were soon
conducted to the place of assembly, and seated in good seats, at a
convenient distance from the Tribune. The youth of the Athénée were
marshalled before us, the municipality and their bourgmestre were in
places of honour, the young princes, with their tutors, occupied a
conspicuous position, and the body of the building was crowded with the
aristocracy and first burghers of the town.

<p/>Concerning the identity of the professor by whom the <div class="bookquote">``discours''  (<font color='red'><b>the professor</b></font>)</div>was to
be delivered, I had as yet entertained neither care nor question. Some
vague expectation I had that a savant would stand up and deliver a
formal speech, half dogmatism to the Athenians, half flattery to the
princes.

<p/>The Tribune was yet empty when we entered, but in ten minutes after it
was filled; suddenly, in a second of time, a head, chest, and arms grew
above the crimson desk. This head I knew: its colour, shape, port,
expression, were familiar both to me and Miss Fanshawe; the blackness
and closeness of cranium, the amplitude and paleness of brow, the
blueness and fire of glance, were details so domesticated in the
memory, and so knit with many a whimsical association, as almost by
this their sudden apparition, to tickle fancy to a laugh. Indeed, I
confess, for my part, I did laugh till I was warm; but then I bent my
head, and made my handkerchief and a lowered veil the sole confidants
of my mirth.

<p/>I think I was glad to see M. Paul; I think it was rather pleasant than
otherwise, to behold him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) set up there, fierce and frank, dark and
candid, testy and fearless, as when regnant on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) estrade in class.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) presence was such a surprise: I had not once thought of expecting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), though I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) filled the chair of Belles Lettres in the
college. With _him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)_ in that Tribune, I felt sure that neither formalism
nor flattery would be our doom; but for what was vouchsafed us, for
what was poured suddenly, rapidly, continuously, on our heads--I own I
was not prepared.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spoke to the princes, the nobles, the magistrates, and the burghers,
with just the same ease, with almost the same pointed, choleric
earnestness, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was wont to harangue the three divisions of
the Rue Fossette. The collegians he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) addressed, not as schoolboys, but
as future citizens and embryo patriots. The times which have since come
on Europe had not been foretold yet, and M. Emanuel's spirit seemed new
to me. Who would have thought the flat and fat soil of Labassecour
could yield political convictions and national feelings, such as were
now strongly expressed? Of the bearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) opinions I need here give
no special indication; yet it may be permitted me to say that I
believed the little man not more earnest than right in what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said:
with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fire he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was severe and sensible; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trampled Utopian
theories under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heel; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rejected wild dreams with scorn;--but when
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked in the face of tyranny--oh, then there opened a light in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eye worth seeing; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke of injustice, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice gave no
uncertain sound, but reminded me rather of the band-trumpet, ringing at
twilight from the park.

<p/>I do not think his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) audience were generally susceptible of sharing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
flame in its purity; but some of the college youth caught fire as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eloquently told them what should be their path and endeavour in their
country's and in Europe's future. They gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a long, loud, ringing
cheer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) concluded: with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fierceness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was their favourite
professor.

<p/>As our party left the Hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood at the entrance; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw and knew
me, and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand in passing, and uttered the
words <div class="bookquote">``Qu'en dites vous?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--question eminently characteristic, and
reminding me, even in this his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moment of triumph, of that inquisitive
restlessness, that absence of what I considered desirable self-control,
which were amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faults. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not have cared just then to
ask what I thought, or what anybody thought, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _did_ care, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was too natural to conceal, too impulsive to repress his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wish. Well! if
I blamed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over-eagerness, I liked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _naiveté_. I would have
praised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): I had plenty of praise in my heart; but, alas! no words on
my lips. Who _has_ words at the right moment? I stammered some lame
expressions; but was truly glad when other people, coming up with
profuse congratulations, covered my deficiency by their redundancy.

<p/>A gentleman introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to M. de Bassompierre; and the Count, who
had likewise been highly gratified, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) friends -LRB-for
the most part M. Emanuel's likewise-RRB-, and to dine with them at the
Hôtel Crécy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) declined dinner, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was a man always somewhat shy
at meeting the advances of the wealthy: there was a strength of sturdy
independence in the stringing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) sinews--not obtrusive, but
pleasant enough to discover as one advanced in knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
character; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) promised, however, to step in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) friend, M. A--,
a French Academician, in the course of the evening.

<p/>At dinner that day, Ginevra and Paulina each looked, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) own way,
very beautiful; the former, perhaps, boasted the advantage in material
charms, but the latter shone pre-eminent for attractions more subtle
and spiritual: for light and eloquence of eye, for grace of mien, for
winning variety of expression. Ginevra's dress of deep crimson relieved
well her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) light curls, and harmonized with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) rose-like bloom.
Paulina's attire--in fashion close, though faultlessly neat, but in
texture clear and white--made the eye grateful for the delicate life of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) complexion, for the soft animation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) countenance, for the
tender depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) eyes, for the brown shadow and bounteous flow of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) hair--darker than that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) Saxon cousin, as were also her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>)
eyebrows, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) eyelashes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) full irids, and large mobile pupils.
Nature having traced all these details slightly, and with a careless
hand, in Miss Fanshawe's case; and in Miss de Bassompierre's, wrought
them to a high and delicate finish.

<p/>Paulina was awed by the savants, but not quite to mutism: she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) conversed
modestly, diffidently; not without effort, but with so true a
sweetness, so fine and penetrating a sense, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) father more than
once suspended his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own discourse to listen, and fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) an eye of
proud delight. It was a polite Frenchman, M. Z--, a very learned, but
quite a courtly man, who had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) into discourse. I was charmed
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) French; it was faultless--the structure correct, the idioms
true, the accent pure; Ginevra, who had lived half her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) life on the
Continent, could do nothing like it not that words ever failed Miss
Fanshawe, but real accuracy and purity she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) neither possessed, nor in
any number of years would acquire. Here, too, M. de Bassompierre was
gratified; for, on the point of language, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) was critical.

<p/>Another listener and observer there was; one who, detained by some
exigency of his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) profession, had come in late to dinner. Both ladies
were quietly scanned by Dr. Bretton, at the moment of taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) seat
at the table; and that guarded survey was more than once renewed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
arrival roused Miss Fanshawe, who had hitherto appeared listless: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
now became smiling and complacent, talked--though what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) said was
rarely to the purpose--or rather, was of a purpose somewhat
mortifyingly below the standard of the occasion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) light,
disconnected prattle might have gratified Graham once; perhaps it
pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) still: perhaps it was only fancy which suggested the
thought that, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eye was filled and his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) ear fed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) taste, his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
keen zest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) lively intelligence, were not equally consulted and
regaled. It is certain that, restless and exacting as seemed the demand
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) attention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) yielded courteously all that was required: his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
manner showed neither pique nor coolness: Ginevra was his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) neighbour,
and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>), during dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) almost exclusively confined his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) notice.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) appeared satisfied, and passed to the drawing-room in very good
spirits.

<p/>Yet, no sooner had we reached that place of refuge, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) again
became flat and listless: throwing herself on a couch, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) denounced
both the <div class="bookquote">``discours''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and the dinner as stupid affairs, and inquired of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) cousin how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) could hear such a set of prosaic <div class="bookquote">``gros-bonnets''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) father gathered about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The moment the gentlemen were heard to
move, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) railings ceased: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) started up, flew to the piano, and
dashed at it with spirit. Dr. Bretton entering, one of the first, took
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) station beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>). I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) would not long maintain that
post: there was a position near the hearth to which I expected to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) attracted: this position he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) only scanned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) eye; while _he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)_
looked, others drew in. The grace and mind of Paulina charmed these
thoughtful Frenchmen: the fineness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) beauty, the soft courtesy of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) immature, but real and inbred tact, pleased their
national taste; they clustered about her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), not indeed to talk science;
which would have rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) dumb, but to touch on many subjects in
letters, in arts, in actual life, on which it soon appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
had both read and reflected. I listened. I am sure that though Graham
stood aloof, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) listened too: his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) hearing as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) vision was
very fine, quick, discriminating. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) gathered the conversation;
I felt that the mode in which it was sustained suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
exquisitely--pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) almost to pain.

<p/>In Paulina there was more force, both of feeling and character; than
most people thought--than Graham himself imagined--than she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) would ever
show to those who did not wish to see it. To speak truth, reader, there
is no excellent beauty, no accomplished grace, no reliable refinement,
without strength as excellent, as complete, as trustworthy. As well
might you look for good fruit and blossom on a rootless and sapless
tree, as for charms that will endure in a feeble and relaxed nature.
For a little while, the blooming semblance of beauty may flourish round
weakness; but it cannot bear a blast: it soon fades, even in serenest
sunshine. Graham would have started had any suggestive spirit whispered
of the sinew and the stamina sustaining that delicate nature; but I who
had known her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as a child, knew or guessed by what a good and strong
root her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) graces held to the firm soil of reality.

<p/>While Dr. Bretton listened, and waited an opening in the magic circle,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) glance restlessly sweeping the room at intervals, lighted by chance
on me, where I sat in a quiet nook not far from my godmother and M. de
Bassompierre, who, as usual, were engaged in what Mr. Home called <div class="bookquote">``a
two-handed crack:''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Home</b></font>)</div>what the Count would have interpreted as a
tête-à-tête. Graham smiled recognition, crossed the room, asked me how
I was, told me I looked pale. I also had my own smile at my own
thought: it was now about three months since Dr. John had spoken to
me--a lapse of which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not even conscious. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sat down, and became
silent. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wish was rather to look than converse. Ginevra and Paulina
were now opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could gaze his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fill: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) surveyed both
forms--studied both faces.

<p/>Several new guests, ladies as well as gentlemen, had entered the room
since dinner, dropping in for the evening conversation; and amongst the
gentlemen, I may incidentally observe, I had already noticed by
glimpses, a severe, dark, professorial outline, hovering aloof in an
inner saloon, seen only in vista. M. Emanuel knew many of the gentlemen
present, but I think was a stranger to most of the ladies, excepting
myself; in looking towards the hearth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) could not but see me, and
naturally made a movement to approach; seeing, however, Dr. Bretton
also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mind and held back. If that had been all, there
would have been no cause for quarrel; but not satisfied with holding
back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) puckered up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) eyebrows, protruded his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) lip, and looked so
ugly that I averted my eyes from the displeasing spectacle. M. Joseph
Emanuel had arrived, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) austere brother, and at this very
moment was relieving Ginevra at the piano. What a master-touch
succeeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) school-girl jingle! In what grand, grateful tones the
instrument acknowledged the hand of the true artist!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>began Dr. Bretton, breaking silence and smiling, as Ginevra
glided before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), casting a glance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) passed by, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Fanshawe is
certainly a fine girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course I assented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``another in the room as lovely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think there is not another as handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I agree with you, Lucy: you and I do often agree in opinion, in taste,
I think; or at least in judgment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do we?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, somewhat doubtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe if you had been a boy, Lucy, instead of a girl--my mother's
god-son instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) god-daughter, we should have been good friends:
our opinions would have melted into each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had assumed a bantering air: a light, half-caressing, half-ironic,
shone aslant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) eye. Ah, Graham! I have given more than one
solitary moment to thoughts and calculations of your estimate of Lucy
Snowe: was it always kind or just? Had Lucy been intrinsically the same
but possessing the additional advantages of wealth and station, would
your manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), your value for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), have been quite what they
actually were? And yet by these questions I would not seriously infer
blame. No; you might sadden and trouble me sometimes; but then mine was
a soon-depressed, an easily-deranged temperament--it fell if a cloud
crossed the sun. Perhaps before the eye of severe equity I should stand
more at fault than you.

<p/>Trying, then, to keep down the unreasonable pain which thrilled my
heart, on thus being made to feel that while Graham could devote to
others the most grave and earnest, the manliest interest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had no
more than light raillery for Lucy, the friend of lang syne, I inquired
calmly,--<div class="bookquote">``On what points are we so closely in accordance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We each have an observant faculty. You, perhaps, don't give me credit
for the possession; yet I have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you were speaking of tastes: we may see the same objects, yet
estimate them differently?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us bring it to the test. Of course, you cannot but render homage
to the merits of Miss Fanshawe: now, what do you think of others in the
room?--my mother, for instance; or the lions yonder, Messieurs A--
and Z--; or, let us say, that pale little lady, Miss de Bassompierre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what I think of your mother. I have not thought of Messieurs
A-- and Z--.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is, as you say, a pale little lady--pale, certainly, just
now, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is fatigued with over-excitement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't remember her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as a child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder, sometimes, whether you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); but it is noticeable, that circumstances,
persons, even words and looks, that had slipped your memory, may, under
certain conditions, certain aspects of your own or another's mind,
revive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is possible enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``the revival is imperfect--needs confirmation,
partakes so much of the dim character of a dream, or of the airy one of
a fancy, that the testimony of a witness becomes necessary for
corroboration. Were you not a guest at Bretton ten years ago, when Mr.
Home brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) little girl, whom we then called `little Polly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to
stay with mamma?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was there the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) came, and also the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) went away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather a peculiar child, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) not? I wonder how I treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>). Was
I fond of children in those days? Was there anything gracious or kindly
about me--great, reckless, schoolboy as I was? But you don't recollect
me, of course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen your own picture at La Terrasse. It is like you
personally. In manner, you were almost the same yesterday as to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Lucy, how is that? Such an oracle really whets my curiosity. What
am I to-day? What was I the yesterday of ten years back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious to whatever pleased you--unkindly or cruel to nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are wrong; I think I was almost a brute to _you_, for
instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A brute! No, Graham: I should never have patiently endured brutality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_This_, however, I _do_ remember: quiet Lucy Snowe tasted nothing of
my grace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As little of your cruelty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, had I been Nero himself, I could not have tormented a being
inoffensive as a shadow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I smiled; but I also hushed a groan. Oh!--I just wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would let me
alone--cease allusion to me. These epithets--these attributes I put
from me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``quiet Lucy Snowe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``inoffensive shadow,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
back; not with scorn, but with extreme weariness: theirs was the
coldness and the pressure of lead; let him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) whelm me with no such
weight. Happily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was soon on another theme.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On what terms were `little Polly' and I? Unless my recollections
deceive me, we were not foes--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak very vaguely. Do you think little Polly's memory, not more
definite?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! we don't talk of `little Polly' _now_. Pray say, Miss de
Bassompierre; and, of course, such a stately personage remembers
nothing of Bretton. Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) large eyes, Lucy; can they read a word
in the page of memory? Are they the same which I used to direct to a
horn-book? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) does not know that I partly taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the Bible on Sunday nights?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) has a calm, delicate, rather fine profile now: once what a little
restless, anxious countenance was hers! What a thing is a child's
preference--what a bubble! Would you believe it? that lady was fond of
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in some measure fond of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, moderately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't remember then? _I_ had forgotten; but I remember _now_. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
liked me the best of whatever there was at Bretton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite well recall it. I wish I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) all I recall; or
rather, I wish some one, you for instance, would go behind and whisper
it all in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ear, and I could have the delight--here, as I sit--of
watching her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) look under the intelligence. Could you manage that, think
you, Lucy, and make me ever grateful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could I manage to make you ever grateful?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``No, _I could
not_.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>And I felt my fingers work and my hands interlock: I felt, too,
an inward courage, warm and resistant. In this matter I was not
disposed to gratify Dr. John: not at all. With now welcome force, I
realized his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entire misapprehension of my character and nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
wanted always to give me a role not mine. Nature and I opposed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
did not at all guess what I felt: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not read my eyes, or face, or
gestures; though, I doubt not, all spoke. Leaning towards me coaxingly,
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, softly, <div class="bookquote">''_Do_ content me, Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And I would have contented, or, at least, I would clearly have
enlightened him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and taught him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) well never again to expect of me the
part of officious soubrette in a love drama; when, following his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), soft,
eager, murmur, meeting almost his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pleading, mellow--<div class="bookquote">''_Do_ content me,
Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>a sharp hiss pierced my ear on the other side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Petite chatte, doucerette, coquette!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sibillated the sudden
boa-constrictor; <div class="bookquote">``vous avez l'air bien triste, soumis, rêveur, mais
vous ne l'êtes pas: c'est moi qui vous le dis: Sauvage! la flamme à
l'âme, l'éclair aux yeux!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oui; j'ai la flamme à l'âme, et je dois l'avoir!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>retorted I, turning
in just wrath: but Professor Emanuel had hissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) insult and was gone.

<p/>The worst of the matter was, that Dr. Bretton, whose ears, as I have
said, were quick and fine, caught every word of this apostrophe; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) handkerchief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) face, and laughed till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) shook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``capital! petite chatte, petite coquette!
Oh, I must tell my mother! Is it true, Lucy, or half-true? I believe it
is: you redden to the colour of Miss Fanshawe's gown. And really, by my
word, now I examine him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), that is the same little man who was so savage
with you at the concert: the very same, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is frantic
at this moment because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees me laughing. Oh! I must tease him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And Graham, yielding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) bent for mischief, laughed, jested, and
whispered on till I could bear no more, and my eyes filled.

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was sobered: a vacant space appeared near Miss de
Bassompierre; the circle surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) seemed about to dissolve. This
movement was instantly caught by Graham's eye--ever-vigilant, even
while laughing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) rose, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) courage in both hands, crossed the
room, and made the advantage his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) own. Dr. John, throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) whole
life, was a man of luck--a man of success. And why? Because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had the
eye to see his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) opportunity, the heart to prompt to well-timed action,
the nerve to consummate a perfect work. And no tyrant-passion dragged
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) back; no enthusiasms, no foibles encumbered his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way. How well he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
looked at this very moment! When Paulina looked up as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
side, her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) glance mingled at once with an encountering glance, animated,
yet modest; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) colour, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), became half a blush, half a
glow. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) presence brave and bashful: subdued and
unobtrusive, yet decided in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) purpose and devoted in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ardour. I
gathered all this by one view. I did not prolong my observation--time
failed me, had inclination served: the night wore late; Ginevra and I
ought already to have been in the Rue Fossette. I rose, and bade
good-night to my godmother and M. de Bassompierre.

<p/>I know not whether Professor Emanuel had noticed my reluctant
acceptance of Dr. Bretton's badinage, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) perceived that I
was pained, and that, on the whole, the evening had not been one flow
of exultant enjoyment for the volatile, pleasure-loving Mademoiselle
Lucie; but, as I was leaving the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) stepped up and inquired
whether I had any one to attend me to the Rue Fossette. The professor
_now_ spoke politely, and even deferentially, and he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) looked apologetic
and repentant; but I could not recognise his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) civility at a word, nor
meet his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) contrition with crude, premature oblivion. Never hitherto had
I felt seriously disposed to resent his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) brusqueries, or freeze before
his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) fierceness; what he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) had said to-night, however, I considered
unwarranted: my extreme disapprobation of the proceeding must be
marked, however slightly. I merely said:--<div class="bookquote">``I am provided with
attendance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Which was true, as Ginevra and I were to be sent home in the carriage;
and I passed him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) with the sliding obeisance with which he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) was wont to
be saluted in classe by pupils crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) estrade.

<p/>Having sought my shawl, I returned to the vestibule. M. Emanuel stood
there as if waiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) observed that the night was fine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, with a tone and manner whose consummate chariness and
frostiness I could not but applaud. It was so seldom I could properly
act out my own resolution to be reserved and cool where I had been
grieved or hurt, that I felt almost proud of this one successful
effort. That <div class="bookquote">``Is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>sounded just like the manner of other people. I
had heard hundreds of such little minced, docked, dry phrases, from the
pursed-up coral lips of a score of self-possessed, self-sufficing
misses and mesdemoiselles. That M. Paul would not stand any prolonged
experience of this sort of dialogue I knew; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) certainly merited a
sample of the curt and arid. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought so himself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
took the dose quietly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked at my shawl and objected to its
lightness. I decidedly told him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) it was as heavy as I wished. Receding
aloof, and standing apart, I leaned on the banister of the stairs,
folded my shawl about me, and fixed my eyes on a dreary religious
painting darkening the wall.

<p/>Ginevra was long in coming: tedious seemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) loitering. M. Paul was
still there; my ear expected from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips an angry tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came
nearer. <div class="bookquote">``Now for another hiss!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I: had not the action been too
uncivil I could have, stopped my ears with my fingers in terror of the
thrill. Nothing happens as we expect: listen for a coo or a murmur; it
is then you will hear a cry of prey or pain. Await a piercing shriek,
an angry threat, and welcome an amicable greeting, a low kind whisper.
M. Paul spoke gently:--<div class="bookquote">``Friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do not quarrel for a word.
Tell me, was it I or ce grand fat d'Anglais''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-so he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) profanely
denominated Dr. Bretton-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``who made your eyes so humid, and your cheeks
so hot as they are even now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not conscious of you, monsieur, or of any other having excited
such emotion as you indicate,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was my answer; and in giving it, I again
surpassed my usual self, and achieved a neat, frosty falsehood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did I say?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) pursued; <div class="bookquote">``tell me: I was angry: I have
forgotten my words; what were they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such as it is best to forget!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, still quite calm and chill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it was _my_ words which wounded you? Consider them unsaid: permit
my retractation; accord my pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not angry, Monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are worse than angry--grieved. Forgive me, Miss Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``M. Emanuel, I _do_ forgive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Let me hear you say, in the voice natural to you, and not in that
alien tone, <div class="bookquote">``Mon ami, je vous pardonne.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) made me smile. Who could help smiling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) wistfulness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
simplicity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) earnestness?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bon!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Voilà que le jour va poindre! Dites donc, mon ami.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Paul, je vous pardonne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will have no monsieur: speak the other word, or I shall not believe
you sincere: another effort--_mon ami_, or else in English,--my friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, <div class="bookquote">``my friend''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>had rather another sound and significancy than <div class="bookquote">''_mon
ami_;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>it did not breathe the same sense of domestic and intimate
affection; <div class="bookquote">''_mon ami_''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could _not_ say to M. Paul; <div class="bookquote">``my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>I
could, and did say without difficulty. This distinction existed not for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was quite satisfied with the English phrase. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
smiled. You should have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) smile, reader; and you should have
marked the difference between his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) countenance now, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wore
half an hour ago. I cannot affirm that I had ever witnessed the smile
of pleasure, or content, or kindness round M. Paul's lips, or in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
eyes before. The ironic, the sarcastic, the disdainful, the
passionately exultant, I had hundreds of times seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) express by what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) called a smile, but any illuminated sign of milder or warmer
feelings struck me as wholly new in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) visage. It changed it as from a
mask to a face: the deep lines left his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) features; the very complexion
seemed clearer and fresher; that swart, sallow, southern darkness which
spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) Spanish blood, became displaced by a lighter hue. I know not
that I have ever seen in any other human face an equal metamorphosis
from a similar cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) now took me to the carriage: at the same
moment M. de Bassompierre came out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) niece.

<p/>In a pretty humour was Mistress Fanshawe; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had found the evening a
grand failure: completely upset as to temper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) gave way to the most
uncontrolled moroseness as soon as we were seated, and the
carriage-door closed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) invectives against Dr. Bretton had something
venomous in them. Having found herself impotent either to charm or
sting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), hatred was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) only resource; and this hatred she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) expressed
in terms so unmeasured and proportion so monstrous, that, after
listening for a while with assumed stoicism, my outraged sense of
justice at last and suddenly caught fire. An explosion ensued: for I
could be passionate, too; especially with my present fair but faulty
associate, who never failed to stir the worst dregs of me. It was well
that the carriage-wheels made a tremendous rattle over the flinty
Choseville pavement, for I can assure the reader there was neither dead
silence nor calm discussion within the vehicle. Half in earnest, half
in seeming, I made it my business to storm down Ginevra. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) had set
out rampant from the Rue Crécy; it was necessary to tame her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) before we
reached the Rue Fossette: to this end it was indispensable to show up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) sterling value and high deserts; and this must be done in language
of which the fidelity and homeliness might challenge comparison with
the compliments of a John Knox to a Mary Stuart. This was the right
discipline for Ginevra; it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). I am quite sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went to bed
that night all the better and more settled in mind and mood, and slept
all the more sweetly for having undergone a sound moral drubbing.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII.

<p/>THE WATCHGUARD.


<p/>M. Paul Emanuel owned an acute sensitiveness to the annoyance of
interruption, from whatsoever cause occurring, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lessons: to
pass through the classe under such circumstances was considered by the
teachers and pupils of the school, individually and collectively, to be
as much as a woman's or girl's life was worth.

<p/>Madame Beck herself, if forced to the enterprise, would <div class="bookquote">``skurry''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Beck/Beck</b></font>)</div>through, retrenching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) skirts, and carefully coasting the formidable
estrade, like a ship dreading breakers. As to Rosine, the portress--on
whom, every half-hour, devolved the fearful duty of fetching pupils out
of the very heart of one or other of the divisions to take their
music-lessons in the oratory, the great or little saloon, the
salle-à-manger, or some other piano-station--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) second
or third attempt, frequently become almost tongue-tied from excess of
consternation--a sentiment inspired by the unspeakable looks levelled
at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) through a pair of dart-dealing spectacles.

<p/>One morning I was sitting in the carré, at work upon a piece of
embroidery which one of the pupils had commenced but delayed to finish,
and while my fingers wrought at the frame, my ears regaled themselves
with listening to the crescendos and cadences of a voice haranguing in
the neighbouring classe, in tones that waxed momentarily more unquiet,
more ominously varied. There was a good strong partition-wall between
me and the gathering storm, as well as a facile means of flight through
the glass-door to the court, in case it swept this way; so I am afraid
I derived more amusement than alarm from these thickening symptoms.
Poor Rosine was not safe: four times that blessed morning had she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) made
the passage of peril; and now, for the fifth time, it became her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
dangerous duty to snatch, as it were, a brand from the burning--a pupil
from under M. Paul's nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Que vais-je devenir? Monsieur va me
tuer, je suis sûre; car il est d'une colère!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Nerved by the courage of desperation, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle La Malle au piano!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) cry.

<p/>Ere she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) could make good her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) retreat, or quite close the door, this
voice uttered itself:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dès ce moment!--la classe est défendue. La première qui ouvrira cette
porte, ou passera par cette division, sera pendue--fut-ce Madame Beck
elle-même!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ten minutes had not succeeded the promulgation of this decree when
Rosine's French pantoufles were again heard shuffling along the
corridor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I would not for a five-franc piece go into
that classe again just now: Monsieur's lunettes are really terrible;
and here is a commissionaire come with a message from the Athénée. I
have told Madame Beck I dare not deliver it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) says I am to
charge you with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me? No, that is rather too bad! It is not in my line of duty. Come,
come, Rosine! bear your own burden. Be brave--charge once more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I, Mademoiselle?--impossible! Five times I have crossed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mademoiselle</b></font>) this day.
Madame must really hire a gendarme for this service. Ouf! Je n'en puis
plus!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! you are only a coward. What is the message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely of the kind with which Monsieur least likes to be pestered:
an urgent summons to go directly to the Athénée, as there is an
official visitor--inspector--I know not what--arrived, and Monsieur
_must_ meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>): you know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) hates a _must_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, I knew well enough. The restive little man detested spur or curb:
against whatever was urgent or obligatory, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sure to revolt.
However, I accepted the responsibility--not, certainly, without fear,
but fear blent with other sentiments, curiosity, amongst them. I opened
the door, I entered, I closed it behind me as quickly and quietly as a
rather unsteady hand would permit; for to be slow or bustling, to
rattle a latch, or leave a door gaping wide, were aggravations of crime
often more disastrous in result than the main crime itself. There I
stood then, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) humour was visibly bad--almost at its
worst; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been giving a lesson in arithmetic--for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave lessons
on any and every subject that struck his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancy--and arithmetic being a
dry subject, invariably disagreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): not a pupil but trembled
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke of figures. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat, bent above his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desk: to look up at
the sound of an entrance, at the occurrence of a direct breach of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
will and law, was an effort he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not for the moment bring himself
to make. It was quite as well: I thus gained time to walk up the long
classe; and it suited my idiosyncracy far better to encounter the near
burst of anger like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), than to bear its menace at a distance.

<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) estrade I paused, just in front; of course I was not worthy of
immediate attention: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proceeded with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lesson. Disdain would not
do: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must hear and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must answer my message.

<p/>Not being quite tall enough to lift my head over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desk, elevated
upon the estrade, and thus suffering eclipse in my present position, I
ventured to peep round, with the design, at first, of merely getting a
better view of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, which had struck me when I entered as bearing
a close and picturesque resemblance to that of a black and sallow
tiger. Twice did I enjoy this side-view with impunity, advancing and
receding unseen; the third time my eye had scarce dawned beyond the
obscuration of the desk, when it was caught and transfixed through its
very pupil--transfixed by the <div class="bookquote">``lunettes.''  (<font color='red'><b>pupil</b></font>)</div>Rosine was right; these
utensils had in them a blank and immutable terror, beyond the mobile
wrath of the wearer's own unglazed eyes.

<p/>I now found the advantage of proximity: these short-sighted <div class="bookquote">``lunettes''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>were useless for the inspection of a criminal under Monsieur's nose;
accordingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) doffed them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) and I stood on more equal terms.

<p/>I am glad I was not really much afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>)--that, indeed, close in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) presence, I felt no terror at all; for upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) demanding cord and
gibbet to execute the sentence recently pronounced, I was able to
furnish him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) with a needleful of embroidering thread with such
accommodating civility as could not but allay some portion at least of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) surplus irritation. Of course I did not parade this courtesy before
public view: I merely handed the thread round the angle of the desk,
and attached it, ready noosed, to the barred back of the Professor's
chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Que me voulez-vous?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) in a growl of which the music was wholly
confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) chest and throat, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) teeth clenched; and
seemed registering to himself an inward vow that nothing earthly should
wring from him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) a smile.

<p/>My answer commenced uncompromisingly: <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``je veux
l'impossible, des choses inouïes;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and thinking it best not to mince
matters, but to administer the <div class="bookquote">``douche''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>with decision, in a low but
quick voice, I delivered the Athenian message, floridly exaggerating
its urgency.

<p/>Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) would not hear a word of it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would not go; he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would
not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) present class, let all the officials of Villette send for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would not put himself an inch out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) way at the bidding of
king, cabinet, and chambers together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I knew, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) _must_ go; that, talk as he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) would, both his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
duty and interest commanded an immediate and literal compliance with
the summons: I stood, therefore, waiting in silence, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had not
yet spoken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) asked what more I wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only Monsieur's answer to deliver to the commissionaire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) waved an impatient negative.

<p/>I ventured to stretch my hand to the bonnet-grec which lay in grim
repose on the window-sill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) followed this daring movement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
eye, no doubt in mixed pity and amazement at its presumption.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) muttered, <div class="bookquote">``if it came to that--if Miss Lucy meddled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>)
bonnet-grec--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might just put it on herself, turn garçon for the
occasion, and benevolently go to the Athénée in his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) stead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With great respect, I laid the bonnet on the desk, where its tassel
seemed to give me an awful nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll write a note of apology--that will do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), still bent on
evasion.

<p/>Knowing well it would _not_ do, I gently pushed the bonnet towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
hand. Thus impelled, it slid down the polished slope of the varnished
and unbaized desk, carried before it the light steel-framed <div class="bookquote">``lunettes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and, fearful to relate, they fell to the estrade. A score of times ere
now had I seen them fall and receive no damage--_this_ time, as Lucy
Snowe's hapless luck would have it, they so fell that each clear pebble
became a shivered and shapeless star.

<p/>Now, indeed, dismay seized me--dismay and regret. I knew the value of
these <div class="bookquote">``lunettes'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>: M. Paul's sight was peculiar, not easily fitted, and
these glasses suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). I had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) call them his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) treasures: as I
picked them up, cracked and worthless, my hand trembled. Frightened
through all my nerves I was to see the mischief I had done, but I think
I was even more sorry than afraid. For some seconds I dared not look
the bereaved Professor in the face; he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was the first to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Là!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``me voilà veuf de mes lunettes! I think Mademoiselle
Lucy will now confess that the cord and gallows are amply earned; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
trembles in anticipation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) doom. Ah, traitress! traitress! You are
resolved to have me quite blind and helpless in your hands!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I lifted my eyes: his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) face, instead of being irate, lowering, and
furrowed, was overflowing with the smile, coloured with the bloom I had
seen brightening it that evening at the Hotel Crécy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was not
angry--not even grieved. For the real injury he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) showed himself full of
clemency; under the real provocation, patient as a saint. This event,
which seemed so untoward--which I thought had ruined at once my chance
of successful persuasion--proved my best help. Difficult of management
so long as I had done him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) no harm, he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) became graciously pliant as soon
as I stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) presence a conscious and contrite offender.

<p/>Still gently railing at me as <div class="bookquote">``une forte femme--une Anglaise
terrible--une petite casse-tout'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) dared not but
obey one who had given such an instance of her (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) dangerous prowess; it
was absolutely like the <div class="bookquote">``grand Empereur smashing the vase to inspire
dismay.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, at last, crowning himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) bonnet-grec, and taking
his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) ruined <div class="bookquote">``lunettes''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from my hand with a clasp of kind pardon and
encouragement, he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) bow, and went off to the Athénée in
first-rate humour and spirits.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>After all this amiability, the reader will be sorry for my sake to hear
that I was quarrelling with M. Paul again before night; yet so it was,
and I could not help it.

<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) occasional custom--and a very laudable, acceptable custom,
too--to arrive of an evening, always à l'improviste, unannounced, burst
in on the silent hour of study, establish a sudden despotism over us
and our occupations, cause books to be put away, work-bags to be
brought out, and, drawing forth a single thick volume, or a handful of
pamphlets, substitute for the besotted <div class="bookquote">``lecture pieuse,''  (<font color='red'><b>a handful</b></font>)</div>drawled by a
sleepy pupil, some tragedy made grand by grand reading, ardent by fiery
action--some drama, whereof, for my part, I rarely studied the
intrinsic merit; for M. Emanuel made it a vessel for an outpouring, and
filled it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) native verve and passion like a cup with a vital
brewage. Or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would flash through our conventual darkness a
reflex of a brighter world, show us a glimpse of the current literature
of the day, read us passages from some enchanting tale, or the last
witty feuilleton which had awakened laughter in the saloons of Paris;
taking care always to expunge, with the severest hand, whether from
tragedy, melodrama, tale, or essay, whatever passage, phrase, or word,
could be deemed unsuited to an audience of <div class="bookquote">``jeunes filles.''  (<font color='red'><b>an audience</b></font>)</div>I noticed
more than once, that where retrenchment without substitute would have
left unmeaning vacancy, or introduced weakness, he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) could, and did,
improvise whole paragraphs, no less vigorous than irreproachable; the
dialogue--the description--he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) engrafted was often far better than that
he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) pruned away.

<p/>Well, on the evening in question, we were sitting silent as nuns in a
<div class="bookquote">``retreat,''  (<font color='red'><b>nuns</b></font>)</div>the pupils studying, the teachers working. I remember my
work; it was a slight matter of fancy, and it rather interested me; it
had a purpose; I was not doing it merely to kill time; I meant it when
finished as a gift; and the occasion of presentation being near, haste
was requisite, and my fingers were busy.

<p/>We heard the sharp bell-peal which we all knew; then the rapid step
familiar to each ear: the words <div class="bookquote">``Voilà Monsieur!''  (<font color='red'><b>every lip</b></font>)</div>had scarcely broken
simultaneously from every lip, when the two-leaved door split -LRB-as split
it always did for his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) admission--such a slow word as <div class="bookquote">``open''  (<font color='red'><b>every lip</b></font>)</div>is
inefficient to describe his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) movements-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) stood in the midst of us.

<p/>There were two study tables, both long and flanked with benches; over
the centre of each hung a lamp; beneath this lamp, on either side the
table, sat a teacher; the girls were arranged to the right hand and the
left; the eldest and most studious nearest the lamps or tropics; the
idlers and little ones towards the north and south poles. Monsieur's
habit was politely to hand a chair to some teacher, generally Zélie St.
Pierre, the senior mistress; then to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) vacated seat; and thus
avail himself of the full beam of Cancer or Capricorn, which, owing to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) near sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) needed.

<p/>As usual, Zélie rose with alacrity, smiling to the whole extent of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
mouth, and the full display of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) upper and under rows of teeth--that
strange smile which passes from ear to ear, and is marked only by a
sharp thin curve, which fails to spread over the countenance, and
neither dimples the cheek nor lights the eye. I suppose Monsieur did
not see her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), or he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) had taken a whim that he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would not notice her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) was as capricious as women are said to be; then his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``lunettes''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>)
had got another pair-RRB- served him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) as an excuse for all sorts of little
oversights and shortcomings. Whatever might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) passed by
Zélie, came to the other side of the table, and before I could start up
to clear the way, whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Ne bougez pas,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and established himself
between me and Miss Fanshawe, who always would be my neighbour, and
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) elbow in my side, however often I declared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Ginevra, I
wish you were at Jericho.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It was easy to say, <div class="bookquote">``Ne bougez pas;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but how could I help it? I must
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) room, and I must request the pupils to recede that _I_ might
recede. It was very well for Ginevra to be gummed to me, <div class="bookquote">``keeping
herself warm,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) said, on the winter evenings, and harassing my
very heart with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) fidgetings and pokings, obliging me, indeed,
sometimes to put an artful pin in my girdle by way of protection
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) elbow; but I suppose M. Emanuel was not to be subjected to
the same kind of treatment, so I swept away my working materials, to
clear space for his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) book, and withdrew myself to make room for his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
person; not, however, leaving more than a yard of interval, just what
any reasonable man would have regarded as a convenient, respectful
allowance of bench. But M. Emanuel never _was_ reasonable; flint and
tinder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was! he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) struck and took fire directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vous ne voulez pas de moi pour voisin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) growled: <div class="bookquote">``vous vous donnez
des airs de caste; vous me traitez en paria;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) scowled. <div class="bookquote">``Soit! je
vais arranger la chose!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) set to work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Levez vous toutes, Mesdemoiselles!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>).

<p/>The girls rose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) made them all file off to the other table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) then
placed me at one extremity of the long bench, and having duly and
carefully brought me my work-basket, silk, scissors, all my implements,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) fixed himself quite at the other end.

<p/>At this arrangement, highly absurd as it was, not a soul in the room
dared to laugh; luckless for the giggler would have been the giggle. As
for me, I took it with entire coolness. There I sat, isolated and cut
off from human intercourse; I sat and minded my work, and was quiet,
and not at all unhappy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Est ce assez de distance?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur en est l'arbitre,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vous savez bien que non. C'est vous qui avez crée ce vide immense: moi
je n'y ai pas mis la main.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>And with this assertion he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) commenced the reading.

<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) misfortune he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had chosen a French translation of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) called
<div class="bookquote">``un drame de Williams Shackspire; le faux dieu,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) further announced,
<div class="bookquote">``de ces sots païens, les Anglais.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>How far otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would have
characterized him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) temper not been upset, I scarcely need
intimate.

<p/>Of course, the translation being French, was very inefficient; nor did
I make any particular effort to conceal the contempt which some of its
forlorn lapses were calculated to excite. Not that it behoved or
beseemed me to say anything: but one can occasionally _look_ the
opinion it is forbidden to embody in words. Monsieur's lunettes being
on the alert, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) gleaned up every stray look; I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) lost
one: the consequence was, his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) eyes soon discarded a screen, that their
blaze might sparkle free, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) waxed hotter at the north pole to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) had voluntarily exiled himself, than, considering the general
temperature of the room, it would have been reasonable to become under
the vertical ray of Cancer itself.

<p/>The reading over, it appeared problematic whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would depart with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) anger unexpressed, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would give it vent. Suppression
was not much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) habits; but still, what had been done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>)
definite enough to afford matter for overt reproof? I had not uttered a
sound, and could not justly be deemed amenable to reprimand or penalty
for having permitted a slightly freer action than usual to the muscles
about my eyes and mouth.

<p/>The supper, consisting of bread, and milk diluted with tepid water, was
brought in. In respectful consideration of the Professor's presence,
the rolls and glasses were allowed to stand instead of being
immediately handed round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take your supper, ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), seeming to be occupied in making
marginal notes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Williams Shackspire.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They took it. I also
accepted a roll and glass, but being now more than ever interested in
my work, I kept my seat of punishment, and wrought while I munched my
bread and sipped my beverage, the whole with easy _sang-froid_; with a
certain snugness of composure, indeed, scarcely in my habits, and
pleasantly novel to my feelings. It seemed as if the presence of a
nature so restless, chafing, thorny as that of M. Paul absorbed all
feverish and unsettling influences like a magnet, and left me none but
such as were placid and harmonious.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rose. <div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) go away without saying another word?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned
to the door.

<p/>No: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) _re_-turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) steps; but only, perhaps, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
pencil-case, which had been left on the table.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took it--shut the pencil in and out, broke its point against the
wood, re-cut and pocketed it, and ... walked promptly up to me.

<p/>The girls and teachers, gathered round the other table, were talking
pretty freely: they always talked at meals; and, from the constant
habit of speaking fast and loud at such times, did not now subdue their
voices much.

<p/>M. Paul came and stood behind me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked at what I was working; and I
said I was making a watchguard.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``For whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And I answered, <div class="bookquote">``For a gentleman--one of my
friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Paul stooped down and proceeded--as novel-writers say, and, as was
literally true in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) case--to <div class="bookquote">``hiss''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>into my ear some poignant words.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said that, of all the women he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew, I was the one who could make
herself the most consummately unpleasant: I was she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with whom it was
least possible to live on friendly terms. I had a <div class="bookquote">``caractère
intraitable,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and perverse to a miracle. How I managed it, or what
possessed me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) part, did not know; but with whatever pacific
and amicable intentions a person accosted me--crac! I turned concord to
discord, good-will to enmity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)--M. Paul--wished me well
enough; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had never done me any harm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew of; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) might, at
least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) supposed, claim a right to be regarded as a neutral
acquaintance, guiltless of hostile sentiments: yet, how I behaved to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)! With what pungent vivacities--what an impetus of mutiny--what a
<div class="bookquote">``fougue''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of injustice!

<p/>Here I could not avoid opening my eyes somewhat wide, and even slipping
in a slight interjectional observation: <div class="bookquote">``Vivacities? Impetus? Fougue? I
didn't know...''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chut! à l'instant! There! there I went--vive comme la poudre!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
sorry--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was very sorry: for my sake he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) grieved over the hapless
peculiarity. This <div class="bookquote">``emportement,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>this <div class="bookquote">``chaleur'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--generous, perhaps, but
excessive--would yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feared, do me a mischief. It was a pity: I was
not--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) believed, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) soul--wholly without good qualities: and would
I but hear reason, and be more sedate, more sober, less <div class="bookquote">``en l'air,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>less <div class="bookquote">``coquette,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>less taken by show, less prone to set an undue value
on outside excellence--to make much of the attentions of people
remarkable chiefly for so many feet of stature, <div class="bookquote">``des couleurs de
poupée,''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``un nez plus ou moins bien fait,''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>and an enormous amount of
fatuity--I might yet prove an useful, perhaps an exemplary character.
But, as it was--And here, the little man's voice was for a minute
choked.

<p/>I would have looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or held out my hand, or said a soothing
word; but I was afraid, if I stirred, I should either laugh or cry; so
odd, in all this, was the mixture of the touching and the absurd.

<p/>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nearly done: but no; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might go on
at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``While he (<font color='blue'><b>nez</b></font>), M. Paul, was on these painful topics, he (<font color='blue'><b>nez</b></font>) would dare my anger
for the sake of my good, and would venture to refer to a change he (<font color='blue'><b>nez</b></font>) had
noticed in my dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>nez</b></font>) was free to confess that when he (<font color='blue'><b>nez</b></font>) first knew
me--or, rather, was in the habit of catching a passing glimpse of me
from time to time--I satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>nez</b></font>) on this point: the gravity, the
austere simplicity, obvious in this particular, were such as to inspire
the highest hopes for my best interests. What fatal influence had
impelled me lately to introduce flowers under the brim of my bonnet, to
wear `des cols brodés,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and even to appear on one occasion in a
_scarlet gown_--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might indeed conjecture, but, for the present, would
not openly declare.''

<p/>Again I interrupted, and this time not without an accent at once
indignant and horror-struck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scarlet, Monsieur Paul? It was not scarlet! It was pink, and pale pink
to: and further subdued by black lace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pink or scarlet, yellow or crimson, pea-green or sky-blue, it was all
one: these were all flaunting, giddy colours; and as to the lace I
talked of, _that_ was but a `colifichet de plus.'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sighed over
my degeneracy. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was sorry to say, be so particular on
this theme as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could wish: not possessing the exact names of these
``babioles,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might run into small verbal errors which would not fail
to lay him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) open to my sarcasm, and excite my unhappily sudden and
passionate disposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would merely say, in general terms--and in
these general terms he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was correct--that my costume had of late
assumed `des façons mondaines,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which it wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to see.''

<p/>What <div class="bookquote">``façons mondaines''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discovered in my present winter merino and
plain white collar, I own it puzzled me to guess: and when I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said it was all made with too much attention to effect--and besides,
<div class="bookquote">``had I not a bow of ribbon at my neck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you condemn a bow of ribbon for a lady, Monsieur, you would
necessarily disapprove of a thing like this for a gentleman?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--holding
up my bright little chainlet of silk and gold. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sole reply was a
groan--I suppose over my levity.

<p/>After sitting some minutes in silence, and watching the progress of the
chain, at which I now wrought more assiduously than ever, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquired:
<div class="bookquote">``Whether what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had just said would have the effect of making me
entirely detest him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I hardly remember what answer I made, or how it came about; I don't
think I spoke at all, but I know we managed to bid good-night on
friendly terms: and, even after M. Paul had reached the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) turned
back just to explain, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would not be understood to speak in
entire condemnation of the scarlet dress''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Pink! pink!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I threw in-RRB-;
<div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no intention to deny it the merit of _looking_ rather
well''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the fact was, M. Emanuel's taste in colours decidedly leaned to
the brilliant-RRB-; ``only he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wished to counsel me, whenever, I wore it, to
do so in the same spirit as if its material were ``bure,<div class="bookquote">'' and its hue
`gris de poussière.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the flowers under my bonnet, Monsieur?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``They are very
little ones--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep them little, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Permit them not to become
full-blown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the bow, Monsieur--the bit of ribbon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Va pour le ruban!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the propitious answer.

<p/>And so we settled it.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, Lucy Snowe!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I to myself; <div class="bookquote">``you have come in for a
pretty lecture--brought on yourself a `rude savant,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and all through
your wicked fondness for worldly vanities! Who would have thought it?
You deemed yourself a melancholy sober-sides enough! Miss Fanshawe
there regards you as a second Diogenes. M. de Bassompierre, the other
day, politely turned the conversation when it ran on the wild gifts of
the actress Vashti, because, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) kindly said, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe looked
uncomfortable.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dr. John Bretton knows you only as `quiet Lucy'--'a

manner--want of colour in character and costume.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Such are your own and
your friends' impressions; and behold! there starts up a little man,
differing diametrically from all these, roundly charging you with being
too airy and cheery--too volatile and versatile--too flowery and
coloury. This harsh little man--this pitiless censor--gathers up all
your poor scattered sins of vanity, your luckless chiffon of
rose-colour, your small fringe of a wreath, your small scrap of ribbon,
your silly bit of lace, and calls you to account for the lot, and for
each item. You are well habituated to be passed by as a shadow in
Life's sunshine: it is a new thing to see one testily lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand
to screen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, because you tease him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with an obtrusive ray.''




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX.

<p/>MONSIEUR``S FÊTE.


<p/>I was up the next morning an hour before daybreak, and finished my
guard, kneeling on the dormitory floor beside the centre stand, for the
benefit of such expiring glimmer as the night-lamp afforded in its last
watch.

<p/>All my materials--my whole stock of beads and silk--were used up before
the chain assumed the length and richness I wished; I had wrought it
double, as I knew, by the rule of contraries, that to, suit the
particular taste whose gratification was in view, an effective
appearance was quite indispensable. As a finish to the ornament, a
little gold clasp was needed; fortunately I possessed it in the
fastening of my sole necklace; I duly detached and re-attached it, then
coiled compactly the completed guard; and enclosed it in a small box I
had bought for its brilliancy, made of some tropic shell of the colour
called <div class="bookquote">``nacarat,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and decked with a little coronal of sparkling blue
stones. Within the lid of the box, I carefully graved with my scissors'
point certain initials.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>The reader will, perhaps, remember the description of Madame Beck's
fête; nor will he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) have forgotten that at each anniversary, a handsome
present was subscribed for and offered by the school. The observance of
this day was a distinction accorded to none but Madame, and, in a
modified form, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) kinsman and counsellor, M. Emanuel. In the latter
case it was an honour spontaneously awarded, not plotted and contrived
beforehand, and offered an additional proof, amongst many others, of
the estimation in which--despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) partialities, prejudices, and
irritabilities--the professor of literature was held by his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) pupils. No
article of value was offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) distinctly gave it to be
understood, that he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) would accept neither plate nor jewellery. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>)
liked a slight tribute; the cost, the money-value, did not touch him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>): a
diamond ring, a gold snuff-box, presented, with pomp, would have
pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) less than a flower, or a drawing, offered simply and with
sincere feelings. Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) was a man, not wise in his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>)
generation, yet could he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) claim a filial sympathy with <div class="bookquote">``the dayspring on
high.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Paul's fête fell on the first of March and a Thursday. It proved a
fine sunny day; and being likewise the morning on which it was
customary to attend mass; being also otherwise distinguished by the
half-holiday which permitted the privilege of walking out, shopping, or
paying visits in the afternoon: these combined considerations induced a
general smartness and freshness of dress. Clean collars were in vogue;
the ordinary dingy woollen classe-dress was exchanged for something
lighter and clearer. Mademoiselle Zélie St. Pierre, on this particular
Thursday, even assumed a <div class="bookquote">``robe de soie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Zélie St. Pierre</b></font>)</div>deemed in economical
Labassecour an article of hazardous splendour and luxury; nay, it was
remarked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) sent for a <div class="bookquote">``coiffeur''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) hair that morning;
there were pupils acute enough to discover that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) had bedewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>)
handkerchief and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) hands with a new and fashionable perfume. Poor
Zélie! It was much her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) wont to declare about this time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) was
tired to death of a life of seclusion and labour; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) longed to
have the means and leisure for relaxation; to have some one to work for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>)--a husband who would pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) debts -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) was woefully encumbered
with debt-RRB-, supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) wardrobe, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) at liberty, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) said,
to <div class="bookquote">``goûter un peu les plaisirs.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It had long been rumoured, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>)
eye was upon M. Emanuel. Monsieur Emanuel's eye was certainly often
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would sit and watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) perseveringly for minutes
together. I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) give her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) a quarter-of-an-hour's gaze, while
the class was silently composing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) sat throned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) estrade,
unoccupied. Conscious always of this basilisk attention, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) would
writhe under it, half-flattered, half-puzzled, and Monsieur would
follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) sensations, sometimes looking appallingly acute; for in some
cases, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) had the terrible unerring penetration of instinct, and
pierced in its hiding-place the last lurking thought of the heart, and
discerned under florid veilings the bare; barren places of the spirit:
yes, and its perverted tendencies, and its hidden false curves--all
that men and women would not have known--the twisted spine, the
malformed limb that was born with them, and far worse, the stain or
disfigurement they have perhaps brought on themselves. No calamity so
accursed but M. Emanuel could pity and forgive, if it were acknowledged
candidly; but where his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) questioning eyes met dishonest denial--where
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) ruthless researches found deceitful concealment--oh, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) could
be cruel, and I thought wicked! he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would exultantly snatch the screen
from poor shrinking wretches, passionately hurry them to the summit of
the mount of exposure, and there show them all naked, all false--poor
living lies--the spawn of that horrid Truth which cannot be looked on
unveiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) did justice; for my part I doubt whether man
has a right to do such justice on man: more than once in these his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
visitations, I have felt compelled to give tears to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) victims, and
not spared ire and keen reproach to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deserved it; but it was
difficult to shake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) firm conviction that the work was
righteous and needed.

<p/>Breakfast being over and mass attended, the school-bell rang and the
rooms filled: a very pretty spectacle was presented in classe. Pupils
and teachers sat neatly arrayed, orderly and expectant, each bearing in
her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand the bouquet of felicitation--the prettiest spring-flowers all
fresh, and filling the air with their fragrance: I only had no bouquet.
I like to see flowers growing, but when they are gathered, they cease
to please. I look on them as things rootless and perishable; their
likeness to life makes me sad. I never offer flowers to those I love; I
never wish to receive them from hands dear to me. Mademoiselle St.
Pierre marked my empty hands--she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not believe I had been so
remiss; with avidity her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye roved over and round me: surely I must
have some solitary symbolic flower somewhere: some small knot of
violets, something to win myself praise for taste, commendation for
ingenuity. The unimaginative <div class="bookquote">``Anglaise''  (<font color='red'><b>the Parisienne</b></font>)</div>proved better than the
Parisienne's fears: she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat literally unprovided, as bare of bloom or
leaf as the winter tree. This ascertained, Zélie smiled, well pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How wisely you have acted to keep your money, Miss Lucie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said:
<div class="bookquote">``silly I have gone and thrown away two francs on a bouquet of hot-house
flowers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) showed with pride her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) splendid nosegay.

<p/>But hush! a step: _the_ step. It came prompt, as usual, but with a
promptitude, we felt disposed to flatter ourselves, inspired by other
feelings than mere excitability of nerve and vehemence of intent. We
thought our Professor's <div class="bookquote">``foot-fall''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>-LRB-to speak romantically-RRB- had in it a
friendly promise this morning; and so it had.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) entered in a mood which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) as good as a new sunbeam to the
already well-lit first classe. The morning light playing amongst our
plants and laughing on our walls, caught an added lustre from M. Paul's
all-benignant salute. Like a true Frenchman -LRB-though I don't know why I
should say so, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) was of strain neither French nor Labassecourien-RRB-,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) had dressed for the <div class="bookquote">``situation''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the occasion. Not by the vague
folds, sinister and conspirator-like, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) soot-dark paletôt were the
outlines of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) person obscured; on the contrary, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) figure -LRB-such as
it was, I don't boast of it-RRB- was well set off by a civilized coat and a
silken vest quite pretty to behold. The defiant and pagan bonnet-grec
had vanished: bare-headed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) came upon us, carrying a Christian hat in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) gloved hand. The little man looked well, very well; there was a
clearness of amity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) blue eye, and a glow of good feeling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>)
dark complexion, which passed perfectly in the place of beauty: one
really did not care to observe that his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) nose, though far from small,
was of no particular shape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) cheek thin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) brow marked and square,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) mouth no rose-bud: one accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) was, and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>)
presence the reverse of damping or insignificant.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) passed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) desk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) placed on the same his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) hat and gloves. <div class="bookquote">``Bon
jour, mes amies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>), in a tone that somehow made amends to some
amongst us for many a sharp snap and savage snarl: not a jocund,
good-fellow tone, still less an unctuous priestly, accent, but a voice
he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) had belonging to himself--a voice used when his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) heart passed the
words to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) lips. That same heart did speak sometimes; though an
irritable, it was not an ossified organ: in its core was a place,
tender beyond a man's tenderness; a place that humbled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to little
children, that bound him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to girls and women to whom, rebel as he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) would,
he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) could not disown his (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) affinity, nor quite deny that, on the whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>)
was better with them than with his (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) own sex.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We all wish Monsieur a good day, and present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) our
congratulations on the anniversary of his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) fête,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Zélie</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle
Zélie, constituting herself spokeswoman of the assembly; and advancing
with no more twists of affectation than were with her (<font color='blue'><b>spokeswoman</b></font>) indispensable to
the achievement of motion, she (<font color='blue'><b>spokeswoman</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>spokeswoman</b></font>) costly bouquet before him (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>)
bowed over it.

<p/>The long train of offerings followed: all the pupils, sweeping past
with the gliding step foreigners practise, left their tributes as they
went by. Each girl so dexterously adjusted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) separate gift, that when
the last bouquet was laid on the desk, it formed the apex to a blooming
pyramid--a pyramid blooming, spreading, and towering with such
exuberance as, in the end, to eclipse the hero behind it. This ceremony
over, seats were resumed, and we sat in dead silence, expectant of a
speech.

<p/>I suppose five minutes might have elapsed, and the hush remained
unbroken; ten--and there was no sound.

<p/>Many present began, doubtless, to wonder for what Monsieur waited; as
well they might. Voiceless and viewless, stirless and wordless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) kept
his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) station behind the pile of flowers.

<p/>At last there issued forth a voice, rather deep, as if it spoke out of
a hollow:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Est-ce là tout?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Zélie</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle Zélie looked round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have all presented your bouquets?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>inquired she (<font color='blue'><b>Zélie</b></font>) of the pupils.

<p/>Yes; they had all given their nosegays, from the eldest to the
youngest, from the tallest to the most diminutive. The senior mistress
signified as much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Est-ce là tout?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was reiterated in an intonation which, deep before,
had now descended some notes lower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle/Pierre/Mademoiselle St. Pierre</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle St. Pierre, rising, and this time
speaking with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) own sweet smile, <div class="bookquote">``I have the honour to tell you that,
with a single exception, every person in classe has offered her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)
bouquet. For Meess Lucie, Monsieur will kindly make allowance; as a
foreigner she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) probably did not know our customs, or did not appreciate
their significance. Meess Lucie has regarded this ceremony as too
frivolous to be honoured by her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) observance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle/Pierre/Mademoiselle St. Pierre</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Famous!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered between my teeth: <div class="bookquote">``you are no bad speaker, Zélie,
when you begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The answer vouchsafed to Mademoiselle St Pierre from the estrade was
given in the gesticulation of a hand from behind the pyramid. This
manual action seemed to deprecate words, to enjoin silence.

<p/>A form, ere long, followed the hand. Monsieur emerged from his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) eclipse;
and producing himself on the front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) estrade, and gazing straight
and fixedly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) at a vast <div class="bookquote">``mappe-monde''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>covering the wall
opposite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) demanded a third time, and now in really tragic tones--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Est-ce là tout?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I might yet have made all right, by stepping forwards and slipping into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) hand the ruddy little shell-box I at that moment held tight in my
own. It was what I had fully purposed to do; but, first, the comic side
of Monsieur's behaviour had tempted me to delay, and now, Mademoiselle
St. Pierre's affected interference provoked contumacity. The reader not
having hitherto had any cause to ascribe to Miss Snowe's character the
most distant pretensions to perfection, will be scarcely surprised to
learn that she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) felt too perverse to defend herself from any imputation
the Parisienne might choose to insinuate and besides, M. Paul was so
tragic, and took my defection so seriously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) deserved to be vexed. I
kept, then, both my box and my countenance, and sat insensate as any
stone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>dropped at length from the lips of M. Paul; and having
uttered this phrase, the shadow of some great paroxysm--the swell of
wrath, scorn, resolve--passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brow, rippled his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips, and
lined his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cheeks. Gulping down all further comment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) launched into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) customary <div class="bookquote">``discours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I can't at all remember what this <div class="bookquote">``discours''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was; I did not listen to
it: the gulping-down process, the abrupt dismissal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mortification
or vexation, had given me a sensation which half-counteracted the
ludicrous effect of the reiterated <div class="bookquote">``Est-ce là tout?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Towards the close of the speech there came a pleasing diversion my
attention was again amusingly arrested.

<p/>Owing to some little accidental movement--I think I dropped my thimble
on the floor, and in stooping to regain it, hit the crown of my head
against the sharp corner of my desk; which casualties -LRB-exasperating to
me, by rights, if to anybody-RRB- naturally made a slight bustle--M. Paul
became irritated, and dismissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) forced equanimity, and casting to
the winds that dignity and self-control with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) never cared long
to encumber himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) broke forth into the strain best calculated to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ease.

<p/>I don't know how, in the progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``discours,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had contrived
to cross the Channel and land on British ground; but there I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
when I began to listen.

<p/>Casting a quick, cynical glance round the room--a glance which scathed,
or was intended to scathe, as it crossed me--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fell with fury upon
<div class="bookquote">``les Anglaises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Never have I heard English women handled as M. Paul that morning
handled them: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spared nothing--neither their minds, morals, manners,
nor personal appearance. I specially remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) abuse of their tall
stature, their long necks, their thin arms, their slovenly dress, their
pedantic education, their impious scepticism-LRB-!-RRB-, their insufferable
pride, their pretentious virtue: over which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ground his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) teeth
malignantly, and looked as if, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dared, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have said
singular things. Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was spiteful, acrid, savage; and, as a natural
consequence, detestably ugly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Little wicked venomous man!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I; <div class="bookquote">``am I going to harass myself
with fears of displeasing you, or hurting your feelings? No, indeed;
you shall be indifferent to me, as the shabbiest bouquet in your
pyramid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I grieve to say I could not quite carry out this resolution. For some
time the abuse of England and the English found and left me stolid: I
bore it some fifteen minutes stoically enough; but this hissing
cockatrice was determined to sting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said such things at
last--fastening not only upon our women, but upon our greatest names
and best men; sullying, the shield of Britannia, and dabbling the union
jack in mud--that I was stung. With vicious relish he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brought up the
most spicy current continental historical falsehoods--than which
nothing can be conceived more offensive. Zélie, and the whole class,
became one grin of vindictive delight; for it is curious to discover
how these clowns of Labassecour secretly hate England. At last, I
struck a sharp stroke on my desk, opened my lips, and let loose this
cry:--

<p/>``Vive l``Angleterre, l<div class="bookquote">``Histoire et les Héros! A bas la France, la
Fiction et les Faquins!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The class was struck of a heap. I suppose they thought me mad. The
Professor put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) handkerchief, and fiendishly smiled into its
folds. Little monster of malice! He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) now thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had got the victory,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had made me angry. In a second he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) became good-humoured. With
great blandness he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) resumed the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) flowers; talked
poetically and symbolically of their sweetness, perfume, purity,
etcetera; made Frenchified comparisons between the <div class="bookquote">``jeunes filles''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
the sweet blossoms before him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>); paid Mademoiselle St. Pierre a very
full-blown compliment on the superiority of her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) bouquet; and ended by
announcing that the first really fine, mild, and balmy morning in
spring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) intended to take the whole class out to breakfast in the
country. <div class="bookquote">``Such of the class, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) added, with emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could count amongst the number of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Donc je n'y serai pas,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>declared I, involuntarily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Soit!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) response; and, gathering his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) flowers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>)
flashed out of classe; while I, consigning my work, scissors, thimble,
and the neglected little box, to my desk, swept up-stairs. I don't know
whether _he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>)_ felt hot and angry, but I am free to confess that _I_ did.

<p/>Yet with a strange evanescent anger, I had not sat an hour on the edge
of my bed, picturing and repicturing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) look, manner, words ere I
smiled at the whole scene. A little pang of regret I underwent that the
box had not been offered. I had meant to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>). Fate would not
have it so.

<p/>In the course of the afternoon, remembering that desks in classe were
by no means inviolate repositories, and thinking that it was as well to
secure the box, on account of the initials in the lid, P. C. D. E., for
Paul Carl -LRB-or Carlos-RRB- David Emanuel--such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) full name--these
foreigners must always have a string of baptismals--I descended to the
schoolroom.

<p/>It slept in holiday repose. The day pupils were all gone home, the
boarders were out walking, the teachers, except the surveillante of the
week, were in town, visiting or shopping; the suite of divisions was
vacant; so was the grande salle, with its huge solemn globe hanging in
the midst, its pair of many-branched chandeliers, and its horizontal
grand piano closed, silent, enjoying its mid-week Sabbath. I rather
wondered to find the first classe door ajar; this room being usually
locked when empty, and being then inaccessible to any save Madame Beck
and myself, who possessed a duplicate key. I wondered still more, on
approaching, to hear a vague movement as of life--a step, a chair
stirred, a sound like the opening of a desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only Madame Beck doing inspection duty,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the conclusion
following a moment's reflection. The partially-opened door gave
opportunity for assurance on this point. I looked. Behold! not the
inspecting garb of Madame Beck--the shawl and the clean cap--but the
coat, and the close-shorn, dark head of a man. This person occupied my
chair; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) olive hand held my desk open, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose was lost to view
amongst my papers. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back was towards me, but there could not be a
moment's question about identity. Already was the attire of ceremony
discarded: the cherished and ink-stained paletôt was resumed; the
perverse bonnet-grec lay on the floor, as if just dropped from the
hand, culpably busy.

<p/>Now I knew, and I had long known, that that hand of M. Emanuel's was on
the most intimate terms with my desk; that it raised and lowered the
lid, ransacked and arranged the contents, almost as familiarly as my
own. The fact was not dubious, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) wish it to be so: he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) left
signs of each visit palpable and unmistakable; hitherto, however, I had
never caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) in the act: watch as I would, I could not detect the
hours and moments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) coming. I saw the brownie's work in exercises
left overnight full of faults, and found next morning carefully
corrected: I profited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) capricious good-will in loans full welcome
and refreshing. Between a sallow dictionary and worn-out grammar would
magically grow a fresh interesting new work, or a classic, mellow and
sweet in its ripe age. Out of my work-basket would laughingly peep a
romance, under it would lurk the pamphlet, the magazine, whence last
evening's reading had been extracted. Impossible to doubt the source
whence these treasures flowed: had there been no other indication, one
condemning and traitor peculiarity, common to them all, settled the
question--_they smelt of cigars_. This was very shocking, of course:
_I_ thought so at first, and used to open the window with some bustle,
to air my desk, and with fastidious finger and thumb, to hold the
peccant brochures forth to the purifying breeze. I was cured of that
formality suddenly. Monsieur caught me at it one day, understood the
inference, instantly relieved my hand of its burden, and, in another
moment, would have thrust the same into the glowing stove. It chanced
to be a book, on the perusal of which I was bent; so for once I proved
as decided and quicker than himself; recaptured the spoil, and--having
saved this volume--never hazarded a second. With all this, I had never
yet been able to arrest in his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) visits the freakish, friendly,
cigar-loving phantom.

<p/>But now at last I had him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>): there he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was--the very brownie himself; and
there, curling from his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lips, was the pale blue breath of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) Indian
darling: he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was smoking into my desk: it might well betray him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
Provoked at this particular, and yet pleased to surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)--pleased,
that is, with the mixed feeling of the housewife who discovers at last
her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) strange elfin ally busy in the dairy at the untimely churn--I
softly stole forward, stood behind him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), bent with precaution over his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
shoulder.

<p/>My heart smote me to see that--after this morning's hostility, after my
seeming remissness, after the puncture experienced by his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) feelings, and
the ruffling undergone by his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) temper--he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), all willing to forget and
forgive, had brought me a couple of handsome volumes, of which the
title and authorship were guarantees for interest. Now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sat
bending above the desk, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was stirring up its contents; but with
gentle and careful hand; disarranging indeed, but not harming. My heart
smote me: as I bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sat unconscious, doing me what good
he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could, and I daresay not feeling towards me unkindly, my morning's
anger quite melted: I did not dislike Professor Emanuel.

<p/>I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) heard me breathe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) turned suddenly: his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) temperament was
nervous, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) never started, and seldom changed colour: there was
something hardy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were gone into town with the other teachers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>),
taking a grim gripe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) self-possession, which half-escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``It
is as well you are not. Do you think I care for being caught? Not I. I
often visit your desk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You find a brochure or tome now and then; but you don't read them,
because they have passed under this?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) cigar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have, and are no better for the process; but I read them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without pleasure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur must not be contradicted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like them, or any of them?--are they acceptable?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur has
seen me reading them a hundred times, and knows I have not so many
recreations as to undervalue those he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) provides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean well; and, if you see that I mean well, and derive some little
amusement from my efforts, why can we not be friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fatalist would say--because we cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I awoke in a bright mood, and came into
classe happy; you spoiled my day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Monsieur, only an hour or two of it, and that unintentionally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unintentionally! No. It was my fête-day; everybody wished me happiness
but you. The little children of the third division gave each her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) knot
of violets, lisped each her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) congratulation:--you--nothing. Not a bud,
leaf, whisper--not a glance. Was this unintentional?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant no harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you really did not know our custom? You were unprepared? You
would willingly have laid out a few centimes on a flower to give me
pleasure, had you been aware that it was expected? Say so, and all is
forgotten, and the pain soothed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did know that it was expected: I _was_ prepared; yet I laid out no
centimes on flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It is well--you do right to be honest. I should almost have hated you
had you flattered and lied. Better declare at once ``Paul Carl
Emanuel--je te déteste, mon garçon!<div class="bookquote">''--than smile an interest, look an
affection, and be false and cold at heart. False and cold I don't think
you are; but you have made a great mistake in life, that I believe; I
think your judgment is warped--that you are indifferent where you ought
to be grateful--and perhaps devoted and infatuated, where you ought to
be cool as your name. Don't suppose that I wish you to have a passion
for me, Mademoiselle; Dieu vous en garde! What do you start for?
Because I said passion? Well, I say it again. There is such a word, and
there is such a thing--though not within these walls, thank heaven! You
are no child that one should not speak of what exists; but I only
uttered the word--the thing, I assure you, is alien to my whole life
and views. It died in the past--in the present it lies buried--its
grave is deep-dug, well-heaped, and many winters old: in the future
there will be a resurrection, as I believe to my souls consolation; but
all will then be changed--form and feeling: the mortal will have put on
immortality--it will rise, not for earth, but heaven. All I say to
_you_, Miss Lucy Snowe, is--that you ought to treat Professor Paul
Emanuel decently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul Carl Emanuel déteste</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not, and did not contradict such a sentiment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``when it is _your_ fête-day, and I will not
grudge a few centimes for a small offering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be like me, Monsieur: this cost more than a few centimes, and
I did not grudge its price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And taking from the open desk the little box, I put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It lay ready in my lap this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued; <div class="bookquote">``and if Monsieur
had been rather more patient, and Mademoiselle St. Pierre less
interfering--perhaps I should say, too, if _I_ had been calmer and
wiser--I should have given it then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) looked at the box: I saw its clear warm tint and bright azure
circlet, pleased his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) eyes. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) to open it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My initials!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), indicating the letters in the lid. <div class="bookquote">``Who told
you I was called Carl David?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little bird, Monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it fly from me to you? Then one can tie a message under its wing
when needful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) took out the chain--a trifle indeed as to value, but glossy with
silk and sparkling with beads. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) liked that too--admired it artlessly,
like a child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the thing you were working at last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You finished it this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You commenced it with the intention that it should be mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And offered on my fête-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This purpose continued as you wove it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Again I assented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is not necessary that I should cut out any portion--saying,
this part is not mine: it was plaited under the idea and for the
adornment of another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means. It is neither necessary, nor would it be just.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This object is _all_ mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That object is yours entirely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div><p/>Straightway Monsieur opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) paletôt, arranged the guard splendidly
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) chest, displaying as much and suppressing as little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
could: for he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had no notion of concealing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) admired and thought
decorative. As to the box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) pronounced it a superb bonbonnière--he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
was fond of bonbons, by the way--and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) always liked to share with
others what pleased himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would give his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``dragées''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as freely as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lent his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) books. Amongst the kind brownie's gifts left in my desk, I
forgot to enumerate many a paper of chocolate comfits. His (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) tastes in
these matters were southern, and what we think infantine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) simple
lunch consisted frequently of a <div class="bookquote">``brioche,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which, as often as not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
shared with some child of the third division.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A présent c'est un fait accompli,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), re-adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) paletôt;
and we had no more words on the subject. After looking over the two
volumes he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had brought, and cutting away some pages with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) penknife
-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) generally pruned before lending his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) books, especially if they were
novels, and sometimes I was a little provoked at the severity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
censorship, the retrenchments interrupting the narrative-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) rose,
politely touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) bonnet-grec, and bade me a civil good-day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are friends now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I, <div class="bookquote">``till the next time we quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>We _might_ have quarrelled again that very same evening, but, wonderful
to relate, failed, for once, to make the most of our opportunity.

<p/>Contrary to all expectation, M. Paul arrived at the study-hour. Having
seen so much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in the morning, we did not look for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) presence at
night. No sooner were we seated at lessons, however, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) appeared.
I own I was glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), so glad that I could not help greeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
arrival with a smile; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) way to the same seat about
which so serious a misunderstanding had formerly arisen, I took good
care not to make too much room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) watched with a jealous,
side-long look, to see whether I shrank away, but I did not, though the
bench was a little crowded. I was losing the early impulse to recoil
from M. Paul. Habituated to the paletôt and bonnet-grec, the
neighbourhood of these garments seemed no longer uncomfortable or very
formidable. I did not now sit restrained, <div class="bookquote">``asphyxiée''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) used to
say-RRB- at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) side; I stirred when I wished to stir, coughed when it was
necessary, even yawned when I was tired--did, in short, what I pleased,
blindly reliant upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) indulgence. Nor did my temerity, this evening
at least, meet the punishment it perhaps merited; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was both indulgent
and good-natured; not a cross glance shot from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes, not a hasty
word left his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips. Till the very close of the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not
indeed address me at all, yet I felt, somehow, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was full of
friendliness. Silence is of different kinds, and breathes different
meanings; no words could inspire a pleasanter content than did M.
Paul's worldless presence. When the tray came in, and the bustle of
supper commenced, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) just said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) retired, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wished me a good
night and sweet dreams; and a good night and sweet dreams I had.




<p/>CHAPTER XXX.

<p/>M. PAUL.


<p/>Yet the reader is advised not to be in any hurry with his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) kindly
conclusions, or to suppose, with an over-hasty charity, that from that
day M. Paul became a changed character--easy to live with, and no
longer apt to flash danger and discomfort round him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was naturally a little man of unreasonable moods. When
over-wrought, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) often was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) became acutely irritable; and,
besides, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) veins were dark with a livid belladonna tincture, the
essence of jealousy. I do not mean merely the tender jealousy of the
heart, but that sterner, narrower sentiment whose seat is in the head.

<p/>I used to think, as I Sat looking at M. Paul, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
brow or protruding his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lip over some exercise of mine, which had not as
many faults as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wished -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) liked me to commit faults: a knot of
blunders was sweet to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as a cluster of nuts-RRB-, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had points of
resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte. I think so still.

<p/>In a shameless disregard of magnanimity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaparte</b></font>) resembled the great
Emperor. M. Paul would have quarrelled with twenty learned women, would
have unblushingly carried on a system of petty bickering and
recrimination with a whole capital of coteries, never troubling himself
about loss or lack of dignity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have exiled fifty Madame de
Staëls, if, they had annoyed, offended, outrivalled, or opposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>I well remember a hot episode of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with a certain Madame Panache--a
lady temporarily employed by Madame Beck to give lessons in history.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was clever--that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew a good deal; and, besides, thoroughly
possessed the art of making the most of what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew; of words and
confidence she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held unlimited command. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) personal appearance was far
from destitute of advantages; I believe many people would have
pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``a fine woman;''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>and yet there were points in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) robust
and ample attractions, as well as in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bustling and demonstrative
presence, which, it appeared, the nice and capricious tastes of M. Paul
could not away with. The sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice, echoing through the carré,
would put him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) into a strange taking; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) long free step--almost
stride--along the corridor, would often make him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) snatch up his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) papers
and decamp on the instant.

<p/>With malicious intent he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bethought himself, one day, to intrude on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
class; as quick as lightning he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gathered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) method of instruction; it
differed from a pet plan of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own. With little ceremony, and less
courtesy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pointed out what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) termed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) errors. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) expected
submission and attention, I know not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) met an acrid opposition,
accompanied by a round reprimand for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) certainly unjustifiable
interference.

<p/>Instead of withdrawing with dignity, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) might still have done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
threw down the gauntlet of defiance. Madame Panache, bellicose as a
Penthesilea, picked it up in a minute. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) snapped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers in the
intermeddler's face; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rushed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with a storm of words. M.
Emanuel was eloquent; but Madame Panache was voluble. A system of
fierce antagonism ensued. Instead of laughing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) sleeve at his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) fair
foe, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sore amour-propre and loud self-assertion, M. Paul
detested her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with intense seriousness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) honoured her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) earnest
fury; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) vindictively and implacably, refusing to rest
peaceably in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bed, to derive due benefit from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) meals, or even
serenely to relish his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cigar, till she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was fairly rooted out of the
establishment. The Professor conquered, but I cannot say that the
laurels of this victory shadowed gracefully his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) temples. Once I
ventured to hint as much. To my great surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) allowed that I might
be right, but averred that when brought into contact with either men or
women of the coarse, self-complacent quality, whereof Madame Panache
was a specimen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had no control over his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) own passions; an unspeakable
and active aversion impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) to a war of extermination.

<p/>Three months afterwards, hearing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) vanquished foe had met with
reverses, and was likely to be really distressed for want of
employment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) hatred, and alike active in good and evil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
moved heaven and earth till he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) a place. Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) coming to
make up former differences, and thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) recent kindness, the
old voice--a little loud--the old manner--a little forward--so acted
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) that in ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) started up and bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), or rather
himself, out of the room, in a transport of nervous irritation.

<p/>To pursue a somewhat audacious parallel, in a love of power, in an
eager grasp after supremacy, M. Emanuel was like Bonaparte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was a
man not always to be submitted to. Sometimes it was needful to resist;
it was right to stand still, to look up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) eyes and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) requirements went beyond reason--that his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) absolutism verged on
tyranny.

<p/>The dawnings, the first developments of peculiar talent appearing
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) range, and under his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) rule, curiously excited, even disturbed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) watched its struggle into life with a scowl; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) held back his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
hand--perhaps said, <div class="bookquote">``Come on if you have strength,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but would not aid
the birth.

<p/>When the pang and peril of the first conflict were over, when the
breath of life was drawn, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) saw the lungs expand and contract,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) felt the heart beat and discovered life in the eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) did not
yet offer to foster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prove yourself true ere I cherish you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) ordinance; and how
difficult he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) made that proof! What thorns and briers, what flints, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
strewed in the path of feet not inured to rough travel! He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) watched
tearlessly--ordeals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) exacted should be passed
through--fearlessly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) followed footprints that, as they approached
the bourne, were sometimes marked in blood--followed them grimly,
holding the austerest police-watch over the pain-pressed pilgrim. And
when at last he (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) allowed a rest, before slumber might close the eyelids,
he (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) opened those same lids wide, with pitiless finger and thumb, and
gazed deep through the pupil and the irids into the brain, into the
heart, to search if Vanity, or Pride, or Falsehood, in any of its
subtlest forms, was discoverable in the furthest recess of existence.
If, at last, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) let the neophyte sleep, it was but a moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) woke
him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) suddenly up to apply new tests: he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) on irksome errands when
he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) was staggering with weariness; he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) tried the temper, the sense, and
the health; and it was only when every severest test had been applied
and endured, when the most corrosive aquafortis had been used, and
failed to tarnish the ore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) admitted it genuine, and, still in
clouded silence, stamped it with his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) deep brand of approval.

<p/>I speak not ignorant of these evils.

<p/>Till the date at which the last chapter closes, M. Paul had not been my
professor--he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had not given me lessons, but about that time,
accidentally hearing me one day acknowledge an ignorance of some branch
of education -LRB-I think it was arithmetic-RRB-, which would have disgraced a
charity-school boy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) very truly remarked, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took me in hand,
examined me first, found me, I need not say, abundantly deficient, gave
me some books and appointed me some tasks.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did this at first with pleasure, indeed with unconcealed exultation,
condescending to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) believed I was <div class="bookquote">``bonne et pas trop faible''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-i.e. well enough disposed, and not wholly destitute of parts-RRB-, but,
owing he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) supposed to adverse circumstances, <div class="bookquote">``as yet in a state of
wretchedly imperfect mental development.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The beginning of all effort has indeed with me been marked by a
preternatural imbecility. I never could, even in forming a common
acquaintance, assert or prove a claim to average quickness. A
depressing and difficult passage has prefaced every new page I have
turned in life.

<p/>So long as this passage lasted, M. Paul was very kind, very good, very
forbearing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) saw the sharp pain inflicted, and felt the weighty
humiliation imposed by my own sense of incapacity; and words can hardly
do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tenderness and helpfulness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own eyes would
moisten, when tears of shame and effort clouded mine; burdened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was with work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would steal half his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brief space of recreation to
give to me.

<p/>But, strange grief! when that heavy and overcast dawn began at last to
yield to day; when my faculties began to struggle themselves, free, and
my time of energy and fulfilment came; when I voluntarily doubled,
trebled, quadrupled the tasks he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) set, to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) as I thought, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
kindness became sternness; the light changed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyes from a beam to
a spark; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) fretted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) opposed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) curbed me imperiously; the more I
did, the harder I worked, the less he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) seemed content. Sarcasms of which
the severity amazed and puzzled me, harassed my ears; then flowed out
the bitterest inuendoes against the <div class="bookquote">``pride of intellect.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I was vaguely
threatened with I know not what doom, if I ever trespassed the limits
proper to my sex, and conceived a contraband appetite for unfeminine
knowledge. Alas! I had no such appetite. What I loved, it joyed me by
any effort to content; but the noble hunger for science in the
abstract--the godlike thirst after discovery--these feelings were known
to me but by briefest flashes.

<p/>Yet, when M. Paul sneered at me, I wanted to possess them more fully;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) injustice stirred in me ambitious wishes--it imparted a strong
stimulus--it gave wings to aspiration.

<p/>In the beginning, before I had penetrated to motives, that
uncomprehended sneer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made my heart ache, but by-and-by it only
warmed the blood in my veins, and sent added action to my pulses.
Whatever my powers--feminine or the contrary--God had given them, and I
felt resolute to be ashamed of no faculty of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bestowal.

<p/>The combat was very sharp for a time. I seemed to have lost M. Paul's
affection; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) treated me strangely. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) most unjust moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would
insinuate that I had deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) when I appeared, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) called
<div class="bookquote">``faible'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--that is incompetent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said I had feigned a false
incapacity. Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would turn suddenly round and accuse me of the
most far-fetched imitations and impossible plagiarisms, asserting that
I had extracted the pith out of books I had not so much as heard
of--and over the perusal of which I should infallibly have fallen down
in a sleep as deep as that of Eutychus.

<p/>Once, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) preferring such an accusation, I turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)--I rose
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Gathering an armful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) books out of my desk, I filled
my apron and poured them in a heap upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) estrade, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take them away, M. Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``and teach me no more. I never asked
to be made learned, and you compel me to feel very profoundly that
learning is not happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And returning to my desk, I laid my head on my arms, nor would I speak
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for two days afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pained and chagrined me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
affection had been very sweet and dear--a pleasure new and
incomparable: now that this seemed withdrawn, I cared not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
lessons.

<p/>The books, however, were not taken away; they were all restored with
careful hand to their places, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) came as usual to teach me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) peace somehow--too readily, perhaps: I ought to have stood out
longer, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked kind and good, and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand with
amity, memory refused to reproduce with due force his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) oppressive
moments. And then, reconcilement is always sweet!

<p/>On a certain morning a message came from my godmother, inviting me to
attend some notable lecture to be delivered in the same public rooms
before described. Dr. John had brought the message himself, and
delivered it verbally to Rosine, who had not scrupled to follow the
steps of M. Emanuel, then passing to the first classe, and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
presence, stand <div class="bookquote">``carrément''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>before my desk, hand in apron-pocket, and
rehearse the same, saucily and aloud, concluding with the words, <div class="bookquote">``Qu'il
est vraiment beau, Mademoiselle, ce jeune docteur! Quels yeux--quel
regard! Tenez! J'en ai le coeur tout ému!''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) was gone, my professor demanded of me why I suffered <div class="bookquote">``cette
fille effrontée, cette créature sans pudeur,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>to address me in such
terms.

<p/>I had no pacifying answer to give. The terms were precisely such as
Rosine--a young lady in whose skull the organs of reverence and reserve
were not largely developed--was in the constant habit of using.
Besides, what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said about the young doctor was true enough. Graham
_was_ handsome; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had fine eyes and a thrilling glance. An
observation to that effect actually formed itself into sound on my lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elle ne dit que la vérité,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! vous trouvez?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais, sans doute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The lesson to which we had that day to submit was such as to make us
very glad when it terminated. At its close, the released, pupils rushed
out, half-trembling, half-exultant. I, too, was going. A mandate to
remain arrested me. I muttered that I wanted some fresh air sadly--the
stove was in a glow, the classe over-heated. An inexorable voice merely
recommended silence; and this salamander--for whom no room ever seemed
too hot--sitting down between my desk and the stove--a situation in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to have felt broiled, but did not--proceeded to confront
me with--a Greek quotation!

<p/>In M. Emanuel's soul rankled a chronic suspicion that I knew both Greek
and Latin. As monkeys are said to have the power of speech if they
would but use it, and are reported to conceal this faculty in fear of
its being turned to their detriment, so to me was ascribed a fund of
knowledge which I was supposed criminally and craftily to conceal. The
privileges of a <div class="bookquote">``classical education,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>it was insinuated, had been
mine; on flowers of Hymettus I had revelled; a golden store, hived in
memory, now silently sustained my efforts, and privily nurtured my wits.

<p/>A hundred expedients did M. Paul employ to surprise my secret--to
wheedle, to threaten, to startle it out of me. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) placed
Greek and Latin books in my way, and then watched me, as Joan of Arc's
jailors tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) with the warrior's accoutrements, and lay in wait
for the issue. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) quoted I know not what authors and passages,
and while rolling out their sweet and sounding lines -LRB-the classic tones
fell musically from his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) lips--for he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) had a good voice--remarkable for
compass, modulation, and matchless expression-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) would fix on me a
vigilant, piercing, and often malicious eye. It was evident he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>)
sometimes expected great demonstrations; they never occurred, however;
not comprehending, of course I could neither be charmed nor annoyed.

<p/>Baffled--almost angry--he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) still clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) fixed idea; my
susceptibilities were pronounced marble--my face a mask. It appeared as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) could not be brought to accept the homely truth, and take me for
what I was: men, and women too, must have delusion of some sort; if not
made ready to their hand, they will invent exaggeration for themselves.

<p/>At moments I _did_ wish that his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) suspicions had been better founded.
There were times when I would have given my right hand to possess the
treasures he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) ascribed to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) deserved condign punishment for his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>)
testy crotchets. I could have gloried in bringing home to him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) worst
apprehensions astoundingly realized. I could have exulted to burst on
his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) vision, confront and confound his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``lunettes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>one blaze of
acquirements. Oh! why did nobody undertake to make me clever while I
was young enough to learn, that I might, by one grand, sudden, inhuman
revelation--one cold, cruel, overwhelming triumph--have for ever
crushed the mocking spirit out of Paul Carl David Emanuel!

<p/>Alas! no such feat was in my power. To-day, as usual, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) quotations
fell ineffectual: he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) soon shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Women of intellect''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) next theme: here he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was at home. A <div class="bookquote">``woman
of intellect,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife worker</b></font>)</div>it appeared, was a sort of <div class="bookquote">``lusus naturae,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife worker</b></font>)</div>a luckless
accident, a thing for which there was neither place nor use in
creation, wanted neither as wife nor worker. Beauty anticipated her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in
the first office. He (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) soul that lovely, placid, and
passive feminine mediocrity was the only pillow on which manly thought
and sense could find rest for its aching temples; and as to work, male
mind alone could work to any good practical result--hein?

<p/>This <div class="bookquote">``hein?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>was a note of interrogation intended to draw from me
contradiction or objection. However, I only said--<div class="bookquote">``Cela ne me regarde
pas: je ne m`en soucie pas;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and presently added--<div class="bookquote">``May I go, Monsieur?
They have rung the bell for the second déjeuner''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-_i.e._ luncheon-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What of that? You are not hungry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; <div class="bookquote">``I had had nothing since breakfast, at seven,
and should have nothing till dinner, at five, if I missed this bell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) was in the same plight, but I might share with him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) broke in two the <div class="bookquote">``brioche''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>intended for his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) own refreshment, and
gave me half. Truly his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) bark was worse than his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) bite; but the really
formidable attack was yet to come. While eating his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) cake, I could not
forbear expressing my secret wish that I really knew all of which he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>)
accused me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I sincerely feel myself to be an ignoramus?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) asked, in a
softened tone.

<p/>If I had replied meekly by an unqualified affirmative, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>)
would have stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) hand, and we should have been friends on
the spot, but I answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly. I am ignorant, Monsieur, in the knowledge you ascribe to
me, but I _sometimes_, not _always_, feel a knowledge of my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) inquired, sharply.

<p/>Unable to answer this question in a breath, I evaded it by change of
subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) had now finished his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) half of the brioche feeling sure that
on so trifling a fragment he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) could not have satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) appetite, as
indeed I had not appeased mine, and inhaling the fragrance of baked
apples afar from the refectory, I ventured to inquire whether he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) did
not also perceive that agreeable odour. He (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) did. I
said if he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) would let me out by the garden-door, and permit me just to
run across the court, I would fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) a plateful; and added that I
believed they were excellent, as Goton had a very good method of
baking, or rather stewing fruit, putting in a little spice, sugar, and
a glass or two of vin blanc--might I go?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Petite gourmande!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>), smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I have not forgotten how pleased
you were with the pâté â la crême I once gave you, and you know very
well, at this moment, that to fetch the apples for me will be the same
as getting them for yourself. Go, then, but come back quickly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And at last he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) liberated me on parole. My own plan was to go and return
with speed and good faith, to put the plate in at the door, and then to
vanish incontinent, leaving all consequences for future settlement.

<p/>That intolerably keen instinct of his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) seemed to have anticipated my
scheme: he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) met me at the threshold, hurried me into the room, and fixed
me in a minute in my former seat. Taking the plate of fruit from my
hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) divided the portion intended only for himself, and ordered me
to eat my share. I complied with no good grace, and vexed, I suppose,
by my reluctance, he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) opened a masked and dangerous battery. All he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) had
yet said, I could count as mere sound and fury, signifying nothing: not
so of the present attack.

<p/>It consisted in an unreasonable proposition with which he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) had before
afflicted me: namely, that on the next public examination-day I should
engage--foreigner as I was--to take my place on the first form of
first-class pupils, and with them improvise a composition in French, on
any subject any spectator might dictate, without benefit of grammar or
lexicon.

<p/>I knew what the result of such an experiment would be. I, to whom
nature had denied the impromptu faculty; who, in public, was by nature
a cypher; whose time of mental activity, even when alone, was not under
the meridian sun; who needed the fresh silence of morning, or the
recluse peace of evening, to win from the Creative Impulse one evidence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) presence, one proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) force; I, with whom that Impulse was
the most intractable, the most capricious, the most maddening of
masters -LRB-him (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) before me always excepted-RRB---a deity which sometimes, under
circumstances--apparently propitious, would not speak when questioned,
would not hear when appealed to, would not, when sought, be found; but
would stand, all cold, all indurated, all granite, a dark Baal with
carven lips and blank eye-balls, and breast like the stone face of a
tomb; and again, suddenly, at some turn, some sound, some
long-trembling sob of the wind, at some rushing past of an unseen
stream of electricity, the irrational demon would wake unsolicited,
would stir strangely alive, would rush from its pedestal like a
perturbed Dagon, calling to its votary for a sacrifice, whatever the
hour--to its victim for some blood, or some breath, whatever the
circumstance or scene--rousing its priest, treacherously promising
vaticination, perhaps filling its temple with a strange hum of oracles,
but sure to give half the significance to fateful winds, and grudging
to the desperate listener even a miserable remnant--yielding it
sordidly, as though each word had been a drop of the deathless ichor of
its own dark veins. And this tyrant I was to compel into bondage, and
make it improvise a theme, on a school estrade, between a Mathilde and
a Coralie, under the eye of a Madame Beck, for the pleasure, and to the
inspiration of a bourgeois of Labassecour!

<p/>Upon this argument M. Paul and I did battle more than once--strong
battle, with confused noise of demand and rejection, exaction and
repulse.

<p/>On this particular day I was soundly rated. <div class="bookquote">``The obstinacy of my whole
sex,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>it seems, was concentrated in me; I had an <div class="bookquote">``orgueil de diable.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
feared to fail, forsooth! What did it matter whether I failed or not?
Who was I that I should not fail, like my betters? It would do me good
to fail. He (<font color='blue'><b>betters</b></font>) wanted to see me worsted -LRB-I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>betters</b></font>) did-RRB-, and one minute he (<font color='blue'><b>betters</b></font>)
paused to take breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would I speak now, and be tractable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never would I be tractable in this matter. Law itself should not
compel me. I would pay a fine, or undergo an imprisonment, rather than
write for a show and to order, perched up on a platform.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could softer motives influence me? Would I yield for friendship's
sake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a whit, not a hair-breadth. No form of friendship under the sun
had a right to exact such a concession. No true friendship would harass
me thus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>betters</b></font>) supposed then -LRB-with a sneer--M. Paul could sneer supremely, curling
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lip, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nostrils, contracting his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyelids-RRB---he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) supposed
there was but one form of appeal to which I would listen, and of that
form it was not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to make use.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Under certain persuasions, from certain quarters, je vous vois d'ici,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``eagerly subscribing to the sacrifice, passionately arming for
the effort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Making a simpleton, a warning, and an example of myself, before a
hundred and fifty of the `papas' and `mammas' of Villette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And here, losing patience, I broke out afresh with a cry that I wanted
to be liberated--to get out into the air--I was almost in a fever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chut!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the inexorable, <div class="bookquote">``this was a mere pretext to run away; _he (<font color='blue'><b>papas</b></font>)_
was not hot, with the stove close at his (<font color='blue'><b>papas</b></font>) back; how could I suffer,
thoroughly screened by his (<font color='blue'><b>papas</b></font>) person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not understand his (<font color='blue'><b>papas</b></font>) constitution. I knew nothing of the natural
history of salamanders. For my own part, I was a phlegmatic islander,
and sitting in an oven did not agree with me; at least, might I step to
the well, and get a glass of water--the sweet apples had made me
thirsty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that was all, he (<font color='blue'><b>papas</b></font>) would do my errand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went to fetch the water. Of course, with a door only on the latch
behind me, I lost not my opportunity. Ere his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) return, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) half-worried
prey had escaped.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXI.

<p/>THE DRYAD.


<p/>The spring was advancing, and the weather had turned suddenly warm.
This change of temperature brought with it for me, as probably for many
others, temporary decrease of strength. Slight exertion at this time
left me overcome with fatigue--sleepless nights entailed languid days.

<p/>One Sunday afternoon, having walked the distance of half a league to
the Protestant church, I came back weary and exhausted; and taking
refuge in my solitary sanctuary, the first classe, I was glad to sit
down, and to make of my desk a pillow for my arms and head.

<p/>Awhile I listened to the lullaby of bees humming in the berceau, and
watched, through the glass door and the tender, lightly-strewn spring
foliage, Madame Beck and a gay party of friends, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had
entertained that day at dinner after morning mass, walking in the
centre-alley under orchard boughs dressed at this season in blossom,
and wearing a colouring as pure and warm as mountain-snow at sun-rise.

<p/>My principal attraction towards this group of guests lay, I remember,
in one figure--that of a handsome young girl whom I had seen before as
a visitor at Madame Beck's, and of whom I had been vaguely told that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``filleule,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>or god-daughter, of M. Emanuel's, and that
between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, or aunt, or some other female relation of hers, and
the Professor, had existed of old a special friendship. M. Paul was not
of the holiday band to-day, but I had seen this young girl with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ere
now, and as far as distant observation could enable me to judge, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
seemed to enjoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with the frank ease of a ward with an indulgent
guardian. I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) run up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and
hang upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Once, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did so, a curious sensation had struck
through me--a disagreeable anticipatory sensation--one of the family of
presentiments, I suppose--but I refused to analyze or dwell upon it.
While watching this girl, Mademoiselle Sauveur by name, and following
the gleam of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bright silk robe -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was always richly dressed, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was said to be wealthy-RRB- through the flowers and the glancing leaves
of tender emerald, my eyes became dazzled--they closed; my lassitude,
the warmth of the day, the hum of bees and birds, all lulled me, and at
last I slept.

<p/>Two hours stole over me. Ere I woke, the sun had declined out of sight
behind the towering houses, the garden and the room were grey, bees had
gone homeward, and the flowers were closing; the party of guests, too,
had vanished; each alley was void.

<p/>On waking, I felt much at ease--not chill, as I ought to have been
after sitting so still for at least two hours; my cheek and arms were
not benumbed by pressure against the hard desk. No wonder. Instead of
the bare wood on which I had laid them, I found a thick shawl,
carefully folded, substituted for support, and another shawl -LRB-both
taken from the corridor where such things hung-RRB- wrapped warmly round me.

<p/>Who had done this? Who was my friend? Which of the teachers? Which of
the pupils? None, except St. Pierre, was inimical to me; but which of
them had the art, the thought, the habit, of benefiting thus tenderly?
Which of them had a step so quiet, a hand so gentle, but I should have
heard or felt her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had approached or touched me in a day-sleep?

<p/>As to Ginevra Fanshawe, that bright young creature was not gentle at
all, and would certainly have pulled me out of my chair, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had
meddled in the matter. I said at last: <div class="bookquote">``It is Madame Beck's doing; she (<font color='blue'><b>islander</b></font>)
has come in, seen me asleep, and thought I might take cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>islander</b></font>)
considers me a useful machine, answering well the purpose for which it
was hired; so would not have me needlessly injured. And now,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>methought, <div class="bookquote">``I'll take a walk; the evening is fresh, and not very chill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>So I opened the glass door and stepped into the berceau.

<p/>I went to my own alley: had it been dark, or even dusk, I should have
hardly ventured there, for I had not yet forgotten the curious illusion
of vision -LRB-if illusion it were-RRB- experienced in that place some months
ago. But a ray of the setting sun burnished still the grey crown of
Jean Baptiste; nor had all the birds of the garden yet vanished into
their nests amongst the tufted shrubs and thick wall-ivy. I paced up
and down, thinking almost the same thoughts I had pondered that night
when I buried my glass jar--how I should make some advance in life,
take another step towards an independent position; for this train of
reflection, though not lately pursued, had never by me been wholly
abandoned; and whenever a certain eye was averted from me, and a
certain countenance grew dark with unkindness and injustice, into that
track of speculation did I at once strike; so that, little by little, I
had laid half a plan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Living costs little,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I to myself, ``in this economical town of
Villette, where people are more sensible than I understand they are in
dear old England--infinitely less worried about appearance, and less
emulous of display--where nobody is in the least ashamed to be quite as
homely and saving as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) finds convenient. House-rent, in a prudently
chosen situation, need not be high. When I shall have saved one
thousand francs, I will take a tenement with one large room, and two or
three smaller ones, furnish the first with a few benches and desks, a
black tableau, an estrade for myself; upon it a chair and table, with a
sponge and some white chalks; begin with taking day-pupils, and so work
my way upwards. Madame Beck's commencement was--as I have often heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) say--from no higher starting-point, and where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) now? All these
premises and this garden are hers, bought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) money; she (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) has a
competency already secured for old age, and a flourishing establishment
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) direction, which will furnish a career for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, Lucy Snowe! With self-denial and economy now, and steady
exertion by-and-by, an object in life need not fail you. Venture not to
complain that such an object is too selfish, too limited, and lacks
interest; be content to labour for independence until you have proved,
by winning that prize, your right to look higher. But afterwards, is
there nothing more for me in life--no true home--nothing to be dearer
to me than myself, and by its paramount preciousness, to draw from me
better things than I care to culture for myself only? Nothing, at whose
feet I can willingly lay down the whole burden of human egotism, and
gloriously take up the nobler charge of labouring and living for
others? I suppose, Lucy Snowe, the orb of your life is not to be so
rounded: for you, the crescent-phase must suffice. Very good. I see a
huge mass of my fellow-creatures in no better circumstances. I see that
a great many men, and more women, hold their span of life on conditions
of denial and privation. I find no reason why I should be of the few
favoured. I believe in some blending of hope and sunshine sweetening
the worst lots. I believe that this life is not all; neither the
beginning nor the end. I believe while I tremble; I trust while I weep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So this subject is done with. It is right to look our life-accounts
bravely in the face now and then, and settle them honestly. And he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is a
poor self-swindler who lies to himself while he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) reckons the items, and
sets down under the head--happiness that which is misery. Call
anguish--anguish, and despair--despair; write both down in strong
characters with a resolute pen: you will the better pay your debt to
Doom. Falsify: insert <div class="bookquote">``privilege''  (<font color='red'><b>creditor</b></font>)</div>where you should have written <div class="bookquote">``pain;''
 (<font color='red'><b>creditor</b></font>)</div>and see if your mighty creditor will allow the fraud to pass, or accept
the coin with which you would cheat him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>). Offer to the strongest--if the
darkest angel of God's host--water, when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has asked blood--will he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
take it? Not a whole pale sea for one red drop. I settled another
account.

<p/>Pausing before Methusaleh--the giant and patriarch of the garden--and
leaning my brow against his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) knotty trunk, my foot rested on the stone
sealing the small sepulchre at his (<font color='blue'><b>patriarch</b></font>) root; and I recalled the passage of
feeling therein buried; I recalled Dr. John; my warm affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>);
my faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) excellence; my delight in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) grace. What was become of
that curious one-sided friendship which was half marble and half life;
only on one hand truth, and on the other perhaps a jest?

<p/>Was this feeling dead? I do not know, but it was buried. Sometimes I
thought the tomb unquiet, and dreamed strangely of disturbed earth, and
of hair, still golden, and living, obtruded through coffin-chinks.

<p/>Had I been too hasty? I used to ask myself; and this question would
occur with a cruel sharpness after some brief chance interview with Dr.
John. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had still such kind looks, such a warm hand; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice still
kept so pleasant a tone for my name; I never liked <div class="bookquote">``Lucy''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>so well as
when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) uttered it. But I learned in time that this benignity, this
cordiality, this music, belonged in no shape to me: it was a part of
himself; it was the honey of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) temper; it was the balm of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mellow
mood; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) imparted it, as the ripe fruit rewards with sweetness the
rifling bee; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) diffused it about him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), as sweet plants shed their
perfume. Does the nectarine love either the bee or bird it feeds? Is
the sweetbriar enamoured of the air?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Dr. John; you are good, you are beautiful; but you are not
mine. Good-night, and God bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus I closed my musings. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>left my lips in sound; I heard
the words spoken, and then I heard an echo--quite close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Mademoiselle; or, rather, good-evening--the sun is scarce
set; I hope you slept well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I started, but was only discomposed a moment; I knew the voice and
speaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Slept, Monsieur! When? where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well inquire when--where. It seems you turn day into night,
and choose a desk for a pillow; rather hard lodging--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was softened for me, Monsieur, while I slept. That unseen,
gift-bringing thing which haunts my desk, remembered me. No matter how
I fell asleep; I awoke pillowed and covered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did the shawls keep you warm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very warm. Do you ask thanks for them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. You looked pale in your slumbers: are you home-sick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be home-sick, one must have a home; which I have not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you have more need of a careful friend. I scarcely know any one,
Miss Lucy, who needs a friend more absolutely than you; your very
faults imperatively require it. You want so much checking, regulating,
and keeping down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This idea of <div class="bookquote">``keeping down''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>never left M. Paul's head; the most
habitual subjugation would, in my case, have failed to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) of
it. No matter; what did it signify? I listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and did not
trouble myself to be too submissive; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) occupation would have been
gone had I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nothing to <div class="bookquote">``keep down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need watching, and watching over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pursued; <div class="bookquote">``and it is well for
you that I see this, and do my best to discharge both duties. I watch
you and others pretty closely, pretty constantly, nearer and oftener
than you or they think. Do you see that window with a light in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pointed to a lattice in one of the college boarding-houses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is a room I have hired, nominally for a
study--virtually for a post of observation. There I sit and read for
hours together: it is my way--my taste. My book is this garden; its
contents are human nature--female human nature. I know you all by
heart. Ah! I know you well--St. Pierre, the Parisienne--cette
maîtresse-femme, my cousin Beck herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not right, Monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Comment? it is not right? By whose creed? Does some dogma of Calvin or
Luther condemn it? What is that to me? I am no Protestant. My rich
father -LRB-for, though I have known poverty, and once starved for a year
in a garret in Rome--starved wretchedly, often on a meal a day, and
sometimes not that--yet I was born to wealth-RRB---my rich father was a
good Catholic; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave me a priest and a Jesuit for a tutor. I
retain his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lessons; and to what discoveries, grand Dieu! have they not
aided me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Discoveries made by stealth seem to me dishonourable discoveries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Puritaine! I doubt it not. Yet see how my Jesuit's system works. You
know the St. Pierre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partially.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You say right--_`partially'_; whereas _I_ know her (<font color='blue'><b>tutor</b></font>)
_thoroughly_; there is the difference. She (<font color='blue'><b>tutor</b></font>) played before me the
amiable; offered me patte de velours; caressed, flattered, fawned on
me. Now, I am accessible to a woman's flattery--accessible against my
reason. Though never pretty, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was--when I first knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--young, or
knew how to look young. Like all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) countrywomen, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the art of
dressing--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a certain cool, easy, social assurance, which spared
me the pain of embarrassment--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, that must have been unnecessary. I never saw you embarrassed
in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle, you know little of me; I can be embarrassed as a petite
pensionnaire; there is a fund of modesty and diffidence in my nature--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, I never saw it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle, it is there. You ought to have seen it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, I have observed you in public--on platforms, in tribunes,
before titles and crowned heads--and you were as easy as you are in the
third division.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle, neither titles nor crowned heads excite my modesty; and
publicity is very much my element. I like it well, and breathe in it
quite freely;--but--but, in short, here is the sentiment brought into
action, at this very moment; however, I disdain to be worsted by it.
If, Mademoiselle, I were a marrying man -LRB-which I am not; and you may
spare yourself the trouble of any sneer you may be contemplating at the
thought-RRB-, and found it necessary to ask a lady whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could look
upon me in the light of a future husband, then would it be proved that
I am as I say--modest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I quite believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) now; and, in believing, I honoured him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with a
sincerity of esteem which made my heart ache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the St. Pierre,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went on, recovering himself, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) voice
had altered a little, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) once intended to be Madame Emanuel; and I
don't know whither I might have been led, but for yonder little lattice
with the light. Ah, magic lattice! what miracles of discovery hast thou
wrought! Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rancours, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) vanities, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
levities--not only here, but elsewhere: I have witnessed what bucklers
me against all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arts: I am safe from poor Zélie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my pupils,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) presently recommenced, <div class="bookquote">``those blondes jeunes
filles--so mild and meek--I have seen the most reserved--romp like
boys, the demurest--snatch grapes from the walls, shake pears from the
trees. When the English teacher came, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), marked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) early
preference for this alley, noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) taste for seclusion, watched her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
well, long before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and I came to speaking terms; do you recollect my
once coming silently and offering you a little knot of white violets
when we were strangers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I recollect it. I dried the violets, kept them, and have them still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It pleased me when you took them peacefully and promptly, without
prudery--that sentiment which I ever dread to excite, and which, when
it is revealed in eye or gesture, I vindictively detest. To return. Not
only did _I_ watch you; but often--especially at eventide--another
guardian angel was noiselessly hovering near: night after night my
cousin Beck has stolen down yonder steps, and glidingly pursued your
movements when you did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Monsieur, you could not from the distance of that window see what
passed in this garden at night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By moonlight I possibly might with a glass--I use a glass--but the
garden itself is open to me. In the shed, at the bottom, there is a
door leading into a court, which communicates with the college; of that
door I possess the key, and thus come and go at pleasure. This
afternoon I came through it, and found you asleep in classe; again this
evening I have availed myself of the same entrance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help saying, <div class="bookquote">``If you were a wicked, designing man, how
terrible would all this be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) attention seemed incapable of being arrested by this view of the
subject: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cigar, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) puffed it, leaning against a
tree, and looking at me in a cool, amused way he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had when his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) humour
was tranquil, I thought proper to go on sermonizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) often
lectured me by the hour together--I did not see why I should not speak
my mind for once. So I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) my impressions concerning his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
Jesuit-system.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The knowledge it brings you is bought too dear, Monsieur; this coming
and going by stealth degrades your own dignity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dignity!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cried, laughing; ``when did you ever see me trouble my
head about my dignity? It is you, Miss Lucy, who are ``digne.<div class="bookquote">'' How
often, in your high insular presence, have I taken a pleasure in
trampling upon, what you are pleased to call, my dignity; tearing it,
scattering it to the winds, in those mad transports you witness with
such hauteur, and which I know you think very like the ravings of a
third-rate London actor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, I tell you every glance you cast from that lattice is a
wrong done to the best part of your own nature. To study the human
heart thus, is to banquet secretly and sacrilegiously on Eve's apples.
I wish you were a Protestant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Indifferent to the wish, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) smoked on. After a space of smiling yet
thoughtful silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) said, rather suddenly--<div class="bookquote">``I have seen other
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What other things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Taking the weed from his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) threw the remnant amongst the shrubs,
where, for a moment, it lay glowing in the gloom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``is not that spark like an eye watching you and
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) took a turn down the walk; presently returning, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) went on:--<div class="bookquote">``I have
seen, Miss Lucy, things to me unaccountable, that have made me watch
all night for a solution, and I have not yet found it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The tone was peculiar; my veins thrilled; he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) saw me shiver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you afraid? Whether is it of my words or that red jealous eye just
winking itself out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am cold; the night grows dark and late, and the air is changed; it
is time to go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is little past eight, but you shall go in soon. Answer me only this
question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) paused ere he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) put it. The garden was truly growing dark; dusk
had come on with clouds, and drops of rain began to patter through the
trees. I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) would feel this, but, for the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) seemed too
much absorbed to be sensible of the change.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle, do you Protestants believe in the supernatural?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a difference of theory and belief on this point amongst
Protestants as amongst other sects,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Monsieur, do you
ask such a question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you shrink and speak so faintly? Are you superstitious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am constitutionally nervous. I dislike the discussion of such
subjects. I dislike it the more because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No: but it has happened to me to experience impressions--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you came here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; not many months ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here?--in this house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Bon! I am glad of it. I knew it, somehow; before you told me. I was
conscious of rapport between you and myself. You are patient, and I am
choleric; you are quiet and pale, and I am tanned and fiery; you are a
strict Protestant, and I am a sort of lay Jesuit: but we are
alike--there is affinity between us. Do you see it, Mademoiselle, when
you look in the glass? Do you observe that your forehead is shaped like
mine--that your eyes are cut like mine? Do you hear that you have some
of my tones of voice? Do you know that you have many of my looks? I
perceive all this, and believe that you were born under my star. Yes,
you were born under my star! Tremble! for where that is the case with
mortals, the threads of their destinies are difficult to disentangle;
knottings and catchings occur--sudden breaks leave damage in the web.
But these ``impressions,<div class="bookquote">'' as you say, with English caution. I, too, have
had my `impressions.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, tell me them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I desire no better, and intend no less. You know the legend of this
house and garden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it. Yes. They say that hundreds of years ago a nun was buried
here alive at the foot of this very tree, beneath the ground which now
bears us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that in former days a nun's ghost used to come and go here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, what if it comes and goes here still?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something comes and goes here: there is a shape frequenting this house
by night, different to any forms that show themselves by day. I have
indisputably seen a something, more than once; and to me its conventual
weeds were a strange sight, saying more than they can do to any other
living being. A nun!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, I, too, have seen it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I anticipated that. Whether this nun be flesh and blood, or something
that remains when blood is dried, and flesh is wasted, her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) business is
as much with you as with me, probably. Well, I mean to make it out; it
has baffled me so far, but I mean to follow up the mystery. I mean--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of telling what he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) meant, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) head suddenly; I made
the same movement in the same instant; we both looked to one point--the
high tree shadowing the great berceau, and resting some of its boughs
on the roof of the first classe. There had been a strange and
inexplicable sound from that quarter, as if the arms of that tree had
swayed of their own motion, and its weight of foliage had rushed and
crushed against the massive trunk. Yes; there scarce stirred a breeze,
and that heavy tree was convulsed, whilst the feathery shrubs stood
still. For some minutes amongst the wood and leafage a rending and
heaving went on. Dark as it was, it seemed to me that something more
solid than either night-shadow, or branch-shadow, blackened out of the
boles. At last the struggle ceased. What birth succeeded this travail?
What Dryad was born of these throes? We watched fixedly. A sudden bell
rang in the house--the prayer-bell. Instantly into our alley there
came, out of the berceau, an apparition, all black and white. With a
sort of angry rush-close, close past our faces--swept swiftly the very
NUN herself! Never had I seen her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so clearly. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looked tall of
stature, and fierce of gesture. As she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went, the wind rose sobbing; the
rain poured wild and cold; the whole night seemed to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXXII.

<p/>THE FIRST LETTER.


<p/>Where, it becomes time to inquire, was Paulina Mary? How fared my
intercourse with the sumptuous Hôtel Crécy? That intercourse had, for
an interval, been suspended by absence; M. and Miss de Bassompierre had
been travelling, dividing some weeks between the provinces and capital
of France. Chance apprised me of their return very shortly after it
took place.

<p/>I was walking one mild afternoon on a quiet boulevard, wandering slowly
on, enjoying the benign April sun, and some thoughts not unpleasing,
when I saw before me a group of riders, stopping as if they had just
encountered, and exchanging greetings in the midst of the broad,
smooth, linden-bordered path; on one side a middle-aged gentleman and
young lady, on the other--a young and handsome man. Very graceful was
the lady's mien, choice her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appointments, delicate and stately her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
whole aspect. Still, as I looked, I felt they were known to me, and,
drawing a little nearer, I fully recognised them all: the Count Home de
Bassompierre, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) daughter, and Dr. Graham Bretton.

<p/>How animated was Graham's face! How true, how warm, yet how retiring
the joy it expressed! This was the state of things, this the
combination of circumstances, at once to attract and enchain, to subdue
and excite Dr. John. The pearl he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) admired was in itself of great price
and truest purity, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not the man who, in appreciating the gem,
could forget its setting. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seen Paulina with the same youth,
beauty, and grace, but on foot, alone, unguarded, and in simple attire,
a dependent worker, a demi-grisette, he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) would have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) a pretty
little creature, and would have loved with his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) eye her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) movements and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) mien, but it required other than this to conquer him (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) was now
vanquished, to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) safe under dominion as now, without loss, and
even with gain to his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) manly honour, one saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) was reduced; there
was about Dr. John all the man of the world; to satisfy himself did not
suffice; society must approve--the world must admire what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did, or he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
counted his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) measures false and futile. In his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) victrix he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) required all
that was here visible--the imprint of high cultivation, the
consecration of a careful and authoritative protection, the adjuncts
that Fashion decrees, Wealth purchases, and Taste adjusts; for these
conditions his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) spirit stipulated ere it surrendered: they were here to
the utmost fulfilled; and now, proud, impassioned, yet fearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did
homage to Paulina as his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sovereign. As for her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), the smile of feeling,
rather than of conscious power, slept soft in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>They parted. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) passed me at speed, hardly feeling the earth he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
skimmed, and seeing nothing on either hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looked very handsome;
mettle and purpose were roused in him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, there is Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a musical, friendly voice. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy, dear
Lucy--_do_ come here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hastened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) veil, and stooped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) saddle
to kiss me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was coming to see you to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but now to-morrow you
will come and see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) named the hour, and I promised compliance.

<p/>The morrow's evening found me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) and I shut into her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) own
room. I had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) since that occasion when her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) claims were
brought into comparison with those of Ginevra Fanshawe, and had so
signally prevailed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had much to tell me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) travels in the
interval. A most animated, rapid speaker was she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) in such a tête-à-tête,
a most lively describer; yet with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) artless diction and clear soft
voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) never seemed to speak too fast or to say too much. My own
attention I think would not soon have flagged, but by-and-by, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
herself seemed to need some change of subject; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) hastened to wind up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) narrative briefly. Yet why she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) terminated with so concise an
abridgment did not immediately appear; silence followed--a restless
silence, not without symptoms of abstraction. Then, turning to me, in a
diffident, half-appealing voice--<div class="bookquote">``Lucy--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am at your side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is my cousin Ginevra still at Madame Beck's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your cousin is still there; you must be longing to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) to spend another evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No... I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) still talks about being married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to any one you care for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) still thinks of Dr. Bretton? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) cannot have changed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) mind on that point, because it was so fixed two months ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you know, it does not matter. You saw the terms on which they
stood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a little misunderstanding that evening, certainly; does she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>)
seem unhappy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>). To change the subject. Have you heard or seen nothing of, or
from, Graham during your absence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa had letters from him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) once or twice about business, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)
undertook the management of some affair which required attention while
we were away. Dr. Bretton seems to respect papa, and to have pleasure
in obliging him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: you met him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) yesterday on the boulevard; you would be able to
judge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) aspect that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) friends need not be painfully anxious
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) health?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa seems to have thought with you. I could not help smiling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is
not particularly observant, you know, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is often thinking of
other things than what pass before his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) eyes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) said, as Dr.
Bretton rode away, Really it does a man good to see the spirit and
energy of that boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) called Dr. Bretton a boy; I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) almost
thinks him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) so, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) thinks me a little girl; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) was not speaking
to me, but dropped that remark to himself. Lucy...''

<p/>Again fell the appealing accent, and at the same instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
chair, and came and sat on the stool at my feet.

<p/>I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). It is not a declaration I have often made concerning my
acquaintance, in the course of this book: the reader will bear with it
for once. Intimate intercourse, close inspection, disclosed in Paulina
only what was delicate, intelligent, and sincere; therefore my regard
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lay deep. An admiration more superficial might have been more
demonstrative; mine, however, was quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you to ask of Lucy?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``be brave, and speak out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But there was no courage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) eye; as it met mine, it fell; and there
was no coolness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) cheek--not a transient surface-blush, but a
gathering inward excitement raised its tint and its temperature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, I _do_ wish to know your thoughts of Dr. Bretton. Do, _do_ give
me your real opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) character, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) disposition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) character stands high, and deservedly high.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) disposition? Tell me about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) disposition,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) urged; <div class="bookquote">``you
know him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) pretty well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) home-side. You have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mother; speak of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) as a son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) is a fine-hearted son; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) mother's comfort and hope, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pride and
pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) held my hand between hers, and at each favourable word gave it a
little caressing stroke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what other way is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) good, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Bretton is benevolent--humanely disposed towards all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) race, Dr.
Bretton would have benignity for the lowest savage, or the worst
criminal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard some gentlemen, some of papa's friends, who were talking about
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), say the same. They say many of the poor patients at the hospitals,
who tremble before some pitiless and selfish surgeons, welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are right; I have witnessed as much. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) once took me over a
hospital; I saw how he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was received: your father's friends are right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The softest gratitude animated her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) eye as she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lifted it a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
had yet more to say, but seemed hesitating about time and place. Dusk
was beginning to reign; her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) parlour fire already glowed with twilight
ruddiness; but I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) wished the room dimmer, the hour later.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How quiet and secluded we feel here!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked, to reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do we? Yes; it is a still evening, and I shall not be called down to
tea; papa is dining out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Still holding my hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) played with the fingers unconsciously,
dressed them, now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) own rings, and now circled them with a twine
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) beautiful hair; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) patted the palm against her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) hot cheek, and
at last, having cleared a voice that was naturally liquid as a lark's,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) said:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must think it rather strange that I should talk so much about Dr.
Bretton, ask so many questions, take such an interest, but--'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all strange; perfectly natural; you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), with slight quickness, <div class="bookquote">``is that a reason why
I should talk? I suppose you think me weak, like my cousin Ginevra?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I thought you one whit like Madame Ginevra, I would not sit here
waiting for your communications. I would get up, walk at my ease about
the room, and anticipate all you had to say by a round lecture. Go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>retorted she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``what else do you suppose I mean to
do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) looked and spoke--the little Polly of Bretton--petulant,
sensitive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>), emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``if I liked Dr. John till I was fit to
die for liking him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), that alone could not license me to be otherwise
than dumb--dumb as the grave--dumb as you, Lucy Snowe--you know it--and
you know you would despise me if I failed in self-control, and whined
about some rickety liking that was all on my side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true I little respect women or girls who are loquacious either
in boasting the triumphs, or bemoaning the mortifications, of feelings.
But as to you, Paulina, speak, for I earnestly wish to hear you. Tell
me all it will give you pleasure or relief to tell: I ask no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you care for me, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do, Paulina.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I love you. I had an odd content in being with you even when I was
a little, troublesome, disobedient girl; it was charming to me then to
lavish on you my naughtiness and whims. Now you are acceptable to me,
and I like to talk with and trust you. So listen, Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) settled herself, resting against my arm--resting gently, not
with honest Mistress Fanshawe's fatiguing and selfish weight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A few minutes since you asked whether we had not heard from Graham
during our absence, and I said there were two letters for papa on
business; this was true, but I did not tell you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You evaded?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I shuffled and equivocated, you know. However, I am going to speak the
truth now; it is getting darker; one can talk at one's ease. Papa often
lets me open the letter-bag and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) out the contents. One morning,
about three weeks ago, you don't know how surprised I was to find,
amongst a dozen letters for M. de Bassompierre, a note addressed to
Miss de Bassompierre. I spied it at once, amidst all the rest; the
handwriting was not strange; it attracted me directly. I was going to
say, ``Papa, here is another letter from Dr. Bretton;' but the <div class="bookquote">``Miss'
struck me mute. I actually never received a letter from a gentleman
before. Ought I to have shown it to papa, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) open it and read
it first? I could not for my life, Lucy. I know so well papa's ideas
about me: he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) forgets my age; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) thinks I am a mere school-girl; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is
not aware that other people see I am grown up as tall as I shall be;
so, with a curious mixture of feelings, some of them self-reproachful,
and some so fluttering and strong, I cannot describe them, I gave papa
his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) twelve letters--his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) herd of possessions--and kept back my one, my
ewe-lamb. It lay in my lap during breakfast, looking up at me with an
inexplicable meaning, making me feel myself a thing double-existent--a
child to that dear papa, but no more a child to myself. After breakfast
I carried my letter up-stairs, and having secured myself by turning the
key in the door, I began to study the outside of my treasure: it was
some minutes before I could get over the direction and penetrate the
seal; one does not take a strong place of this kind by instant
storm--one sits down awhile before it, as beleaguers say. Graham's hand
is like himself, Lucy, and so is his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) seal--all clear, firm, and
rounded--no slovenly splash of wax--a full, solid, steady drop--a
distinct impress; no pointed turns harshly pricking the optic nerve,
but a clean, mellow, pleasant manuscript, that soothes you as you read.
It is like his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) face--just like the chiselling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) features: do you
know his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) autograph?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen it: go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``The seal was too beautiful to be broken, so I cut it round with my
scissors. On the point of reading the letter at last, I once more drew
back voluntarily; it was too soon yet to drink that draught--the
sparkle in the cup was so beautiful--I would watch it yet a minute.
Then I remembered all at once that I had not said my prayers that
morning. Having heard papa go down to breakfast a little earlier than
usual, I had been afraid of keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) waiting, and had hastened to
join him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) as soon as dressed, thinking no harm to put off prayers till
afterwards. Some people would say I ought to have served God first and
then man; but I don't think heaven could be jealous of anything I might
do for papa. I believe I am superstitious. A voice seemed now to say
that another feeling than filial affection was in question--to urge me
to pray before I dared to read what I so longed to read--to deny myself
yet a moment, and remember first a great duty. I have had these
impulses ever since I can remember. I put the letter down and said my
prayers, adding, at the end, a strong entreaty that whatever happened,
I might not be tempted or led to cause papa any sorrow, and might
never, in caring for others, neglect him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). The very thought of such a
possibility, so pierced my heart that it made me cry. But still, Lucy,
I felt that in time papa would have to be taught the truth, managed,
and induced to hear reason.

<p/>``I read the letter. Lucy, life is said to be all disappointment. _I_
was not disappointed. Ere I read, and while I read, my heart did more
than throb--it trembled fast--every quiver seemed like the pant of an
animal athirst, laid down at a well and drinking; and the well proved
quite full, gloriously clear; it rose up munificently of its own
impulse; I saw the sun through its gush, and not a mote, Lucy, no moss,
no insect, no atom in the thrice-refined golden gurgle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Life,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``is said to be full of pain to some. I have read
biographies where the wayfarer seemed to journey on from suffering to
suffering; where Hope flew before him (<font color='blue'><b>pant</b></font>) fast, never alighting so near, or
lingering so long, as to give his (<font color='blue'><b>pant</b></font>) hand a chance of one realizing grasp.
I have read of those who sowed in tears, and whose harvest, so far from
being reaped in joy, perished by untimely blight, or was borne off by
sudden whirlwind; and, alas! some of these met the winter with empty
garners, and died of utter want in the darkest and coldest of the year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it their fault, Paulina, that they of whom you speak thus died?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always their fault. Some of them were good endeavouring people. I
am not endeavouring, nor actively good, yet God has caused me to grow
in sun, due moisture, and safe protection, sheltered, fostered, taught,
by my dear father; and now--now--another comes. Graham loves me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For some minutes we both paused on this climax.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does your father know?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Graham spoke with deep respect of papa, but implied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) dared not
approach that quarter as yet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) must first prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) worth: he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) added
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) must have some light respecting myself and my own feelings ere
he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) ventured to risk a step in the matter elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you reply?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I replied briefly, but I did not repulse him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). Yet I almost trembled
for fear of making the answer too cordial: Graham's tastes are so
fastidious. I wrote it three times--chastening and subduing the phrases
at every rescript; at last, having confected it till it seemed to me to
resemble a morsel of ice flavoured with ever so slight a zest of fruit
or sugar, I ventured to seal and despatch it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent, Paulina! Your instinct is fine; you understand Dr. Bretton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how must I manage about papa? There I am still in pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not manage at all. Wait now. Only maintain no further

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Time will show. Wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Bretton wrote one other letter, deeply grateful for my calm, brief
note; but I anticipated your advice, by saying, that while my
sentiments continued the same, I could not, without my father's
knowledge, write again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You acted as you ought to have done; so Dr. Bretton will feel: it will
increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) pride in you, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) love for you, if either be capable of
increase. Paulina, that gentle hoar-frost of yours, surrounding so much
pure, fine flame, is a priceless privilege of nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I feel Graham's disposition,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I feel that no

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is perfectly proved that you comprehend him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), and then--whatever Dr.
Bretton's disposition, were he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) one who expected to be more nearly
met--you would still act truthfully, openly, tenderly, with your
father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, I trust I shall thus act always. Oh, it will be pain to wake
papa from his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) dream, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) I am no more a little girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Be in no hurry to do so, Paulina. Leave the revelation to Time and
your kind Fate. I also have noticed the gentleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) cares for
you: doubt not she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) will benignantly order the circumstances, and fitly
appoint the hour. Yes: I have thought over your life just as you have
yourself thought it over; I have made comparisons like those to which
you adverted. We know not the future, but the past has been propitious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As a child I feared for you; nothing that has life was ever more
susceptible than your nature in infancy: under harshness or neglect,
neither your outward nor your inward self would have ripened to what
they now are. Much pain, much fear, much struggle, would have troubled
the very lines of your features, broken their regularity, would have
harassed your nerves into the fever of habitual irritation; you would
have lost in health and cheerfulness, in grace and sweetness.
Providence has protected and cultured you, not only for your own sake,
but I believe for Graham's. His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) star, too, was fortunate: to develop
fully the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) nature, a companion like you was needed: there
you are, ready. You must be united. I knew it the first day I saw you
together at La Terrasse. In all that mutually concerns you and Graham
there seems to me promise, plan, harmony. I do not think the sunny
youth of either will prove the forerunner of stormy age. I think it is
deemed good that you two should live in peace and be happy--not as
angels, but as few are happy amongst mortals. Some lives _are_ thus
blessed: it is God's will: it is the attesting trace and lingering
evidence of Eden. Other lives run from the first another course. Other
travellers encounter weather fitful and gusty, wild and
variable--breast adverse winds, are belated and overtaken by the early
closing winter night. Neither can this happen without the sanction of
God; and I know that, amidst His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) boundless works, is somewhere stored
the secret of this last fate's justice: I know that His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) treasures
contain the proof as the promise of its mercy.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXIII.

<p/>M. PAUL KEEPS HIS (<font color='blue'><b>PAUL</b></font>) PROMISE.


<p/>On the first of May, we had all--i.e. the twenty boarders and the four
teachers--notice to rise at five o'clock of the morning, to be dressed
and ready by six, to put ourselves under the command of M. le
Professeur Emanuel, who was to head our march forth from Villette, for
it was on this day he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) proposed to fulfil his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) promise of taking us to
breakfast in the country. I, indeed, as the reader may perhaps
remember, had not had the honour of an invitation when this excursion
was first projected--rather the contrary; but on my now making allusion
to this fact, and wishing to know how it was to be, my ear received a
pull, of which I did not venture to challenge the repetition by
raising, further difficulties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Je vous conseille de vous faire prier,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>said M. Emanuel, imperially
menacing the other ear. One Napoleonic compliment, however, was enough,
so I made up my mind to be of the party.

<p/>The morning broke calm as summer, with singing of birds in the garden,
and a light dew-mist that promised heat. We all said it would be warm,
and we all felt pleasure in folding away heavy garments, and in
assuming the attire suiting a sunny season. The clean fresh print
dress, and the light straw bonnet, each made and trimmed as the French
workwoman alone can make and trim, so as to unite the utterly
unpretending with the perfectly becoming, was the rule of costume.
Nobody flaunted in faded silk; nobody wore a second-hand best article.

<p/>At six the bell rang merrily, and we poured down the staircase, through
the carré, along the corridor, into the vestibule. There stood our
Professor, wearing, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) savage-looking paletôt and severe
bonnet-grec, but a young-looking belted blouse and cheerful straw hat.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had for us all the kindest good-morrow, and most of us for him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had a
thanksgiving smile. We were marshalled in order and soon started.

<p/>The streets were yet quiet, and the boulevards were fresh and peaceful
as fields. I believe we were very happy as we walked along. This chief
of ours had the secret of giving a certain impetus to happiness when he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
would; just as, in an opposite mood, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) could give a thrill to fear.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) did not lead nor follow us, but walked along the line, giving a word
to every one, talking much to his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) favourites, and not wholly neglecting
even those he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) disliked. It was rather my wish, for a reason I had, to
keep slightly aloof from notice, and being paired with Ginevra
Fanshawe, bearing on my arm the dear pressure of that angel's not
unsubstantial limb---LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) continued in excellent case, and I can assure
the reader it was no trifling business to bear the burden of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
loveliness; many a time in the course of that warm day I wished to
goodness there had been less of the charming commodity-RRB---however,
having her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), as I said, I tried to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) useful by interposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
always between myself and M. Paul, shifting my place, according as I
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) coming up to the right hand or the left. My private motive
for this manoeuvre might be traced to the circumstance of the new print
dress I wore, being pink in colour--a fact which, under our present
convoy, made me feel something as I have felt, when, clad in a shawl
with a red border, necessitated to traverse a meadow where pastured a
bull.

<p/>For awhile, the shifting system, together with some modifications in
the arrangement of a black silk scarf, answered my purpose; but,
by-and-by, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) found out, that whether he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came to this side or to that,
Miss Fanshawe was still his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) neighbour. The course of acquaintance
between Ginevra and him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had never run so smooth that his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) temper did not
undergo a certain crisping process whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) English
accent: nothing in their dispositions fitted; they jarred if they came
in contact; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) empty and affected; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) deemed him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bearish,
meddling, repellent.

<p/>At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) place for about the sixth time,
finding still the same untoward result to the experiment--he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
head forward, settled his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes on mine, and demanded with impatience,
<div class="bookquote">``Qu'est-ce que c'est? Vous me jouez des tours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The words were hardly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mouth, however, ere, with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
customary quickness, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seized the root of this proceeding: in vain I
shook out the long fringe, and spread forth the broad end of my scarf.
<div class="bookquote">``A-h-h! c'est la robe rose!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>broke from his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips, affecting me very
much like the sudden and irate low of some lord of the meadow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only cotton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I alleged, hurriedly; <div class="bookquote">``and cheaper, and washes
better than any other colour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Et Mademoiselle Lucy est coquette comme dix Parisiennes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) answered.
<div class="bookquote">``A-t-on jamais vu une Anglaise pareille. Regardez plutôt son chapeau,
et ses gants, et ses brodequins!''  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>These articles of dress were just
like what my companions wore; certainly not one whit smarter--perhaps
rather plainer than most--but Monsieur had now got hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) text,
and I began to chafe under the expected sermon. It went off, however,
as mildly as the menace of a storm sometimes passes on a summer day. I
got but one flash of sheet lightning in the shape of a single bantering
smile from his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) eyes; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Courage!--à vrai dire je ne
suis pas fâché, peut-être même suis je content qu'on s`est fait si
belle pour ma petite fête.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais ma robe n'est pas belle, Monsieur--elle n'est que propre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``J'aime la propreté,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>). In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) was not to be dissatisfied;
the sun of good humour was to triumph on this auspicious morning; it
consumed scudding clouds ere they sullied its disk.

<p/>And now we were in the country, amongst what they called <div class="bookquote">``les bois et
les petits sentiers.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>These woods and lanes a month later would offer
but a dusty and doubtful seclusion: now, however, in their May
greenness and morning repose, they looked very pleasant.

<p/>We reached a certain well, planted round, in the taste of Labassecour,
with an orderly circle of lime-trees: here a halt was called; on the
green swell of ground surrounding this well, we were ordered to be
seated, Monsieur taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) place in our midst, and suffering us to
gather in a knot round him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>). Those who liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) more than they feared,
came close, and these were chiefly little ones; those who feared more
than they liked, kept somewhat aloof; those in whom much affection had
given, even to what remained of fear, a pleasurable zest, observed the
greatest distance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) began to tell us a story. Well could he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) narrate: in such a diction
as children love, and learned men emulate; a diction simple in its
strength, and strong in its simplicity. There were beautiful touches in
that little tale; sweet glimpses of feeling and hues of description
that, while I listened, sunk into my mind, and since have never faded.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) tinted a twilight scene--I hold it in memory still--such a picture I
have never looked on from artist's pencil.

<p/>I have said, that, for myself, I had no impromptu faculty; and perhaps
that very deficiency made me marvel the more at one who possessed it in
perfection. M. Emanuel was not a man to write books; but I have heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lavish, with careless, unconscious prodigality, such mental wealth
as books seldom boast; his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) mind was indeed my library, and whenever it
was opened to me, I entered bliss. Intellectually imperfect as I was, I
could read little; there were few bound and printed volumes that did
not weary me--whose perusal did not fag and blind--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) tomes of
thought were collyrium to the spirit's eyes; over their contents,
inward sight grew clear and strong. I used to think what a delight it
would be for one who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) loved himself, to gather
and store up those handfuls of gold-dust, so recklessly flung to
heaven's reckless winds.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) story done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) approached the little knoll where I and Ginevra sat
apart. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) usual mode of demanding an opinion -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had not reticence
to wait till it was voluntarily offered-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``Were you
interested?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>According to my wonted undemonstrative fashion, I simply
answered--<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet I could not write that down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, Monsieur?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate the mechanical labour; I hate to stoop and sit still. I could
dictate it, though, with pleasure, to an amanuensis who suited me.
Would Mademoiselle Lucy write for me if I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur would be too quick; he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would urge me, and be angry if my pen
did not keep pace with his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) lips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try some day; let us see the monster I can make of myself under the
circumstances. But just now, there is no question of dictation; I mean
to make you useful in another office. Do you see yonder farm-house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surrounded with trees? Yes.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There we are to breakfast; and while the good fermière makes the café
au lait in a caldron, you and five others, whom I shall select, will
spread with butter half a hundred rolls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Having formed his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) troop into line once more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) marched us straight on
the farm, which, on seeing our force, surrendered without capitulation.

<p/>Clean knives and plates, and fresh butter being provided, half-a-dozen
of us, chosen by our Professor, set to work under his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) directions, to
prepare for breakfast a huge basket of rolls, with which the baker had
been ordered to provision the farm, in anticipation of our coming.
Coffee and chocolate were already made hot; cream and new-laid eggs
were added to the treat, and M. Emanuel, always generous, would have
given a large order for <div class="bookquote">``jambon''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``confitures''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>in addition, but that
some of us, who presumed perhaps upon our influence, insisted that it
would be a most reckless waste of victual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) railed at us for our
pains, terming us <div class="bookquote">``des ménagères avares;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but we let him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) talk, and
managed the economy of the repast our own way.

<p/>With what a pleasant countenance he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) stood on the farm-kitchen hearth
looking on! He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was a man whom it made happy to see others happy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
liked to have movement, animation, abundance and enjoyment round him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>).
We asked where he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would sit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) told us, we knew well he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was our slave,
and we his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) tyrants, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) dared not so much as choose a chair
without our leave; so we set him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) the farmer's great chair at the head
of the long table, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) into it.

<p/>Well might we like him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) passions and hurricanes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
could be so benignant and docile at times, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was just now. Indeed,
at the worst, it was only his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) nerves that were irritable, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
temper that was radically bad; soothe, comprehend, comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
was a lamb; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would not harm a fly. Only to the very stupid, perverse,
or unsympathizing, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) in the slightest degree dangerous.

<p/>Mindful always of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) religion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) made the youngest of the party say a
little prayer before we began breakfast, crossing himself as devotedly
as a woman. I had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) pray before, or make that pious sign;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) did it so simply, with such child-like faith, I could not help
smiling pleasurably as I watched; his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) eyes met my smile; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) just
stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) kind hand, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Donnez-moi la main! I see we
worship the same God, in the same spirit, though by different rites.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Most of M. Emanuel's brother Professors were emancipated free-thinkers,
infidels, atheists; and many of them men whose lives would not bear
scrutiny; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was more like a knight of old, religious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) way, and
of spotless fame. Innocent childhood, beautiful youth were safe at his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had vivid passions, keen feelings, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) pure honour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
artless piety were the strong charm that kept the lions couchant.

<p/>That breakfast was a merry meal, and the merriment was not mere vacant
clatter: M. Paul originated, led, controlled and heightened it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
social, lively temper played unfettered and unclouded; surrounded only
by women and children there was nothing to cross and thwart him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own way, and a pleasant way it was.

<p/>The meal over, the party were free to run and play in the meadows; a
few stayed to help the farmer's wife to put away her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) earthenware. M.
Paul called me from among these to come out and sit near him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) under a
tree--whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could view the troop gambolling, over a wide
pasture--and read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cigar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat on a rustic
bench, and I at the tree-root. While I read -LRB-a pocket-classic--a
Corneille--I did not like it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did, finding therein beauties I
never could be brought to perceive-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) listened with a sweetness of
calm the more impressive from the impetuosity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) general nature;
the deepest happiness filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) blue eye and smoothed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) broad
forehead. I, too, was happy--happy with the bright day, happier with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) presence, happiest with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) kindness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked, by-and-by, if I would not rather run to my companions than
sit there? I said, no; I felt content to be where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked
whether, if I were his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sister, I should always be content to stay with
a brother such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). I said, I believed I should; and I felt it.
Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) inquired whether, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) were to leave Villette, and go far
away, I should be sorry; and I dropped Corneille, and made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Petite soeur,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``how long could you remember me if we were
separated?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, Monsieur, I can never tell, because I do not know how long it
will be before I shall cease to remember everything earthly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were to go beyond seas for two--three--five years, should you
welcome me on my return?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, how could I live in the interval?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pourtant j'ai été pour vous bien dur, bien exigeant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hid my face with the book, for it was covered with tears. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
why he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) talked so; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would talk so no more, and cheered me
again with the kindest encouragement. Still, the gentleness with which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) treated me during the rest of the day, went somehow to my heart. It
was too tender. It was mournful. I would rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been abrupt,
whimsical, and irate as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wont.

<p/>When hot noon arrived--for the day turned out as we had anticipated,
glowing as June--our shepherd collected his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) sheep from the pasture, and
proceeded to lead us all softly home. But we had a whole league to
walk, thus far from Villette was the farm where he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) had breakfasted; the
children, especially, were tired with their play; the spirits of most
flagged at the prospect of this mid-day walk over chaussées flinty,
glaring, and dusty. This state of things had been foreseen and provided
for. Just beyond the boundary of the farm we met two spacious vehicles
coming to fetch us--such conveyances as are hired out purposely for the
accommodation of school-parties; here, with good management, room was
found for all, and in another hour M. Paul made safe consignment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
charge at the Rue Fossette. It had been a pleasant day: it would have
been perfect, but for the breathing of melancholy which had dimmed its
sunshine a moment.

<p/>That tarnish was renewed the same evening.

<p/>Just about sunset, I saw M. Emanuel come out of the front-door,
accompanied by Madame Beck. They paced the centre-alley for nearly an
hour, talking earnestly: he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)--looking grave, yet restless; she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)--wearing
an amazed, expostulatory, dissuasive air.

<p/>I wondered what was under discussion; and when Madame Beck re-entered
the house as it darkened, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) kinsman Paul yet lingering in the
garden, I said to myself--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) called me `petite soeur' this morning. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) were really my brother, how I should like to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) just now, and
ask what it is that presses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) mind. See how he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) leans against that
tree, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) arms crossed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) brow bent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) wants consolation, I
know: Madame does not console: she (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) only remonstrates. What now--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Starting from quiescence to action, M. Paul came striding erect and
quick down the garden. The carré doors were yet open: I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
probably going to water the orange-trees in the tubs, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
occasional custom; on reaching the court, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took an abrupt
turn and made for the berceau and the first-classe glass door. There,
in that first classe I was, thence I had been watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); but there I
could not find courage to await his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) approach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had turned so
suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) strode so fast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) looked so strange; the coward within me
grew pale, shrank and--not waiting to listen to reason, and hearing the
shrubs crush and the gravel crunch to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) advance--she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was gone on the
wings of panic.

<p/>Nor did I pause till I had taken sanctuary in the oratory, now empty.
Listening there with beating pulses, and an unaccountable, undefined
apprehension, I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pass through all the schoolrooms, clashing
the doors impatiently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went; I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) invade the refectory
which the <div class="bookquote">``lecture pieuse''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was now holding under hallowed constraint; I
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pronounce these words--<div class="bookquote">``Où est Mademoiselle Lucie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And just as, summoning my courage, I was preparing to go down and do
what, after all, I most wished to do in the world--viz., meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)--the
wiry voice of St. Pierre replied glibly and falsely, <div class="bookquote">``Elle est au lit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle/Pierre/Mademoiselle St. Pierre</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) passed, with the stamp of vexation, into the corridor. There
Madame Beck met, captured, chid, convoyed to the street-door, and
finally dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>).

<p/>As that street-door closed, a sudden amazement at my own perverse
proceeding struck like a blow upon me. I felt from the first it was me
he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) wanted--me he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) was seeking--and had not I wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) too? What, then,
had carried me away? What had rapt me beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) reach? He (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) had
something to tell: he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) was going to tell me that something: my ear
strained its nerve to hear it, and I had made the confidence
impossible. Yearning to listen and console, while I thought audience
and solace beyond hope's reach--no sooner did opportunity suddenly and
fully arrive, than I evaded it as I would have evaded the levelled
shaft of mortality.

<p/>Well, my insane inconsistency had its reward. Instead of the comfort,
the certain satisfaction, I might have won--could I but have put
choking panic down, and stood firm two minutes--here was dead blank,
dark doubt, and drear suspense.

<p/>I took my wages to my pillow, and passed the night counting them.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV.

<p/>MALEVOLA.


<p/>Madame Beck called me on Thursday afternoon, and asked whether I had
any occupation to hinder me from going into town and executing some
little commissions for her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) at the shops.

<p/>Being disengaged, and placing myself at her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) service, I was presently
furnished with a list of the wools, silks, embroidering thread,
etcetera, wanted in the pupils' work, and having equipped myself in a
manner suiting the threatening aspect of a cloudy and sultry day, I was
just drawing the spring-bolt of the street-door, in act to issue forth,
when Madame's voice again summoned me to the salle-à-manger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon, Meess Lucie!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), in the seeming haste of an impromptu
thought, <div class="bookquote">``I have just recollected one more errand for you, if your
good-nature will not deem itself over-burdened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course I <div class="bookquote">``confounded myself''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in asseverations to the contrary; and
Madame, running into the little salon, brought thence a pretty basket,
filled with fine hothouse fruit, rosy, perfect, and tempting, reposing
amongst the dark green, wax-like leaves, and pale yellow stars of, I
know not what, exotic plant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is not heavy, and will not shame your neat
toilette, as if it were a household, servant-like detail. Do me the
favour to leave this little basket at the house of Madame Walravens,
with my felicitations on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elle</b></font>) fête. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elle</b></font>) lives down in the old town,
Numéro 3, Rue des Mages. I fear you will find the walk rather long, but
you have the whole afternoon before you, and do not hurry; if you are
not back in time for dinner, I will order a portion to be saved, or
Goton, with whom you are a favourite, will have pleasure in tossing up
some trifle, for your especial benefit. You shall not be forgotten, ma
bonne Meess. And oh! please!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-calling me back once more-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``be sure to
insist on seeing Madame Walravens herself, and giving the basket into
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own hands, in order that there may be no mistake, for she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is rather
a punctilious personage. Adieu! Au revoir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>And at last I got away. The shop commissions took some time to execute,
that choosing and matching of silks and wools being always a tedious
business, but at last I got through my list. The patterns for the
slippers, the bell-ropes, the cabas were selected--the slides and
tassels for the purses chosen--the whole <div class="bookquote">``tripotage,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in short, was off
my mind; nothing but the fruit and the felicitations remained to be
attended to.

<p/>I rather liked the prospect of a long walk, deep into the old and grim
Basse-Ville; and I liked it no worse because the evening sky, over the
city, was settling into a mass of black-blue metal, heated at the rim,
and inflaming slowly to a heavy red.

<p/>I fear a high wind, because storm demands that exertion of strength and
use of action I always yield with pain; but the sullen down-fall, the
thick snow-descent, or dark rush of rain, ask only resignation--the
quiet abandonment of garments and person to be, drenched. In return, it
sweeps a great capital clean before you; it makes you a quiet path
through broad, grand streets; it petrifies a living city as if by
eastern enchantment; it transforms a Villette into a Tadmor. Let, then,
the rains fall, and the floods descend--only I must first get rid of
this basket of fruit.

<p/>An unknown clock from an unknown tower -LRB-Jean Baptiste's voice was now
too distant to be audible-RRB- was tolling the third quarter past five,
when I reached that street and house whereof Madame Beck had given me
the address. It was no street at all; it seemed rather to be part of a
square: it was quiet, grass grew between the broad grey flags, the
houses were large and looked very old--behind them rose the appearance
of trees, indicating gardens at the back. Antiquity brooded above this
region, business was banished thence. Rich men had once possessed this
quarter, and once grandeur had made her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seat here. That church, whose
dark, half-ruinous turrets overlooked the square, was the venerable and
formerly opulent shrine of the Magi. But wealth and greatness had long
since stretched their gilded pinions and fled hence, leaving these
their ancient nests, perhaps to house Penury for a time, or perhaps to
stand cold and empty, mouldering untenanted in the course of winters.

<p/>As I crossed this deserted <div class="bookquote">``place,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>on whose pavement drops almost as
large as a five-franc piece were now slowly darkening, I saw, in its
whole expanse, no symptom or evidence of life, except what was given in
the figure of an infirm old priest, who went past, bending and propped
on a staff--the type of eld and decay.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had issued from the very house to which I was directed; and when I
paused before the door just closed after him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), and rang the bell, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
turned to look at me. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) soon avert his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) gaze; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
thought me, with my basket of summer fruit, and my lack of the dignity
age confers, an incongruous figure in such a scene. I know, had a young
ruddy-faced bonne opened the door to admit me, I should have thought
such a one little in harmony with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dwelling; but, when I found
myself confronted by a very old woman, wearing a very antique peasant
costume, a cap alike hideous and costly, with long flaps of native
lace, a petticoat and jacket of cloth, and sabots more like little
boats than shoes, it seemed all right, and soothingly in character.

<p/>The expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face was not quite so soothing as the cut of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
costume; anything more cantankerous I have seldom seen; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would
scarcely reply to my inquiry after Madame Walravens; I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
would have snatched the basket of fruit from my hand, had not the old
priest, hobbling up, checked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and himself lent an ear to the
message with which I was charged.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) apparent deafness rendered it a little difficult to make him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) fully
understand that I must see Madame Walravens, and consign the fruit into
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own hands. At last, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walravens</b></font>) comprehended the fact that such
were my orders, and that duty enjoined their literal fulfilment.
Addressing the aged bonne, not in French, but in the aboriginal tongue
of Labassecour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walravens</b></font>) persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), at last, to let me cross the
inhospitable threshold, and himself escorting me up-stairs, I was
ushered into a sort of salon, and there left.

<p/>The room was large, and had a fine old ceiling, and almost church-like
windows of coloured-glass; but it was desolate, and in the shadow of a
coming storm, looked strangely lowering. Within--opened a smaller room;
there, however, the blind of the single casement was closed; through
the deep gloom few details of furniture were apparent. These few I
amused myself by puzzling to make out; and, in particular, I was
attracted by the outline of a picture on the wall.

<p/>By-and-by the picture seemed to give way: to my bewilderment, it shook,
it sunk, it rolled back into nothing; its vanishing left an opening
arched, leading into an arched passage, with a mystic winding stair;
both passage and stair were of cold stone, uncarpeted and unpainted.
Down this donjon stair descended a tap, tap, like a stick; soon there
fell on the steps a shadow, and last of all, I was aware of a substance.

<p/>Yet, was it actual substance, this appearance approaching me? this
obstruction, partially darkening the arch?

<p/>It drew near, and I saw it well. I began to comprehend where I was.
Well might this old square be named quarter of the Magi--well might the
three towers, overlooking it, own for godfathers three mystic sages of
a dead and dark art. Hoar enchantment here prevailed; a spell had
opened for me elf-land--that cell-like room, that vanishing picture,
that arch and passage, and stair of stone, were all parts of a fairy
tale. Distincter even than these scenic details stood the chief
figure--Cunegonde, the sorceress! Malevola, the evil fairy. How was she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>)?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) might be three feet high, but she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had no shape; her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) skinny hands
rested upon each other, and pressed the gold knob of a wand-like ivory
staff. Her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) face was large, set, not upon her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) shoulders, but before her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>)
breast; she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) seemed to have no neck; I should have said there were a
hundred years in her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) features, and more perhaps in her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) eyes--her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>)
malign, unfriendly eyes, with thick grey brows above, and livid lids
all round. How severely they viewed me, with a sort of dull displeasure!

<p/>This being wore a gown of brocade, dyed bright blue, full-tinted as the
gentianella flower, and covered with satin foliage in a large pattern;
over the gown a costly shawl, gorgeously bordered, and so large for
her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>), that its many-coloured fringe swept the floor. But her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) chief
points were her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) jewels: she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had long, clear earrings, blazing with a
lustre which could not be borrowed or false; she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had rings on her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>)
skeleton hands, with thick gold hoops, and stones--purple, green, and
blood-red. Hunchbacked, dwarfish, and doting, she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was adorned like a
barbarian queen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Que me voulez-vous?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>), hoarsely, with the voice rather of male
than of female old age; and, indeed, a silver beard bristled her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) chin.

<p/>I delivered my basket and my message.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, it was well worth while,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Return to Madame Beck,
and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) I can buy fruit when I want it, et quant à ses
félicitations, je m`en moque!''  (<font color='red'><b>this dame</b></font>)</div>And this courteous dame turned her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) back.

<p/>Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) turned, a peal of thunder broke, and a flash of lightning
blazed broad over salon and boudoir. The tale of magic seemed to
proceed with due accompaniment of the elements. The wanderer, decoyed
into the enchanted castle, heard rising, outside, the spell-wakened
tempest.

<p/>What, in all this, was I to think of Madame Beck? She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) owned strange
acquaintance; she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) offered messages and gifts at an unique shrine, and
inauspicious seemed the bearing of the uncouth thing she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) worshipped.
There went that sullen Sidonia, tottering and trembling like palsy
incarnate, tapping her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) ivory staff on the mosaic parquet, and muttering
venomously as she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) vanished.

<p/>Down washed the rain, deep lowered the welkin; the clouds, ruddy a
while ago, had now, through all their blackness, turned deadly pale, as
if in terror. Notwithstanding my late boast about not fearing a shower,
I hardly liked to go out under this waterspout. Then the gleams of
lightning were very fierce, the thunder crashed very near; this storm
had gathered immediately above Villette; it seemed to have burst at the
zenith; it rushed down prone; the forked, slant bolts pierced athwart
vertical torrents; red zigzags interlaced a descent blanched as white
metal: and all broke from a sky heavily black in its swollen abundance.

<p/>Leaving Madame Walravens' inhospitable salon, I betook myself to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
cold staircase; there was a seat on the landing--there I waited.
Somebody came gliding along the gallery just above; it was the old
priest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed Mademoiselle shall not sit there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It would
displeasure our benefactor if he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) knew a stranger was so treated in this
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) begged me so earnestly to return to the salon, that, without
discourtesy, I could not but comply. The smaller room was better
furnished and more habitable than the larger; thither he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) introduced me.
Partially withdrawing the blind, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) disclosed what seemed more like an
oratory than a boudoir, a very solemn little chamber, looking as if it
were a place rather dedicated to relics and remembrance, than designed
for present use and comfort.

<p/>The good father sat down, as if to keep me company; but instead of
conversing, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took out a book, fastened on the page his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes, and
employed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lips in whispering--what sounded like a prayer or litany.
A yellow electric light from the sky gilded his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bald head; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) figure
remained in shade--deep and purple; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat still as sculpture; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
seemed to forget me for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) prayers; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only looked up when a fiercer
bolt, or a harsher, closer rattle told of nearing danger; even then, it
was not in fear, but in seeming awe, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes. I too was
awe-struck; being, however, under no pressure of slavish terror, my
thoughts and observations were free.

<p/>To speak truth, I was beginning to fancy that the old priest resembled
that Père Silas, before whom I had kneeled in the church of the
Béguinage. The idea was vague, for I had seen my confessor only in dusk
and in profile, yet still I seemed to trace a likeness: I thought also
I recognized the voice. While I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) betrayed, by one lifted
look, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) felt my scrutiny; I turned to note the room; that too had
its half mystic interest.

<p/>Beside a cross of curiously carved old ivory, yellow with time, and
sloped above a dark-red _prie-dieu_, furnished duly, with rich missal
and ebon rosary--hung the picture whose dim outline had drawn my eyes
before--the picture which moved, fell away with the wall and let in
phantoms. Imperfectly seen, I had taken it for a Madonna; revealed by
clearer light, it proved to be a woman's portrait in a nun's dress. The
face, though not beautiful, was pleasing; pale, young, and shaded with
the dejection of grief or ill health. I say again it was not beautiful;
it was not even intellectual; its very amiability was the amiability of
a weak frame, inactive passions, acquiescent habits: yet I looked long
at that picture, and could not choose but look.

<p/>The old priest, who at first had seemed to me so deaf and infirm, must
yet have retained his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) faculties in tolerable preservation; absorbed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) book as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) appeared, without once lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) head, or, as far as I
knew, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) perceived the point towards which my
attention was drawn, and, in a slow distinct voice, dropped, concerning
it, these four observations:--

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was much beloved.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gave herself to God.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) died young.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is still remembered, still wept.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By that aged lady, Madame Walravens?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, fancying that I had
discovered in the incurable grief of bereavement, a key to that same
aged lady's desperate ill-humour.

<p/>The father shook his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head with half a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``a grand-dame's affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) children's
children may be great, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sorrow for their loss, lively; but it is
only the affianced lover, to whom Fate, Faith, and Death have trebly
denied the bliss of union, who mourns what he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) has lost, as Justine
Marie is still mourned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought the father rather wished to be questioned, and therefore I
inquired who had lost and who still mourned <div class="bookquote">``Justine Marie.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I got, in
reply, quite a little romantic narrative, told not unimpressively, with
the accompaniment of the now subsiding storm. I am bound to say it
might have been made much more truly impressive, if there had been less
French, Rousseau-like sentimentalizing and wire-drawing; and rather
more healthful carelessness of effect. But the worthy father was
obviously a Frenchman born and bred -LRB-I became more and more persuaded
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) resemblance to my confessor-RRB---he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a true son of Rome; when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
did lift his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked at me out of their corners, with more and
sharper subtlety than, one would have thought, could survive the wear
and tear of seventy years. Yet, I believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a good old man.

<p/>The hero of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) tale was some former pupil of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), whom he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) now called
his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) benefactor, and who, it appears, had loved this pale Justine Marie,
the daughter of rich parents, at a time when his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) own worldly prospects
were such as to justify his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) aspiring to a well-dowered hand. The
pupil's father--once a rich banker--had failed, died, and left behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) only debts and destitution. The son was then forbidden to think of
Marie; especially that old witch of a grand-dame I had seen, Madame
Walravens, opposed the match with all the violence of a temper which
deformity made sometimes demoniac. The mild Marie had neither the
treachery to be false, nor the force to be quite staunch to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) first suitor, but, refusing to accept a second with a
heavier purse, withdrew to a convent, and there died in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) noviciate.

<p/>Lasting anguish, it seems, had taken possession of the faithful heart
which worshipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and the truth of that love and grief had been
shown in a manner which touched even me, as I listened.

<p/>Some years after Justine Marie's death, ruin had come on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) house too:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father, by nominal calling a jeweller, but who also dealt a good
deal on the Bourse, had been concerned in some financial transactions
which entailed exposure and ruinous fines. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died of grief for the
loss, and shame for the infamy. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old hunchbacked mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
bereaved wife were left penniless, and might have died too of want; but
their lost daughter's once-despised, yet most true-hearted suitor,
hearing of the condition of these ladies, came with singular
devotedness to the rescue. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took on their insolent pride the revenge
of the purest charity--housing, caring for, befriending them, so as no
son could have done it more tenderly and efficiently. The mother--on
the whole a good woman--died blessing him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); the strange, godless,
loveless, misanthrope grandmother lived still, entirely supported by
this self-sacrificing man. Her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>), who had been the bane of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life,
blighting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hope, and awarding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for love and domestic happiness,
long mourning and cheerless solitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treated with the respect a
good son might offer a kind mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to this house,
<div class="bookquote">``and,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>continued the priest, while genuine tears rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes,
<div class="bookquote">``here, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) shelters me, his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) old tutor, and Agnes, a superannuated
servant of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) father's family. To our sustenance, and to other
charities, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) devotes three-parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) income, keeping only
the fourth to provide himself with bread and the most modest
accommodations. By this arrangement he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) has rendered it impossible to
himself ever to marry: he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) has given himself to God and to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
angel-bride as much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were a priest, like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/>The father had wiped away his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tears before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uttered these last words,
and in pronouncing them, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for one instant raised his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes to mine. I
caught this glance, despite its veiled character; the momentary gleam
shot a meaning which struck me.

<p/>These Romanists are strange beings. Such a one among them--whom you
know no more than the last Inca of Peru, or the first Emperor of
China--knows you and all your concerns; and has his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) reasons for saying
to you so and so, when you simply thought the communication sprang
impromptu from the instant's impulse: his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) plan in bringing it about
that you shall come on such a day, to such a place, under such and such
circumstances, when the whole arrangement seems to your crude
apprehension the ordinance of chance, or the sequel of exigency. Madame
Beck's suddenly-recollected message and present, my artless embassy to
the Place of the Magi, the old priest accidentally descending the steps
and crossing the square, his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) interposition on my behalf with the bonne
who would have sent me away, his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) reappearance on the staircase, my
introduction to this room, the portrait, the narrative so affably
volunteered--all these little incidents, taken as they fell out, seemed
each independent of its successor; a handful of loose beads: but
threaded through by that quick-shot and crafty glance of a Jesuit-eye,
they dropped pendent in a long string, like that rosary on the
prie-dieu. Where lay the link of junction, where the little clasp of
this monastic necklace? I saw or felt union, but could not yet find the
spot, or detect the means of connection.

<p/>Perhaps the musing-fit into which I had by this time fallen, appeared
somewhat suspicious in its abstraction; he (<font color='blue'><b>successor</b></font>) gently interrupted:
<div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>successor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I trust you have not far to go through these
inundated streets?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than half a league.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You live--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the Rue Fossette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with animation-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``not at the pensionnat of Madame Beck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Donc''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>successor</b></font>) hands-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``donc, vous devez connaître mon noble
élève, mon Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Paul Emanuel, Professor of Literature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) and none other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A brief silence fell. The spring of junction seemed suddenly to have
become palpable; I felt it yield to pressure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it of M. Paul you have been speaking?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I presently inquired. <div class="bookquote">``Was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) your pupil and the benefactor of Madame Walravens?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and of Agnes, the old servant: and moreover, -LRB-with a certain
emphasis-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was and _is_ the lover, true, constant and eternal, of
that saint in heaven--Justine Marie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who, father, are _you?_''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued; and though I accentuated the
question, its utterance was well nigh superfluous; I was ere this quite
prepared for the answer which actually came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I, daughter, am Père Silas; that unworthy son of Holy Church whom you
once honoured with a noble and touching confidence, showing me the core
of a heart, and the inner shrine of a mind whereof, in solemn truth, I
coveted the direction, in behalf of the only true faith. Nor have I for
a day lost sight of you, nor for an hour failed to take in you a rooted
interest. Passed under the discipline of Rome, moulded by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) high
training, inoculated with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) salutary doctrines, inspired by the zeal
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) alone gives--I realize what then might be your spiritual rank, your
practical value; and I envy Heresy her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) prey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>This struck me as a special state of things--I half-realized myself in
that condition also; passed under discipline, moulded, trained,
inoculated, and so on. <div class="bookquote">``Not so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I, but I restrained
deprecation, and sat quietly enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose M. Paul does not live here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I resumed, pursuing a theme
which I thought more to the purpose than any wild renegade dreams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) only comes occasionally to worship his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) beloved saint, to make
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) confession to me, and to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) respects to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) calls his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
mother. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own lodging consists but of two rooms: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) has no servant,
and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) will not suffer Madame Walravens to dispose of those
splendid jewels with which you see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) adorned, and in which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) takes
a puerile pride as the ornaments of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) youth, and the last relics of
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) son the jeweller's wealth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How often,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>murmured I to myself, <div class="bookquote">``has this man, this M. Emanuel,
seemed to me to lack magnanimity in trifles, yet how great he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) is in
great things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I own I did not reckon amongst the proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) greatness, either the
act of confession, or the saint-worship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long is it since that lady died?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, looking at Justine
Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty years. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was somewhat older than M. Emanuel; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was then very
young, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) is not much beyond forty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) yet weep her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) heart will weep her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) always: the essence of Emanuel's nature
is--constancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was said with marked emphasis.

<p/>And now the sun broke out pallid and waterish; the rain yet fell, but
there was no more tempest: that hot firmament had cloven and poured out
its lightnings. A longer delay would scarce leave daylight for my
return, so I rose, thanked the father for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hospitality and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tale,
was benignantly answered by a <div class="bookquote">``pax vobiscum,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>which I made kindly
welcome, because it seemed uttered with a true benevolence; but I liked
less the mystic phrase accompanying it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daughter, you _shall_ be what you _shall_ be!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>an oracle that made me
shrug my shoulders as soon as I had got outside the door. Few of us
know what we are to come to certainly, but for all that had happened
yet, I had good hopes of living and dying a sober-minded Protestant:
there was a hollowness within, and a flourish around <div class="bookquote">``Holy Church''
 (<font color='red'><b>a Protestant</b></font>)</div>which tempted me but moderately. I went on my way pondering many
things. Whatever Romanism may be, there are good Romanists: this man,
Emanuel, seemed of the best; touched with superstition, influenced by
priestcraft, yet wondrous for fond faith, for pious devotion, for
sacrifice of self, for charity unbounded. It remained to see how Rome,
by her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) agents, handled such qualities; whether she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cherished them for
their own sake and for God's, or put them out to usury and made booty
of the interest.

<p/>By the time I reached home, it was sundown. Goton had kindly saved me a
portion of dinner, which indeed I needed. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) called me into the little
cabinet to partake of it, and there Madame Beck soon made her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
appearance, bringing me a glass of wine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>began she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), chuckling, <div class="bookquote">``and what sort of a reception did Madame
Walravens give you? Elle est drôle, n'est-ce pas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) what had passed, delivering verbatim the courteous message
with which I had been charged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh la singulière petite bossue!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>laughed she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Et figurez-vous qu'elle
me déteste, parcequ'elle me croit amoureuse de mon cousin Paul; ce
petit dévot qui n'ose pas bouger, à moins que son confesseur ne lui
donne la permission! Au reste''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went on-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wanted to marry

large a family already on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hands: Mère Walravens, Père Silas, Dame
Agnes, and a whole troop of nameless paupers. There never was a man
like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for laying on himself burdens greater than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can bear,
voluntarily incurring needless responsibilities. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) harbours a
romantic idea about some pale-faced Marie Justine--personnage assez

crotchets and eccentricities! But I hinder you from taking refreshment,

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXV

<p/>FRATERNITY.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oubliez les Professeurs.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Beck/Beck</b></font>)</div>So said Madame Beck. Madame Beck was a wise
woman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should not have uttered those words. To do so was a
mistake. That night she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should have left me calm--not excited,
indifferent, not interested, isolated in my own estimation and that of
others--not connected, even in idea, with this second person whom I was
to forget.

<p/>Forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)? Ah! they took a sage plan to make me forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)--the
wiseheads! They showed me how good he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) was; they made of my dear little
man a stainless little hero. And then they had prated about his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) manner
of loving. What means had I, before this day, of being certain whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) could love at all or not?

<p/>I had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) jealous, suspicious; I had seen about him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) certain
tendernesses, fitfulnesses--a softness which came like a warm air, and
a ruth which passed like early dew, dried in the heat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)
irritabilities: _this_ was all I had seen. And they, Père Silas and
Modeste Maria Beck -LRB-that these two wrought in concert I could not
doubt-RRB- opened up the adytum of his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) heart--showed me one grand love, the
child of this southern nature's youth, born so strong and perfect, that
it had laughed at Death himself, despised his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) mean rape of matter,
clung to immortal spirit, and in victory and faith, had watched beside
a tomb twenty years.

<p/>This had been done--not idly: this was not a mere hollow indulgence of
sentiment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) had proven his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) fidelity by the consecration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) best
energies to an unselfish purpose, and attested it by limitless personal
sacrifices: for those once dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) prized--he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) had laid down
vengeance, and taken up a cross.

<p/>Now, as for Justine Marie, I knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was as well as if I had seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was well enough; there were girls like her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) in Madame
Beck's school--phlegmatics--pale, slow, inert, but kind-natured,
neutral of evil, undistinguished for good.

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) wore angels' wings, I knew whose poet-fancy conferred them. If
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) forehead shone luminous with the reflex of a halo, I knew in the
fire of whose irids that circlet of holy flame had generation.

<p/>Was I, then, to be frightened by Justine Marie? Was the picture of a
pale dead nun to rise, an eternal barrier? And what of the charities
which absorbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) worldly goods? What of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) heart sworn to virginity?

<p/>Madame Beck--Père Silas--you should not have suggested these questions.
They were at once the deepest puzzle, the strongest obstruction, and
the keenest stimulus, I had ever felt. For a week of nights and days I
fell asleep--I dreamt, and I woke upon these two questions. In the
whole world there was no answer to them, except where one dark little
man stood, sat, walked, lectured, under the head-piece of a bandit
bonnet-grec, and within the girth of a sorry paletôt, much be-inked,
and no little adust.

<p/>After that visit to the Rue des Mages, I _did_ want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mages</b></font>) again. I
felt as if--knowing what I now knew--his (<font color='blue'><b>Mages</b></font>) countenance would offer a page
more lucid, more interesting than ever; I felt a longing to trace in it
the imprint of that primitive devotedness, the signs of that
half-knightly, half-saintly chivalry which the priest's narrative
imputed to his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had become my Christian hero: under that
character I wanted to view him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>).

<p/>Nor was opportunity slow to favour; my new impressions underwent her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
test the next day. Yes: I was granted an interview with my <div class="bookquote">``Christian
hero'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--an interview not very heroic, or sentimental, or biblical, but
lively enough in its way.

<p/>About three o'clock of the afternoon, the peace of the first
classe--safely established, as it seemed, under the serene sway of
Madame Beck, who, _in propriâ personâ_ was giving one of her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) orderly
and useful lessons--this peace, I say, suffered a sudden fracture by
the wild inburst of a paletôt.

<p/>Nobody at the moment was quieter than myself. Eased of responsibility
by Madame Beck's presence, soothed by her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) uniform tones, pleased and
edified with her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) clear exposition of the subject in hand -LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
taught well-RRB-, I sat bent over my desk, drawing--that is, copying an
elaborate line engraving, tediously working up my copy to the finish of
the original, for that was my practical notion of art; and, strange to
say, I took extreme pleasure in the labour, and could even produce
curiously finical Chinese facsimiles of steel or mezzotint
plates--things about as valuable as so many achievements in
worsted-work, but I thought pretty well of them in those days.

<p/>What was the matter? My drawing, my pencils, my precious copy, gathered
into one crushed-up handful, perished from before my sight; I myself
appeared to be shaken or emptied out of my chair, as a solitary and
withered nutmeg might be emptied out of a spice-box by an excited cook.
That chair and my desk, seized by the wild paletôt, one under each
sleeve, were borne afar; in a second, I followed the furniture; in two
minutes they and I were fixed in the centre of the grand salle--a vast
adjoining room, seldom used save for dancing and choral
singing-lessons--fixed with an emphasis which seemed to prohibit the
remotest hope of our ever being permitted to stir thence again.

<p/>Having partially collected my scared wits, I found myself in the
presence of two men, gentlemen, I suppose I should say--one dark, the
other light--one having a stiff, half-military air, and wearing a
braided surtout; the other partaking, in garb and bearing, more of the
careless aspect of the student or artist class: both flourishing in
full magnificence of moustaches, whiskers, and imperial. M. Emanuel
stood a little apart from these; his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) countenance and eyes expressed
strong choler; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) held forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) hand with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) tribune gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``your business is to prove to these gentlemen
that I am no liar. You will answer, to the best of your ability, such
questions as they shall put. You will also write on such theme as they
shall select. In their eyes, it appears, I hold the position of an
unprincipled impostor. I write essays; and, with deliberate forgery,
sign to them my pupils' names, and boast of them as their work. You
will disprove this charge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Grand ciel! Here was the show-trial, so long evaded, come on me like a
thunder-clap. These two fine, braided, mustachioed, sneering
personages, were none other than dandy professors of the
college--Messieurs Boissec and Rochemorte--a pair of cold-blooded fops
and pedants, sceptics, and scoffers. It seems that M. Paul had been
rashly exhibiting something I had written--something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had never once
praised, or even mentioned, in my hearing, and which I deemed
forgotten. The essay was not remarkable at all; it only _seemed_
remarkable, compared with the average productions of foreign
school-girls; in an English establishment it would have passed scarce
noticed. Messieurs Boissec and Rochemorte had thought proper to
question its genuineness, and insinuate a cheat; I was now to bear my
testimony to the truth, and to be put to the torture of their
examination.

<p/>A memorable scene ensued.

<p/>They began with classics. A dead blank. They went on to French history.
I hardly knew Mérovée from Pharamond. They tried me in various
`ologies, and still only got a shake of the head, and an unchanging <div class="bookquote">``Je
n'en sais rien.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>After an expressive pause, they proceeded to matters of general
information, broaching one or two subjects which I knew pretty well,
and on which I had often reflected. M. Emanuel, who had hitherto stood
looking on, dark as the winter-solstice, brightened up somewhat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
thought I should now show myself at least no fool.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) error. Though answers to the questions surged up fast,
my mind filling like a rising well, ideas were there, but not words. I
either _could_ not, or _would_ not speak--I am not sure which: partly,
I think, my nerves had got wrong, and partly my humour was crossed.

<p/>I heard one of my examiners--he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) of the braided surtout--whisper to his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
co-professor, <div class="bookquote">``Est-elle donc idiote?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought, <div class="bookquote">``an idiot she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is, and always will be, for such as
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I suffered--suffered cruelly; I saw the damps gather on M. Paul's
brow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eye spoke a passionate yet sad reproach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not
believe in my total lack of popular cleverness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought I _could_ be
prompt if I _would_.

<p/>At last, to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), the professors, and myself, I stammered out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, you had better let me go; you will get no good of me; as
you say, I am an idiot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I wish I could have spoken with calm and dignity, or I wish my sense
had sufficed to make me hold my tongue; that traitor tongue tripped,
faltered. Beholding the judges cast on M. Emanuel a hard look of
triumph, and hearing the distressed tremor of my own voice, out I burst
in a fit of choking tears. The emotion was far more of anger than
grief; had I been a man and strong, I could have challenged that pair
on the spot--but it _was_ emotion, and I would rather have been
scourged than betrayed it.

<p/>The incapables! Could they not see at once the crude hand of a novice
in that composition they called a forgery? The subject was classical.
When M. Paul dictated the trait on which the essay was to turn, I heard
it for the first time; the matter was new to me, and I had no material
for its treatment. But I got books, read up the facts, laboriously
constructed a skeleton out of the dry bones of the real, and then
clothed them, and tried to breathe into them life, and in this last aim
I had pleasure. With me it was a difficult and anxious time till my
facts were found, selected, and properly jointed; nor could I rest from
research and effort till I was satisfied of correct anatomy; the
strength of my inward repugnance to the idea of flaw or falsity
sometimes enabled me to shun egregious blunders; but the knowledge was
not there in my head, ready and mellow; it had not been sown in Spring,
grown in Summer, harvested in Autumn, and garnered through Winter;
whatever I wanted I must go out and gather fresh; glean of wild herbs
my lapful, and shred them green into the pot. Messieurs Boissec and
Rochemorte did not perceive this. They mistook my work for the work of
a ripe scholar.

<p/>They would not yet let me go: I must sit down and write before them. As
I dipped my pen in the ink with a shaking hand, and surveyed the white
paper with eyes half-blinded and overflowing, one of my judges began
mincingly to apologize for the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) caused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nous agissons dans l'intérêt de la vérité. Nous ne voulons pas vous
blesser,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>).

<p/>Scorn gave me nerve. I only answered,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dictate, Monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Rochemorte named this theme: <div class="bookquote">``Human Justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rochemorte</b></font>)</div><p/>Human Justice! What was I to make of it? Blank, cold abstraction,
unsuggestive to me of one inspiring idea; and there stood M. Emanuel,
sad as Saul, and stern as Joab, and there triumphed his (<font color='blue'><b>Saul</b></font>) accusers.

<p/>At these two I looked. I was gathering my courage to tell them that I
would neither write nor speak another word for their satisfaction, that
their theme did not suit, nor their presence inspire me, and that,
notwithstanding, whoever threw the shadow of a doubt on M. Emanuel's
honour, outraged that truth of which they had announced themselves
the--champions: I _meant_ to utter all this, I say, when suddenly, a
light darted on memory.

<p/>Those two faces looking out of the forest of long hair, moustache, and
whisker--those two cold yet bold, trustless yet presumptuous
visages--were the same faces, the very same that, projected in full
gaslight from behind the pillars of a portico, had half frightened me
to death on the night of my desolate arrival in Villette. These, I felt
morally certain, were the very heroes who had driven a friendless
foreigner beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reckoning and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) strength, chased her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breathless
over a whole quarter of the town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pious mentors!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>thought I. <div class="bookquote">``Pure guides for youth! If Human Justice'
were what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to be, you two would scarce hold your present post,
or enjoy your present credit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>An idea once seized, I fell to work. <div class="bookquote">``Human Justice''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>rushed before me
in novel guise, a red, random beldame, with arms akimbo. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) house, the den of confusion: servants called to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for orders or
help which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not give; beggars stood at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) door waiting and
starving unnoticed; a swarm of children, sick and quarrelsome, crawled
round her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feet, and yelled in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ears appeals for notice, sympathy,
cure, redress. The honest woman cared for none of these things. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
a warm seat of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own by the fire, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own solace in a short
black pipe, and a bottle of Mrs. Sweeny's soothing syrup; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) smoked
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) sipped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) paradise; and whenever a cry of the
suffering souls about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) pierced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) ears too keenly--my jolly dame
seized the poker or the hearth-brush: if the offender was weak,
wronged, and sickly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) effectually settled him (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>): if he (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) was strong,
lively, and violent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) only menaced, then plunged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sweeny</b></font>)
deep pouch, and flung a liberal shower of sugar-plums.

<p/>Such was the sketch of <div class="bookquote">``Human Justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Messieurs Boissec/Boissec</b></font>)</div>scratched hurriedly on paper,
and placed at the service of Messrs. Boissec and Rochemorte. M. Emanuel
read it over my shoulder. Waiting no comment, I curtsied to the trio,
and withdrew.

<p/>After school that day, M. Paul and I again met. Of course the meeting
did not at first run smooth; there was a crow to pluck with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); that
forced examination could not be immediately digested. A crabbed
dialogue terminated in my being called <div class="bookquote">``une petite moqueuse et
sans-coeur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur/Monsieur Paul/MONSIEUR</b></font>)</div>and in Monsieur's temporary departure.

<p/>Not wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) to go quite away, only desiring he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) should feel that
such a transport as he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) had that day given way to, could not be indulged
with perfect impunity, I was not sorry to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>), soon after,
gardening in the berceau. He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) approached the glass door; I drew near
also. We spoke of some flowers growing round it. By-and-by Monsieur
laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) spade; by-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) recommenced conversation, passed to
other subjects, and at last touched a point of interest.

<p/>Conscious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) proceeding of that day was specially open to a
charge of extravagance, M. Paul half apologized; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) half regretted,
too, the fitfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) moods at all times, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hinted that some
allowance ought to be made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I can hardly
expect it at your hands, Miss Lucy; you know neither me, nor my
position, nor my history.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) history. I took up the word at once; I pursued the idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, as you say, I know neither your
history, nor your position, nor your sacrifices, nor any of your
sorrows, or trials, or affections, or fidelities. Oh, no! I know
nothing about you; you are for me altogether a stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hein?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) murmured, arching his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brows in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Monsieur, I only see you in classe--stern, dogmatic, hasty,
imperious. I only hear of you in town as active and wilful, quick to
originate, hasty to lead, but slow to persuade, and hard to bend. A man
like you, without ties, can have no attachments; without dependants, no
duties. All we, with whom you come in contact, are machines, which you
thrust here and there, inconsiderate of their feelings. You seek your
recreations in public, by the light of the evening chandelier: this
school and yonder college are your workshops, where you fabricate the
ware called pupils. I don't so much as know where you live; it is
natural to take it for granted that you have no home, and need none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am judged,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Your opinion of me is just what I thought it
was. For you I am neither a man nor a Christian. You see me void of
affection and religion, unattached by friend or family, unpiloted by
principle or faith. It is well, Mademoiselle; such is our reward in
this life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a philosopher, Monsieur; a cynic philosopher''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and I looked at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) paletôt, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) straightway brushed the dim sleeve with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
hand-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``despising the foibles of humanity--above its
luxuries--independent of its comforts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Et vous, Mademoiselle? vous êtes proprette et douillette, et
affreusement insensible, par-dessus le marché.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, in short, Monsieur, now I think of it, you _must_ live somewhere?
Do tell me where; and what establishment of servants do you keep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a fearful projection of the under-lip, implying an impetus of
scorn the most decided, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) broke out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Je vis dans un trou! I inhabit a den, Miss--a cavern, where you would
not put your dainty nose. Once, with base shame of speaking the whole
truth, I talked about my `study' in that college: know now that this
`study' is my whole abode; my chamber is there and my drawing-room. As
for my `establishment of servants'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-mimicking my voice-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``they number
ten; les voilà.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) grimly spread, close under my eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ten fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I black my boots,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>pursued he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) savagely. <div class="bookquote">``I brush my paletôt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Monsieur, it is too plain; you never do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my parenthesis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Je fais mon lit et mon ménage; I seek my dinner in a restaurant; my
supper takes care, of itself; I pass days laborious and loveless;
nights long and lonely; I am ferocious, and bearded and monkish; and
nothing now living in this world loves me, except some old hearts worn
like my own, and some few beings, impoverished, suffering, poor in
purse and in spirit, whom the kingdoms of this world own not, but to
whom a will and testament not to be disputed has bequeathed the kingdom
of heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Monsieur; but I know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you know? many things, I verily believe; yet not me, Lucy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that you have a pleasant old house in a pleasant old square of
the Basse-Ville--why don't you go and live there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hein?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>muttered he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I liked it much, Monsieur; with the steps ascending to the door, the
grey flags in front, the nodding trees behind--real trees, not
shrubs--trees dark, high, and of old growth. And the
boudoir-oratoire--you should make that room your study; it is so quiet
and solemn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eyed me closely; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) half-smiled, half-coloured. <div class="bookquote">``Where did you pick
up all that? Who told you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody told me. Did I dream it, Monsieur, do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I enter into your visions? Can I guess a woman's waking thoughts,
much less her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeping fantasies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I dreamt it, I saw in my dream human beings as well as a house. I
saw a priest, old, bent, and grey, and a domestic--old, too, and
picturesque; and a lady, splendid but strange; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head would scarce
reach to my elbow--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) magnificence might ransom a duke. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wore a
gown bright as lapis-lazuli--a shawl worth a thousand francs: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
decked with ornaments so brilliant, I never saw any with such a
beautiful sparkle; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) figure looked as if it had been broken in
two and bent double; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed also to have outlived the common years
of humanity, and to have attained those which are only labour and
sorrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was become morose--almost malevolent; yet _somebody_, it
appears, cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) infirmities--somebody forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
trespasses, hoping to have his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) trespasses forgiven. They lived
together, these three people--the mistress, the chaplain, the
servant--all old, all feeble, all sheltered under one kind wing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) covered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand the upper part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face, but did not
conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mouth, where I saw hovering an expression I liked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you have entered into my secrets,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but how was it
done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) how--the commission on which I had been sent, the storm
which had detained me, the abruptness of the lady, the kindness of the
priest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I sat waiting for the rain to cease, Père Silas whiled away the
time with a story,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A story! What story? Père Silas is no romancist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell Monsieur the tale?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: begin at the beginning. Let me hear some of Miss Lucy's
French--her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) best or her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) worst--I don't much care which: let us have a
good poignée of barbarisms, and a bounteous dose of the insular accent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Monsieur is not going to be gratified by a tale of ambitious
proportions, and the spectacle of the narrator sticking fast in the
midst. But I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) the title--the <div class="bookquote">``Priest's Pupil.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), the swarthy flush again dyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) dark cheek. ``The
good old father could not have chosen a worse subject; it is his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) weak
point. But what of the <div class="bookquote">``Priest's Pupil?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! many things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may as well define _what_ things. I mean to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``There was the pupil's youth, the pupil's manhood;--his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) avarice, his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>)
ingratitude, his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) implacability, his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) inconstancy. Such a bad pupil,
Monsieur!--so thankless, cold-hearted, unchivalrous, unforgiving!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Et puis?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), taking a cigar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Et puis,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pursued, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) underwent calamities which one did not
pity--bore them in a spirit one did not admire--endured wrongs for

heaping coals of fire on his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) adversary's head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not told me all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly all, I think: I have indicated the heads of Père Silas's
chapters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have forgotten one--that which touched on the pupil's lack of
affection--on his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) hard, cold, monkish heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True; I remember now. Père Silas _did_ say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) vocation was
almost that of a priest--that his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) life was considered consecrated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By what bonds or duties?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the ties of the past and the charities of the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have, then, the whole situation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have now told Monsieur all that was told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Some meditative minutes passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mademoiselle Lucy, look at me, and with that truth which I
believe you never knowingly violate, answer me one question. Raise your
eyes; rest them on mine; have no hesitation; fear not to trust me--I am
a man to be trusted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I raised my eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knowing me thoroughly now--all my antecedents, all my
responsibilities--having long known my faults, can you and I still be
friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Monsieur wants a friend in me, I shall be glad to have a friend in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But a close friend I mean--intimate and real--kindred in all but
blood. Will Miss Lucy be the sister of a very poor, fettered, burdened,
encumbered man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) in words, yet I suppose I _did_ answer him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
took my hand, which found comfort, in the shelter of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>). _His (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)_
friendship was not a doubtful, wavering benefit--a cold, distant
hope--a sentiment so brittle as not to bear the weight of a finger: I
at once felt -LRB-or _thought_ I felt-RRB- its support like that of some rock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I talk of friendship, I mean _true_ friendship,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) repeated
emphatically; and I could hardly believe that words so earnest had
blessed my ear; I hardly could credit the reality of that kind, anxious
look he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) gave. If he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) _really_ wished for my confidence and regard, and
_really_ would give me his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)--why, it seemed to me that life could offer
nothing more or better. In that case, I was become strong and rich: in
a moment I was made substantially happy. To ascertain the fact, to fix
and seal it, I asked--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Monsieur quite serious? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needs me, and can
take an interest in me as a sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``a lonely man like me, who has no sister,
must be but too glad to find in some woman's heart a sister's pure
affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And dare I rely on Monsieur's regard? Dare I speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) when I am so
inclined?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My little sister must make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own experiments,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I will give
no promises. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must tease and try her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wayward brother till she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has
drilled him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) into what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wishes. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is no inductile
material in some hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) spoke, the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) voice, the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) now
affectionate eye, gave me such a pleasure as, certainly, I had never
felt. I envied no girl her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover, no bride her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bridegroom, no wife her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
husband; I was content with this my voluntary, self-offering friend. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would but prove reliable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) _looked_ reliable, what, beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
friendship, could I ever covet? But, if all melted like a dream, as
once before had happened--?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Qu'est-ce donc? What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), as this thought threw its weight
on my heart, its shadow on my countenance. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); and after a
moment's pause, and a thoughtful smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) showed me how an equal
fear--lest I should weary of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), a man of moods so difficult and
fitful--had haunted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind for more than one day, or one month.

<p/>On hearing this, a quiet courage cheered me. I ventured a word of
re-assurance. That word was not only tolerated; its repetition was
courted. I grew quite happy--strangely happy--in making him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) secure,
content, tranquil. Yesterday, I could not have believed that earth
held, or life afforded, moments like the few I was now passing.
Countless times it had been my lot to watch apprehended sorrow close
darkly in; but to see unhoped-for happiness take form, find place, and
grow more real as the seconds sped, was indeed a new experience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>said M. Paul, speaking low, and still holding my hand, <div class="bookquote">``did you
see a picture in the boudoir of the old house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did; a picture painted on a panel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The portrait of a nun?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You heard her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) history?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember what we saw that night in the berceau?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not connect the two ideas; that would be folly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought of the apparition when I saw the portrait,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; which
was true enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not, nor will you fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>pursued he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that a saint in heaven
perturbs herself with rivalries of earth? Protestants are rarely
superstitious; these morbid fancies will not beset _you?_''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not what to think of this matter; but I believe a perfectly
natural solution of this seeming mystery will one day be arrived at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubtless, doubtless. Besides, no good-living woman--much less a pure,
happy spirit--would trouble amity like ours n'est-il pas vrai?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Ere I could answer, Fifine Beck burst in, rosy and abrupt, calling out
that I was wanted. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother was going into town to call on some
English family, who had applied for a prospectus: my services were
needed as interpreter. The interruption was not unseasonable:
sufficient for the day is always the evil; for this hour, its good
sufficed. Yet I should have liked to ask M. Paul whether the <div class="bookquote">``morbid
fancies,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>against which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) warned me, wrought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own brain.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI.

<p/>THE APPLE OF DISCORD.


<p/>Besides Fifine Beck's mother, another power had a word to say to M.
Paul and me, before that covenant of friendship could be ratified. We
were under the surveillance of a sleepless eye: Rome watched jealously
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son through that mystic lattice at which I had knelt once, and to
which M. Emanuel drew nigh month by month--the sliding panel of the
confessional.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why were you so glad to be friends with M. Paul?''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>asks the reader.
<div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) not long been a friend to you? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) not given proof on proof
of a certain partiality in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feelings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had; but still I liked to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) say so earnestly--that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
was my close, true friend; I liked his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) modest doubts, his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) tender
deference--that trust which longed to rest, and was grateful when
taught how. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had called me <div class="bookquote">``sister.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It was well. Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) might call
me what he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) pleased, so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) confided in me. I was willing to be
his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) sister, on condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) did not invite me to fill that
relation to some future wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>); and tacitly vowed as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was to
celibacy, of this dilemma there seemed little danger.

<p/>Through most of the succeeding night I pondered that evening's
interview. I wanted much the morning to break, and then listened for
the bell to ring; and, after rising and dressing, I deemed prayers and
breakfast slow, and all the hours lingering, till that arrived at last
which brought me the lesson of literature. My wish was to get a more
thorough comprehension of this fraternal alliance: to note with how
much of the brother he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would demean himself when we met again; to prove
how much of the sister was in my own feelings; to discover whether I
could summon a sister's courage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a brother's frankness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came. Life is so constructed, that the event does not, cannot, will
not, match the expectation. That whole day he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never accosted me. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
lesson was given rather more quietly than usual, more mildly, and also
more gravely. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was fatherly to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pupils, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not brotherly
to me. Ere he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) left the classe, I expected a smile, if not a word; I got
neither: to my portion fell one nod--hurried, shy.

<p/>This distance, I argued, is accidental--it is involuntary; patience,
and it will vanish. It vanished not; it continued for days; it
increased. I suppressed my surprise, and swallowed whatever other
feelings began to surge.

<p/>Well might I ask when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) offered fraternity--<div class="bookquote">``Dare I rely on you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well
might he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), doubtless knowing himself, withhold all pledge. True, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had
bid me make my own experiments--tease and try him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Vain injunction!
Privilege nominal and unavailable! Some women might use it! Nothing in
my powers or instinct placed me amongst this brave band. Left alone, I
was passive; repulsed, I withdrew; forgotten--my lips would not utter,
nor my eyes dart a reminder. It seemed there had been an error
somewhere in my calculations, and I wanted for time to disclose it.

<p/>But the day came when, as usual, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was to give me a lesson. One
evening in seven he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had long generously bestowed on me, devoting it to
the examination of what had been done in various studies during the
past week, and to the preparation of work for the week in prospect. On
these occasions my schoolroom was anywhere, wherever the pupils and the
other teachers happened to be, or in their close vicinage, very often
in the large second division, where it was easy to choose a quiet nook
when the crowding day pupils were absent, and the few boarders gathered
in a knot about the surveillante's estrade.

<p/>On the customary evening, hearing the customary hour strike, I
collected my books and papers, my pen and ink, and sought the large
division.

<p/>In classe there was no one, and it lay all in cool deep shadow; but
through the open double doors was seen the carré, filled with pupils
and with light; over hall and figures blushed the westering sun. It
blushed so ruddily and vividly, that the hues of the walls and the
variegated tints of the dresses seemed all fused in one warm glow. The
girls were seated, working or studying; in the midst of their circle
stood M. Emanuel, speaking good-humouredly to a teacher. His (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) dark
paletôt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) jetty hair, were tinged with many a reflex of crimson; his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
Spanish face, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) turned it momentarily, answered the sun's
animated kiss with an animated smile. I took my place at a desk.

<p/>The orange-trees, and several plants, full and bright with bloom,
basked also in the sun's laughing bounty; they had partaken it the
whole day, and now asked water. M. Emanuel had a taste for gardening;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) liked to tend and foster plants. I used to think that working
amongst shrubs with a spade or a watering-pot soothed his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) nerves; it
was a recreation to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) often had recourse; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) looked to
the orange-trees, the geraniums, the gorgeous cactuses, and revived
them all with the refreshment their drought needed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lips meantime
sustained his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) precious cigar, that -LRB-for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)-RRB- first necessary and prime
luxury of life; its blue wreaths curled prettily enough amongst the
flowers, and in the evening light. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) spoke no more to the pupils, nor
to the mistresses, but gave many an endearing word to a small
spanieless -LRB-if one may coin a word-RRB-, that nominally belonged to the
house, but virtually owned him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) as master, being fonder of him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) than any
inmate. A delicate, silky, loving, and lovable little doggie she (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was,
trotting at his (<font color='blue'><b>doggie</b></font>) side, looking with expressive, attached eyes into his (<font color='blue'><b>doggie</b></font>)
face; and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>doggie</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>doggie</b></font>) bonnet-grec or his (<font color='blue'><b>doggie</b></font>) handkerchief,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>doggie</b></font>) occasionally did in play, crouching beside it with the air of
a miniature lion guarding a kingdom's flag.

<p/>There were many plants, and as the amateur gardener fetched all the
water from the well in the court, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) own active hands, his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) work
spun on to some length. The great school-clock ticked on. Another hour
struck. The carré and the youthful group lost the illusion of sunset.
Day was drooping. My lesson, I perceived, must to-night be very short;
but the orange-trees, the cacti, the camelias were all served now. Was
it my turn?

<p/>Alas! in the garden were more plants to be looked after,--favourite
rose-bushes, certain choice flowers; little Sylvie's glad bark and
whine followed the receding paletôt down the alleys. I put up some of
my books; I should not want them all; I sat and thought; and waited,
involuntarily deprecating the creeping invasion of twilight.

<p/>Sylvie, gaily frisking, emerged into view once more, heralding the
returning paletôt; the watering-pot was deposited beside the well; it
had fulfilled its office; how glad I was! Monsieur washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) hands in
a little stone bowl. There was no longer time for a lesson now; ere
long the prayer-bell must ring; but still we should meet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would
speak; a chance would be offered of reading in his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) eyes the riddle of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) shyness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) ablutions over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) stood, slowly re-arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>)
cuffs, looking at the horn of a young moon, set pale in the opal sky,
and glimmering faint on the oriel of Jean Baptiste. Sylvie watched the
mood contemplative; its stillness irked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) whined and jumped to
break it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) looked down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Petite exigeante,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you must not be forgotten one moment, it
seems.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) stopped, lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) arms, sauntered across the court, within
a yard of the line of windows near one of which I sat: he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) sauntered
lingeringly, fondling the spaniel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) bosom, calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) tender
names in a tender voice. On the front-door steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) turned; once again
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) looked at the moon, at the grey cathedral, over the remoter spires
and house-roofs fading into a blue sea of night-mist; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) tasted the
sweet breath of dusk, and noted the folded bloom of the garden; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>)
suddenly looked round; a keen beam out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) eye rased the white
façade of the classes, swept the long line of croisées. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>)
bowed; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) did, I had no time to return the courtesy. In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>)
was gone; the moonlit threshold lay pale and shadowless before the
closed front door.

<p/>Gathering in my arms all that was spread on the desk before me, I
carried back the unused heap to its place in the third classe. The
prayer-bell rang; I obeyed its summons.

<p/>The morrow would not restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) to the Rue Fossette, that day being
devoted entirely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>) college. I got through my teaching; I got over
the intermediate hours; I saw evening approaching, and armed myself for
its heavy ennuis. Whether it was worse to stay with my co-inmates, or
to sit alone, I had not considered; I naturally took up the latter
alternative; if there was a hope of comfort for any moment, the heart
or head of no human being in this house could yield it; only under the
lid of my desk could it harbour, nestling between the leaves of some
book, gilding a pencil-point, the nib of a pen, or tinging the black
fluid in that ink-glass. With a heavy heart I opened my desk-lid; with
a weary hand I turned up its contents.

<p/>One by one, well-accustomed books, volumes sewn in familiar covers,
were taken out and put back hopeless: they had no charm; they could not
comfort. Is this something new, this pamphlet in lilac? I had not seen
it before, and I re-arranged my desk this very day--this very
afternoon; the tract must have been introduced within the last hour,
while we were at dinner.

<p/>I opened it. What was it? What would it say to me?

<p/>It was neither tale nor poem, neither essay nor history; it neither
sung, nor related, not discussed. It was a theological work; it
preached and it persuaded.

<p/>I lent to it my ear very willingly, for, small as it was, it possessed
its own spell, and bound my attention at once. It preached Romanism; it
persuaded to conversion. The voice of that sly little book was a
honeyed voice; its accents were all unction and balm. Here roared no
utterance of Rome's thunders, no blasting of the breath of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
displeasure. The Protestant was to turn Papist, not so much in fear of
the heretic's hell, as on account of the comfort, the indulgence, the
tenderness Holy Church offered: far be it from her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) to threaten or to
coerce; her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wish was to guide and win. _She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)_ persecute? Oh dear no! not
on any account!

<p/>This meek volume was not addressed to the hardened and worldly; it was
not even strong meat for the strong: it was milk for babes: the mild
effluence of a mother's love towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tenderest and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) youngest;
intended wholly and solely for those whose head is to be reached
through the heart. Its appeal was not to intellect; it sought to win
the affectionate through their affections, the sympathizing through
their sympathies: St. Vincent de Paul, gathering his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) orphans about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),
never spoke more sweetly.

<p/>I remember one capital inducement to apostacy was held out in the fact
that the Catholic who had lost dear friends by death could enjoy the
unspeakable solace of praying them out of purgatory. The writer did not
touch on the firmer peace of those whose belief dispenses with
purgatory altogether: but I thought of this; and, on the whole,
preferred the latter doctrine as the most consolatory. The little book
amused, and did not painfully displease me. It was a canting,
sentimental, shallow little book, yet something about it cheered my
gloom and made me smile; I was amused with the gambols of this unlicked
wolf-cub muffled in the fleece, and mimicking the bleat of a guileless
lamb. Portions of it reminded me of certain Wesleyan Methodist tracts I
had once read when a child; they were flavoured with about the same
seasoning of excitation to fanaticism. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) that had written it was no
bad man, and while perpetually betraying the trained cunning--the
cloven hoof of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) system--I should pause before accusing himself of
insincerity. His (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) judgment, however, wanted surgical props; it was
rickety.

<p/>I smiled then over this dose of maternal tenderness, coming from the
ruddy old lady of the Seven Hills; smiled, too, at my own
disinclination, not to say disability, to meet these melting favours.
Glancing at the title-page, I found the name of <div class="bookquote">``Père Silas.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A
fly-leaf bore in small, but clear and well-known pencil characters:
<div class="bookquote">``From P. C. D. E. to L--y.''  (<font color='red'><b>pencil characters</b></font>)</div>And when I saw this I laughed: but not in
my former spirit. I was revived.

<p/>A mortal bewilderment cleared suddenly from my head and vision; the
solution of the Sphinx-riddle was won; the conjunction of those two
names, Père Silas and Paul Emanuel, gave the key to all. The penitent
had been with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) director; permitted to withhold nothing; suffered to
keep no corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) heart sacred to God and to himself; the whole
narrative of our late interview had been drawn from him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had avowed
the covenant of fraternity, and spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) adopted sister. How could
such a covenant, such adoption, be sanctioned by the Church? Fraternal
communion with a heretic! I seemed to hear Père Silas annulling the
unholy pact; warning his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) penitent of its perils; entreating, enjoining
reserve, nay, by the authority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) office, and in the name, and by
the memory of all M. Emanuel held most dear and sacred, commanding the
enforcement of that new system whose frost had pierced to the marrow of
my bones.

<p/>These may not seem pleasant hypotheses; yet, by comparison, they were
welcome. The vision of a ghostly troubler hovering in the background,
was as nothing, matched with the fear of spontaneous change arising in
M. Paul himself.

<p/>At this distance of time, I cannot be sure how far the above
conjectures were self-suggested: or in what measure they owed their
origin and confirmation to another quarter. Help was not wanting.

<p/>This evening there was no bright sunset: west and east were one cloud;
no summer night-mist, blue, yet rose-tinged, softened the distance; a
clammy fog from the marshes crept grey round Villette. To-night the
watering-pot might rest in its niche by the well: a small rain had been
drizzling all the afternoon, and still it fell fast and quietly. This
was no weather for rambling in the wet alleys, under the dripping
trees; and I started to hear Sylvie's sudden bark in the garden--her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>)
bark of welcome. Surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) was not accompanied and yet this glad,
quick bark was never uttered, save in homage to one presence.

<p/>Through the glass door and the arching berceau, I commanded the deep
vista of the allée défendue: thither rushed Sylvie, glistening through
its gloom like a white guelder-rose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) ran to and fro, whining,
springing, harassing little birds amongst the bushes. I watched five
minutes; no fulfilment followed the omen. I returned to my books;
Sylvie's sharp bark suddenly ceased. Again I looked up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) was
standing not many yards distant, wagging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) white feathery tail as
fast as the muscle would work, and intently watching the operations of
a spade, plied fast by an indefatigable hand. There was M. Emanuel,
bent over the soil, digging in the wet mould amongst the rain-laden and
streaming shrubs, working as hard as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) day's pittance were yet to
earn by the literal sweat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) brow.

<p/>In this sign I read a ruffled mood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would dig thus in frozen snow on
the coldest winter day, when urged inwardly by painful emotion, whether
of nervous excitation, or, sad thoughts of self-reproach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would dig
by the hour, with knit brow and set teeth, nor once lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) head, or
open his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lips.

<p/>Sylvie watched till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) was tired. Again scampering devious, bounding
here, rushing there, snuffing and sniffing everywhere; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) at last
discovered me in classe. Instantly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) flew barking at the panes, as if
to urge me forth to share her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) pleasure or her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) master's toil; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) had
seen me occasionally walking in that alley with M. Paul; and I doubt
not, considered it my duty to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) now, wet as it was.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) made such a bustle that M. Paul at last looked up, and of course
perceived why, and at whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) barked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whistled to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) off; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>)
only barked the louder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) seemed quite bent upon having the glass
door opened. Tired, I suppose, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) importunity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
spade, approached, and pushed the door ajar. Sylvie burst in all
impetuous, sprang to my lap, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) paws at my neck, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>)
little nose and tongue somewhat overpoweringly busy about my face,
mouth, and eyes, flourished her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) bushy tail over the desk, and scattered
books and papers far and wide.

<p/>M. Emanuel advanced to still the clamour and repair the disarrangement.
Having gathered up the books, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) captured Sylvie, and stowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) away
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) paletôt, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) nestled as quiet as a mouse, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) head just
peeping forth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) was very tiny, and had the prettiest little innocent
face, the silkiest long ears, the finest dark eyes in the world. I
never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>), but I thought of Paulina de Bassompierre: forgive the
association, reader, it _would_ occur.

<p/>M. Paul petted and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>); the endearments she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) received were not to
be wondered at; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) invited affection by her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) beauty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) vivacious
life.

<p/>While caressing the spaniel, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) eye roved over the papers and books
just replaced; it settled on the religious tract. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips moved; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
half checked the impulse to speak. What! had he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) promised never to
address me more? If so, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) better nature pronounced the vow <div class="bookquote">``more
honoured in the breach than in the observance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for with a second
effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spoke.--<div class="bookquote">``You have not yet read the brochure, I presume? It
is not sufficiently inviting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I replied that I had read it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waited, as if wishing me to give an opinion upon it unasked.
Unasked, however, I was in no mood to do or say anything. If any
concessions were to be made--if any advances were demanded--that was
the affair of the very docile pupil of Père Silas, not mine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) eye
settled upon me gently: there was mildness at the moment in its blue
ray--there was solicitude--a shade of pathos; there were meanings
composite and contrasted--reproach melting into remorse. At the moment
probably, he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) would have been glad to see something emotional in me. I
could not show it. In another minute, however, I should have betrayed
confusion, had I not bethought myself to take some quill-pens from my
desk, and begin soberly to mend them.

<p/>I knew that action would give a turn to his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) mood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) never liked to see
me mend pens; my knife was always dull-edged--my hand, too, was
unskilful; I hacked and chipped. On this occasion I cut my own
finger--half on purpose. I wanted to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) natural state,
to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) ease, to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) to chide.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maladroit!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) cried at last, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will make mincemeat of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) put Sylvie down, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvie</b></font>) lie quiet beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) bonnet-grec, and,
depriving me of the pens and penknife, proceeded to slice, nib, and
point with the accuracy and celerity of a machine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I like the little book?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) now inquired.

<p/>Suppressing a yawn, I said I hardly knew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had it moved me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it had made me a little sleepy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-After a pause:-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Allons donc! It was of no use taking that tone with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>). Bad as I was--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) should be sorry to have to name all my faults
at a breath--God and nature had given me `trop de sensibilité et de
sympathie' not to be profoundly affected by an appeal so touching.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I responded, rousing myself quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I was not affected at
all--not a whit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And in proof, I drew from my pocket a perfectly dry handkerchief, still
clean and in its folds.

<p/>Hereupon I was made the object of a string of strictures rather piquant
than polite. I listened with zest. After those two days of unnatural
silence, it was better than music to hear M. Paul haranguing again just
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) old fashion. I listened, and meantime solaced myself and Sylvie
with the contents of a bonbonnière, which M. Emanuel's gifts kept well
supplied with chocolate comfits: It pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) to see even a small
matter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) hand duly appreciated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) looked at me and the spaniel
while we shared the spoil; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) penknife. Touching my hand
with the bundle of new-cut quills, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) said:--<div class="bookquote">``Dites donc, petite
soeur--speak frankly--what have you thought of me during the last two
days?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But of this question I would take no manner of notice; its purport made
my eyes fill. I caressed Sylvie assiduously. M. Paul, leaning--over the
desk, bent towards me:--<div class="bookquote">``I called myself your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I
hardly know what I am--brother--friend--I cannot tell. I know I think
of you--I feel I wish, you well--but I must check myself; you are to be
feared. My best friends point out danger, and whisper caution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do right to listen to your friends. By all means be cautious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your religion--your strange, self-reliant, invulnerable creed,
whose influence seems to clothe you in, I know not what, unblessed
panoply. You are good--Père Silas calls you good, and loves you--but
your terrible, proud, earnest Protestantism, there is the danger. It
expresses itself by your eye at times; and again, it gives you certain
tones and certain gestures that make my flesh creep. You are not
demonstrative, and yet, just now--when you handled that tract--my God!
I thought Lucifer smiled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I don't respect that tract--what then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not respect that tract? But it is the pure essence of faith, love,
charity! I thought it would touch you: in its gentleness, I trusted
that it could not fail. I laid it in your desk with a prayer: I must
indeed be a sinner: Heaven will not hear the petitions that come
warmest from my heart. You scorn my little offering. Oh, cela me fait
mal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, I don't scorn it--at least, not as your gift. Monsieur, sit
down; listen to me. I am not a heathen, I am not hard-hearted, I am not
unchristian, I am not dangerous, as they tell you; I would not trouble
your faith; you believe in God and Christ and the Bible, and so do I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But _do_ you believe in the Bible? Do you receive Revelation? What
limits are there to the wild, careless daring of your country and sect.
Père Silas dropped dark hints.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>By dint of persuasion, I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) half-define these hints; they
amounted to crafty Jesuit-slanders. That night M. Paul and I talked
seriously and closely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pleaded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) argued. _I_ could not argue--a
fortunate incapacity; it needed but triumphant, logical opposition to
effect all the director wished to be effected; but I could talk in my
own way--the way M. Paul was used to--and of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could follow the
meanderings and fill the hiatus, and pardon the strange stammerings,
strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) no longer. At ease with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), I could defend my creed and
faith in my own fashion; in some degree I could lull his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) prejudices. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
was not satisfied when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went away, hardly was he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) appeased; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
made thoroughly to feel that Protestants were not necessarily the
irreverent Pagans his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) director had insinuated; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was made to
comprehend something of their mode of honouring the Light, the Life,
the Word; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was enabled partly to perceive that, while their
veneration for things venerable was not quite like that cultivated in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) Church, it had its own, perhaps, deeper power--its own more solemn
awe.

<p/>I found that Père Silas -LRB-himself, I must repeat, not a bad man, though
the advocate of a bad cause-RRB- had darkly stigmatized Protestants in
general, and myself by inference, with strange names, had ascribed to
us strange <div class="bookquote">``isms;''  (<font color='red'><b>Protestants</b></font>)</div>Monsieur Emanuel revealed all this in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) frank
fashion, which knew not secretiveness, looking at me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) spoke with a
kind, earnest fear, almost trembling lest there should be truth in the
charges. Père Silas, it seems, had closely watched me, had ascertained
that I went by turns, and indiscriminately, to the three Protestant
Chapels of Villette--the French, German, and English--_id est_, the
Presbyterian, Lutheran, Episcopalian. Such liberality argued in the
father's eyes profound indifference--who tolerates all, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reasoned,
can be attached to none. Now, it happened that I had often secretly
wondered at the minute and unimportant character of the differences
between these three sects--at the unity and identity of their vital
doctrines: I saw nothing to hinder them from being one day fused into
one grand Holy Alliance, and I respected them all, though I thought
that in each there were faults of form, incumbrances, and trivialities.
Just what I thought, that did I tell M. Emanuel, and explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
that my own last appeal, the guide to which I looked, and the teacher
which I owned, must always be the Bible itself, rather than any sect,
of whatever name or nation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) left me soothed, yet full of solicitude, breathing a wish, as strong
as a prayer, that if I were wrong, Heaven would lead me right. I heard,
poured forth on the threshold, some fervid murmurings to <div class="bookquote">``Marie, Reine
du Ciel,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>some deep aspiration that _his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)_ hope might yet be _mine_.

<p/>Strange! I had no such feverish wish to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) from the faith of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
fathers. I thought Romanism wrong, a great mixed image of gold and
clay; but it seemed to me that _this_ Romanist held the purer elements
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) creed with an innocency of heart which God must love.

<p/>The preceding conversation passed between eight and nine o'clock of the
evening, in a schoolroom of the quiet Rue Fossette, opening on a
sequestered garden. Probably about the same, or a somewhat later hour
of the succeeding evening, its echoes, collected by holy obedience,
were breathed verbatim in an attent ear, at the panel of a
confessional, in the hoary church of the Magi. It ensued that Père
Silas paid a visit to Madame Beck, and stirred by I know not what
mixture of motives, persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>) to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) undertake for a time the
Englishwoman's spiritual direction.

<p/>Hereupon I was put through a course of reading--that is, I just glanced
at the books lent me; they were too little in my way to be thoroughly
read, marked, learned, or inwardly digested. And besides, I had a book
up-stairs, under my pillow, whereof certain chapters satisfied my needs
in the article of spiritual lore, furnishing such precept and example
as, to my heart's core, I was convinced could not be improved on.

<p/>Then Père Silas showed me the fair side of Rome, her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) good works; and
bade me judge the tree by its fruits.

<p/>In answer, I felt and I avowed that these works were _not_ the fruits
of Rome; they were but her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) abundant blossoming, but the fair promise
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) showed the world, That bloom, when set, savoured not of charity;
the apple full formed was ignorance, abasement, and bigotry. Out of
men's afflictions and affections were forged the rivets of their
servitude. Poverty was fed and clothed, and sheltered, to bind it by
obligation to <div class="bookquote">``the Church;''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>orphanage was reared and educated that it
might grow up in the fold of <div class="bookquote">``the Church;''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>sickness was tended that it
might die after the formula and in the ordinance of <div class="bookquote">``the Church;''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>and
men were overwrought, and women most murderously sacrificed, and all
laid down a world God made pleasant for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) creatures' good, and took
up a cross, monstrous in its galling weight, that they might serve
Rome, prove her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sanctity, confirm her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) power, and spread the reign of
her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tyrant <div class="bookquote">``Church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>tyrant Church</b></font>)</div><p/>For man's good was little done; for God's glory, less. A thousand ways
were opened with pain, with blood-sweats, with lavishing of life;
mountains were cloven through their breasts, and rocks were split to
their base; and all for what? That a Priesthood might march straight on
and straight upward to an all-dominating eminence, whence they might at
last stretch the sceptre of their Moloch <div class="bookquote">``Church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Moloch</b></font>)</div><p/>It will not be. God is not with Rome, and, were human sorrows still for
the Son of God, would he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) not mourn over her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) cruelties and ambitions, as
once he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mourned over the crimes and woes of doomed Jerusalem!

<p/>Oh, lovers of power! Oh, mitred aspirants for this world's kingdoms! an
hour will come, even to you, when it will be well for your
hearts--pausing faint at each broken beat--that there is a Mercy beyond
human compassions, a Love, stronger than this strong death which even
you must face, and before it, fall; a Charity more potent than any sin,
even yours; a Pity which redeems worlds--nay, absolves Priests.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>My third temptation was held out in the pomp of Rome--the glory of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
kingdom. I was taken to the churches on solemn occasions--days of fête
and state; I was shown the Papal ritual and ceremonial. I looked at it.

<p/>Many people--men and women--no doubt far my superiors in a thousand
ways, have felt this display impressive, have declared that though
their Reason protested, their Imagination was subjugated. I cannot say
the same. Neither full procession, nor high mass, nor swarming tapers,
nor swinging censers, nor ecclesiastical millinery, nor celestial
jewellery, touched my imagination a whit. What I saw struck me as
tawdry, not grand; as grossly material, not poetically spiritual.

<p/>This I did not tell Père Silas; he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) was old, he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) looked venerable:
through every abortive experiment, under every repeated disappointment,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) remained personally kind to me, and I felt tender of hurting his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>)
feelings. But on the evening of a certain day when, from the balcony of
a great house, I had been made to witness a huge mingled procession of
the church and the army--priests with relics, and soldiers with
weapons, an obese and aged archbishop, habited in cambric and lace,
looking strangely like a grey daw in bird-of-paradise plumage, and a
band of young girls fantastically robed and garlanded--_then_ I spoke
my mind to M. Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I did not respect such ceremonies; I
wished to see no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And having relieved my conscience by this declaration, I was able to go
on, and, speaking more currently and clearly than my wont, to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
that I had a mind to keep to my reformed creed; the more I saw of
Popery the closer I clung to Protestantism; doubtless there were errors
in every church, but I now perceived by contrast how severely pure was
my own, compared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whose painted and meretricious face had been
unveiled for my admiration. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) how we kept fewer forms between
us and God; retaining, indeed, no more than, perhaps, the nature of
mankind in the mass rendered necessary for due observance. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) I
could not look on flowers and tinsel, on wax-lights and embroidery, at
such times and under such circumstances as should be devoted to lifting
the secret vision to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) whose home is Infinity, and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
being--Eternity. That when I thought of sin and sorrow, of earthly
corruption, mortal depravity, weighty temporal woe--I could not care
for chanting priests or mumming officials; that when the pains of
existence and the terrors of dissolution pressed before me--when the
mighty hope and measureless doubt of the future arose in view--_then_,
even the scientific strain, or the prayer in a language learned and
dead, harassed: with hindrance a heart which only longed to cry--<div class="bookquote">``God
be merciful to me, a sinner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>When I had so spoken, so declared my faith, and so widely severed
myself, from him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) I addressed--then, at last, came a tone accordant, an
echo responsive, one sweet chord of harmony in two conflicting spirits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever say priests or controversialists,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>murmured M. Emanuel, ``God
is good, and loves all the sincere. Believe, then, what you can;
believe it as you can; one prayer, at least, we have in common; I also
cry--<div class="bookquote">``O Dieu, sois appaisé envers moi qui suis pécheur!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) leaned on the back of my chair. After some thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) again spoke:

<p/>``How seem in the eyes of that God who made all firmaments, from whose
nostrils issued whatever of life is here, or in the stars shining
yonder--how seem the differences of man? But as Time is not for God,
nor Space, so neither is Measure, nor Comparison. We abase ourselves in
our littleness, and we do right; yet it may be that the constancy of
one heart, the truth and faith of one mind according to the light He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
has appointed, import as much to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as the just motion of satellites
about their planets, of planets about their suns, of suns around that
mighty unseen centre incomprehensible, irrealizable, with strange
mental effort only divined.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXVII.

<p/>SUNSHINE.


<p/>It was very, well for Paulina to decline further correspondence with
Graham till her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) father had sanctioned the intercourse. But Dr. Bretton
could not live within a league of the Hôtel Crécy, and not contrive to
visit there often. Both lovers meant at first, I believe, to be
distant; they kept their intention so far as demonstrative courtship
went, but in feeling they soon drew very near.

<p/>All that was best in Graham sought Paulina; whatever in him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was noble,
awoke, and grew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) presence. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) past admiration of Miss
Fanshawe, I suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) intellect had little to do, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) whole
intellect, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) highest tastes, came in question now. These, like
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) faculties, were active, eager for nutriment, and alive to
gratification when it came.

<p/>I cannot say that Paulina designedly led him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) to talk of books, or
formally proposed to herself for a moment the task of winning him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) to
reflection, or planned the improvement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mind, or so much as
fancied his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mind could in any one respect be improved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
very perfect; it was Graham himself, who, at first by the merest
chance, mentioned some book he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had been reading, and when in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
response sounded a welcome harmony of sympathies, something, pleasant
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) talked on, more and better perhaps than he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had ever
talked before on such subjects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) listened with delight, and answered
with animation. In each successive answer, Graham heard a music waxing
finer and finer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) sense; in each he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) found a suggestive,
persuasive, magic accent that opened a scarce-known treasure-house
within, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) unsuspected power in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) own mind, and what was
better, latent goodness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) heart. Each liked the way in which the
other talked; the voice, the diction, the expression pleased; each
keenly relished the flavour of the other's wit; they met each other's
meaning with strange quickness, their thoughts often matched like
carefully-chosen pearls. Graham had wealth of mirth by nature; Paulina
possessed no such inherent flow of animal spirits--unstimulated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
inclined to be thoughtful and pensive--but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) seemed merry as a
lark; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lover's genial presence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) glanced like some soft glad
light. How beautiful she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) grew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) happiness, I can hardly express,
but I wondered to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>). As to that gentle ice of hers--that reserve
on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had depended; where was it now? Ah! Graham would not long
bear it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) a generous influence that soon thawed the
timid, self-imposed restriction.

<p/>Now were the old Bretton days talked over; perhaps brokenly at first,
with a sort of smiling diffidence, then with opening candour and still
growing confidence. Graham had made for himself a better opportunity
than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had wished me to give; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had earned independence of the
collateral help that disobliging Lucy had refused; all his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
reminiscences of <div class="bookquote">``little Polly''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Lucy Snowe/Miss Snowe</b></font>)</div>found their proper expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
own pleasant tones, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) own kind and handsome lips; how much better
than if suggested by me.

<p/>More than once when we were alone, Paulina would tell me how wonderful
and curious it was to discover the richness and accuracy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) memory
in this matter. How, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), recollections would
seem to be suddenly quickened in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had
once gathered his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) arms, caressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) leonine graces, and
cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Graham, I _do_ like you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) would set a
footstool beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), and climb by its aid to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) knee. At this day he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) could recall the sensation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) little hands smoothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
cheek, or burying themselves in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) thick mane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) remembered the touch
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) small forefinger, placed half tremblingly, half curiously, in
the cleft in his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) chin, the lisp, the look with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) would name it
<div class="bookquote">``a pretty dimple,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>then seek his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eyes and question why they pierced so,
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had a <div class="bookquote">``nice, strange face; far nicer, far stranger, than
either his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mamma or Lucy Snowe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Child as I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div>remarked Paulina, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder how I dared be so
venturous. To me he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) seems now all sacred, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) locks are inaccessible,
and, Lucy, I feel a sort of fear, when I look at his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) firm, marble chin,
at his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) straight Greek features. Women are called beautiful, Lucy; he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) is
not like a woman, therefore I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) is not beautiful, but what is
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), then? Do other people see him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) with my eyes? Do _you_ admire him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paulina/Paulina Mary/PAULINA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I do, Paulina,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was once my answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) many
questions. <div class="bookquote">''_I never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)_. I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) twice or thrice about a
year ago, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) recognised me, and then I shut my eyes; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
were to cross their balls twelve times between each day's sunset and
sunrise, except from memory, I should hardly know what shape had gone
by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), under her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that I value vision, and dread being struck stone blind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It was best to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) strongly at once, and to silence for ever the
tender, passionate confidences which left her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lips sweet honey, and
sometimes dropped in my ear--molten lead. To me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) commented no more
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lover's beauty.

<p/>Yet speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) would; sometimes shyly, in quiet, brief phrases;
sometimes with a tenderness of cadence, and music of voice exquisite in
itself; but which chafed me at times miserably; and then, I know, I
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) stern looks and words; but cloudless happiness had dazzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
native clear sight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) only thought Lucy--fitful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spartan girl! Proud Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would say, smiling at me. <div class="bookquote">``Graham says
you are the most peculiar, capricious little woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) knows; but yet
you are excellent; we both think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You both think you know not what,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Have the goodness to make
me as little the subject of your mutual talk and thoughts as possible.
I have my sort of life apart from yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But ours, Lucy, is a beautiful life, or it will be; and you shall
share it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall share no man's or woman's life in this world, as you
understand sharing. I think I have one friend of my own, but am not
sure; and till I _am_ sure, I live solitary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But solitude is sadness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it is sadness. Life, however; has worse than that. Deeper than
melancholy, lies heart-break.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, I wonder if anybody will ever comprehend you altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lovers</b></font>)</div><p/>There is, in lovers, a certain infatuation of egotism; they will have a
witness of their happiness, cost that witness what it may. Paulina had
forbidden letters, yet Dr. Bretton wrote; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had resolved against
correspondence, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) answered, were it only to chide. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) showed me
these letters; with something of the spoiled child's wilfulness, and of
the heiress's imperiousness, she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) _made_ me read them. As I read
Graham's, I scarce wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) exaction, and understood her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) pride:
they were fine letters--manly and fond--modest and gallant. Hers must
have appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) beautiful. They had not been written to show her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)
talents; still less, I think, to express her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) love. On the contrary, it
appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) had proposed to herself the task of hiding that
feeling, and bridling her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) lover's ardour. But how could such letters
serve such a purpose? Graham was become dear as her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) life; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)
like a powerful magnet. For her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) there was influence unspeakable in all
he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) uttered, wrote, thought, or looked. With this unconfessed
confession, her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) letters glowed; it kindled them, from greeting to adieu.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish papa knew; I _do_ wish papa knew!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>began now to be her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) anxious
murmur. <div class="bookquote">``I wish, and yet I fear. I can hardly keep Graham back from
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). There is nothing I long for more than to have this affair
settled--to speak out candidly; and yet I dread the crisis. I know, I
am certain, papa will be angry at the first; I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will dislike me
almost; it will seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) an untoward business; it will be a
surprise, a shock: I can hardly foresee its whole effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>father calm</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact was--her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) father, long calm, was beginning to be a little
stirred: long blind on one point, an importunate light was beginning to
trespass on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eye.

<p/>To _her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)_, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said nothing; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) was not looking at, or perhaps
thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gaze and meditate on her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>).

<p/>One evening--Paulina was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) dressing-room, writing, I believe, to
Graham; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) had left me in the library, reading--M. de Bassompierre
came in; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) sat down: I was about to withdraw; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) requested me to
remain--gently, yet in a manner which showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) wished compliance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)
had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) seat near the window, at a distance from me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) opened a
desk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) took from it what looked like a memorandum-book; of this book
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) studied a certain entry for several minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Snowe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>), laying it down, <div class="bookquote">``do you know my little girl's
age?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About eighteen, is it not, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems so. This old pocket-book tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) was born on the 5th of
May, in the year 18--, eighteen years ago. It is strange; I had lost
the just reckoning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) age. I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) as twelve--fourteen--an
indefinite date; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) seemed a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is about eighteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is grown up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) will be no
taller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My little jewel!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bassompierre/de Bassompierre/M. DE BASSOMPIERRE</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bassompierre, in a tone which penetrated
like some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) daughter's accents.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) sat very thoughtful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, don't grieve,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; for I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) feelings, utterly unspoken
as they were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is the only pearl I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and now others will find out
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is pure and of price: they will covet her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I made no answer. Graham Bretton had dined with us that day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had
shone both in converse and looks: I know not what pride of bloom
embellished his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) aspect and mellowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) intercourse. Under the stimulus
of a high hope, something had unfolded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) whole manner which
compelled attention. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had purposed on that day to indicate
the origin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) endeavours, and the aim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) ambition. M. de
Bassompierre had found himself forced, in a manner, to descry the
direction and catch the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) homage. Slow in remarking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)
was logical in reasoning: having once seized the thread, it had guided
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) through a long labyrinth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is up-stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) is writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) writes, does she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>)? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) receive letters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None but such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) can show me. And--sir--she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>)--_they_ have long
wanted to consult you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw! They don't think of me--an old father! I am in the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, M. de Bassompierre--not so--that can't be! But Paulina must speak
for herself: and Dr. Bretton, too, must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) own advocate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a little late. Matters are advanced, it seems.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, till you approve, nothing is done--only they love each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) echoed.

<p/>Invested by fate with the part of confidante and mediator, I was
obliged to go on: <div class="bookquote">``Hundreds of times has Dr. Bretton been on the point
of appealing to you, sir; but, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) high courage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) fears you
mortally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) may well--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) may well fear me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) has touched the best thing I
have. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) but let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would have remained a child for
years yet. So. Are they engaged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They could not become engaged without your permission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well for you, Miss Snowe, to talk and think with that propriety
which always characterizes you; but this matter is a grief to me; my
little girl was all I had: I have no more daughters and no son; Bretton
might as well have looked elsewhere; there are scores of rich and
pretty women who would not, I daresay, dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) has looks, and
conduct, and connection. Would nothing serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) but my Polly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div><p/>``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had never seen your ``Polly,<div class="bookquote">'' others might and would have pleased
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)--your niece, Miss Fanshawe, for instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I would have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) Ginevra with all my heart; but Polly!--I
can't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>). No--I can't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) is not her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) equal,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) affirmed,
rather gruffly. <div class="bookquote">``In what particular is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) match? They talk of

of these things--and Polly will be rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is known,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I: <div class="bookquote">``all Villette knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) as an heiress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they talk of my little girl in that light?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) fell into deep thought. I ventured to say, <div class="bookquote">``Would you, sir, think
any one Paulina's match? Would you prefer any other to Dr. Bretton? Do
you think higher rank or more wealth would make much difference in your
feelings towards a future son-in-law?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You touch me there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the aristocracy of Villette--you would not like them, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not--never a duc, baron, or vicomte of the lot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am told many of these persons think about her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on,
gaining courage on finding that I met attention rather than repulse.
<div class="bookquote">``Other suitors will come, therefore, if Dr. Bretton is refused.
Wherever you go, I suppose, aspirants will not be wanting. Independent
of heiress-ship, it appears to me that Paulina charms most of those who
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)? How? My little girl is not thought a beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, Miss de Bassompierre is very beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!--begging your pardon, Miss Snowe, but I think you are too

I am her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) father; and even I never thought about beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) is amusing,
fairy-like, interesting to me;--you must be mistaken in supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>)
handsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) attracts, sir: she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) would attract without the advantages of your

so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Bretton knows these points perfectly, as you may be sure, M. de

yourself, under the same circumstances--but they are not his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) baits. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
loves your daughter very much; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feels her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) finest qualities, and they
influence him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) worthily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! has my little pet `fine qualities?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, sir! did you observe her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that evening when so many men of eminence
and learning dined here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly was rather struck and surprised with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) manner that day;
its womanliness made me smile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you see those accomplished Frenchmen gather round her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did; but I thought it was by way of relaxation--as one might amuse
one's self with a pretty infant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) demeaned herself with distinction; and I heard the French
gentlemen say she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was `pétrie d'esprit et de graces.''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>Dr. Bretton
thought the same.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is a good, dear child, that is certain; and I _do_ believe she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has
some character. When I think of it, I was once ill; Polly nursed me;
they thought I should die; she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>), I recollect, grew at once stronger and
tenderer as I grew worse in health. And as I recovered, what a sunbeam
she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was in my sick-room! Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) played about my chair as noiselessly
and as cheerful as light. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) is sought in marriage! I don't
want to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) groaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have known Dr. and Mrs. Bretton so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested, <div class="bookquote">``it would
be less like separation to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) than to another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) reflected rather gloomily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True. I have long known Louisa Bretton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) and I are
indeed old, old friends; a sweet, kind girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was young.
You talk of beauty, Miss Snowe! _she (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>)_ was handsome, if you will--tall,
straight, and blooming--not the mere child or elf my Polly seems to me:
at eighteen, Louisa had a carriage and stature fit for a princess. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
is a comely and a good woman now. The lad is like her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>); I have always
thought so, and favoured and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) well. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) repays me by this
robbery! My little treasure used to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) old father dearly and
truly. It is all over now, doubtless--I am an incumbrance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The door opened--his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``little treasure''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) was dressed, so to
speak, in evening beauty; that animation which sometimes comes with the
close of day, warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) eye and cheek; a tinge of summer crimson
heightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) complexion; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) curls fell full and long on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) lily
neck; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) white dress suited the heat of June. Thinking me alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
had brought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) hand the letter just written--brought it folded but
unsealed. I was to read it. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) father, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) tripping step
faltered a little, paused a moment--the colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) cheek flowed rosy
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) whole face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Polly,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bassompierre/de Bassompierre/M. DE BASSOMPIERRE</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bassompierre, in a low voice, with a grave smile,

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bassompierre/de Bassompierre/M. DE BASSOMPIERRE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't blush--I never _do_ blush,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>affirmed she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), while another eddy
from the heart sent up its scarlet. <div class="bookquote">``But I thought you were in the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You thought I was with John Graham Bretton, I suppose? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) has just

for you; it will save Matthieu a ``course,<div class="bookquote">'' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) calls it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't post letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>), rather pettishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you do with them, then?--come here and tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Both her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) mind and gesture seemed to hesitate a second--to say <div class="bookquote">``Shall I
come?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) approached.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long is it since you became a letter-writer, Polly? It only seems

with both hands at the pen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, they are not letters to send to the post in your letter-bag;
they are only notes, which I give now and then into the person's hands,
just to satisfy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The person! That means Miss Snowe, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa--not Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who then? Perhaps Mrs. Bretton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa--not Mrs. Bretton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who, then, my little daughter? Tell papa the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) cried with earnestness, <div class="bookquote">``I will--I _will_ tell you the
truth--all the truth; I am glad to tell you--glad, though I tremble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) _did_ tremble: growing excitement, kindling feeling, and also
gathering courage, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate to hide my actions from you, papa. I fear you and love you
above everything but God. Read the letter; look at the address.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) laid it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) knee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) took it up and read it through; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) hand
shaking, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) eyes glistening meantime.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) re-folded it, and viewed the writer with a strange, tender, mournful
amaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can _she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)_ write so--the little thing that stood at my knee but
yesterday? Can she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feel so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, is it wrong? Does it pain you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing wrong in it, my innocent little Mary; but it pains

you unhappy; that would be too wicked!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) shuddered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does the letter not please you? Must it not go? Must it be torn? It

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I order nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Order something, papa; express your wish; only don't hurt, don't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This splendid Graham is a young scamp, Polly--that is my present

never quite fathomed--something his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother has not--a depth which
warned a man not to wade into that stream too far; now, suddenly, I
find myself taken over the crown of the head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, you don't--you have not fallen in; you are safe on the bank; you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Off with him (<font color='blue'><b>czar</b></font>) to Siberia, red whiskers and all; I say, I don't like

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Off with him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Home</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Home, who certainly did look sorely crossed
and annoyed--even a little bitter; <div class="bookquote">``but, I suppose, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) went, Polly
would pack a bundle and run after him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) heart is fairly won--won,
and weaned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) old father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Home</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I say it is naughty, it is decidedly wrong, to talk in that way.
I am _not_ weaned from you, and no human being and no mortal influence

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be married, Polly! Espouse the red whiskers. Cease to be a daughter;

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Red whiskers! I wonder what you mean, papa. You should take care of
prejudice. You sometimes say to me that all the Scotch, your

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave the prejudiced old Scotchman; go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) a minute. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) wanted to show firmness,
superiority to taunts; knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) father's character, guessing his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) few
foibles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) had expected the sort of scene which was now transpiring;
it did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) by surprise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) desired to let it pass with
dignity, reliant upon reaction. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) dignity stood her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) in no stead.
Suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) soul melted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) eyes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) neck:--<div class="bookquote">``I won't
leave you, papa; I'll never leave you. I won't pain you! I'll never
pain you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lamb! my treasure!''  (<font color='red'><b>sire</b></font>)</div>murmured the loving though rugged sire. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said
no more for the moment; indeed, those two words were hoarse.

<p/>The room was now darkening. I heard a movement, a step without.
Thinking it might be a servant coming with candles, I gently opened, to
prevent intrusion. In the ante-room stood no servant: a tall gentleman
was placing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat on the table, drawing off his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves
slowly--lingering, waiting, it seemed to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) called me neither by
sign nor word; yet his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye said:--<div class="bookquote">``Lucy, come here.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And I went.

<p/>Over his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face a smile flowed, while he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked down on me: no temper,
save his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own, would have expressed by a smile the sort of agitation
which now fevered him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``M. de Bassompierre is there--is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inquired, pointing to the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am brought up for judgment, then, and so is _she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was quite stirred up; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) young hand trembled; a vital -LRB-I was going
to write _mortal_, but such words ill apply to one all living like

the old charm, in doing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) bid me, came back. I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) success;
and successful I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was born victor, as some are born
vanquished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Follow me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said; and I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) into Mr. Home's presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``what is my sentence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The father looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>): the daughter kept her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) face hid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bretton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Home</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Home, <div class="bookquote">``you have given me the usual reward of
hospitality. I entertained you; you have taken my best. I was always
glad to see you; you were glad to see the one precious thing I had. You
spoke me fair; and, meantime, I will not say you _robbed_ me, but I am
bereaved, and what I have lost, _you_, it seems, have won.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Home</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I cannot repent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I _feel_ honest enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Graham/Dr. Bretton/Bretton</b></font>)</div>said Graham; and a genuine English blush

added, <div class="bookquote">``I won't deny that in some respects you accuse me justly. In

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! Listen to the Highland tongue!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Home. <div class="bookquote">``Look up, Polly!
Answer this `braw wooer;' send him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) looked up. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shyly glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) eager, handsome suitor. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
gazed tenderly on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) furrowed sire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I love you both,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I can take care of you both. I need

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) alleged with that simplicity of phraseology which at times was wont
to make both her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father and Graham smile. They smiled now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) will be a prodigious inconvenience to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>still persisted Mr.
Home. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), Polly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is too tall; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is in my way. Tell

rather not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) otherwise.''

you and I will bid him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till to-morrow only. Shake hands with Graham, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No: I think not: I am not friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). Don't think to coax me

bone; you hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) must have hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wore a massive ring, set round with
brilliants, of which the sharp facets cut into Graham's flesh and drew
blood: but pain only made Dr. John laugh, as anxiety had made him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with me into my study,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>at last said Mr. Home to the doctor. They
went. Their intercourse was not long, but I suppose it was conclusive.
The suitor had to undergo an interrogatory and a scrutiny on many
things. Whether Dr. Bretton was at times guileful in look and language
or not, there was a sound foundation below. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) answers, I understood
afterwards, evinced both wisdom and integrity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
affairs well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had struggled through entanglements; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) fortunes were
in the way of retrieval; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) proved himself in a position to marry.

<p/>Once more the father and lover appeared in the library. M. de
Bassompierre shut the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), John Bretton: and may God deal with you
as you deal with her (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>Not long after, perhaps a fortnight, I saw three persons, Count de
Bassompierre, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) daughter, and Dr. Graham Bretton, sitting on one
seat, under a low-spreading and umbrageous tree, in the grounds of the
palace at Bois l``Etang. They had come thither to enjoy a summer
evening: outside the magnificent gates their carriage waited to take
them home; the green sweeps of turf spread round them quiet and dim;
the palace rose at a distance, white as a crag on Pentelicus; the
evening star shone above it; a forest of flowering shrubs embalmed the
climate of this spot; the hour was still and sweet; the scene, but for
this group, was solitary.

<p/>Paulina sat between the two gentlemen: while they conversed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) little
hands were busy at some work; I thought at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) was binding a
nosegay. No; with the tiny pair of scissors, glittering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) lap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
had severed spoils from each manly head beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>), and was now
occupied in plaiting together the grey lock and the golden wave. The
plait woven--no silk-thread being at hand to bind it--a tress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>)
own hair was made to serve that purpose; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) tied it like a knot,
prisoned it in a locket, and laid it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``there is an amulet made, which has virtue to keep you
two always friends. You can never quarrel so long as I wear this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>An amulet was indeed made, a spell framed which rendered enmity
impossible. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was become a bond to both, an influence over each, a
mutual concord. From them she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) happiness, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
borrowed, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), with interest, gave back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there, indeed, such happiness on earth?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, as I watched the
father, the daughter, the future husband, now united--all blessed and
blessing.

<p/>Yes; it is so. Without any colouring of romance, or any exaggeration of
fancy, it is so. Some real lives do--for some certain days or
years--actually anticipate the happiness of Heaven; and, I believe, if
such perfect happiness is once felt by good people -LRB-to the wicked it
never comes-RRB-, its sweet effect is never wholly lost. Whatever trials
follow, whatever pains of sickness or shades of death, the glory
precedent still shines through, cheering the keen anguish, and tinging
the deep cloud.

<p/>I will go farther. I _do_ believe there are some human beings so born,
so reared, so guided from a soft cradle to a calm and late grave, that
no excessive suffering penetrates their lot, and no tempestuous
blackness overcasts their journey. And often, these are not pampered,
selfish beings, but Nature's elect, harmonious and benign; men and
women mild with charity, kind agents of God's kind attributes.

<p/>Let me not delay the happy truth. Graham Bretton and Paulina de
Bassompierre were married, and such an agent did Dr. Bretton prove. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
did not with time degenerate; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) faults decayed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) virtues ripened;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) rose in intellectual refinement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) won in moral profit: all dregs
filtered away, the clear wine settled bright and tranquil. Bright, too,
was the destiny of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) sweet wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's love, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
aided in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) progress--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was the corner stone.

<p/>This pair was blessed indeed, for years brought them, with great
prosperity, great goodness: they imparted with open hand, yet wisely.
Doubtless they knew crosses, disappointments, difficulties; but these
were well borne. More than once, too, they had to look on Him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) whose
face flesh scarce can see and live: they had to pay their tribute to
the King of Terrors. In the fulness of years, M. de Bassompierre was
taken: in ripe old age departed Louisa Bretton. Once even there rose a
cry in their halls, of Rachel weeping for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) children; but others
sprang healthy and blooming to replace the lost: Dr. Bretton saw
himself live again in a son who inherited his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) looks and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>)
disposition; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) had stately daughters, too, like himself: these
children he (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) reared with a suave, yet a firm hand; they grew up
according to inheritance and nurture.

<p/>In short, I do but speak the truth when I say that these two lives of
Graham and Paulina were blessed, like that of Jacob's favoured son,
with <div class="bookquote">``blessings of Heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies
under.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob son</b></font>)</div>It was so, for God saw that it was good.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII.

<p/>CLOUD.


<p/>But it is not so for all. What then? His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will be done, as done it
surely will be, whether we humble ourselves to resignation or not. The
impulse of creation forwards it; the strength of powers, seen and
unseen, has its fulfilment in charge. Proof of a life to come must be
given. In fire and in blood, if needful, must that proof be written. In
fire and in blood do we trace the record throughout nature. In fire and
in blood does it cross our own experience. Sufferer, faint not through
terror of this burning evidence. Tired wayfarer, gird up thy loins;
look upward, march onward. Pilgrims and brother mourners, join in
friendly company. Dark through the wilderness of this world stretches
the way for most of us: equal and steady be our tread; be our cross our
banner. For staff we have His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) promise, whose <div class="bookquote">``word is tried, whose way
perfect:''  (<font color='red'><b>staff</b></font>)</div>for present hope His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) providence, <div class="bookquote">``who gives the shield of
salvation, whose gentleness makes great;''  (<font color='red'><b>staff</b></font>)</div>for final home His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) bosom, who
<div class="bookquote">``dwells in the height of Heaven;''  (<font color='red'><b>staff</b></font>)</div>for crowning prize a glory, exceeding
and eternal. Let us so run that we may obtain: let us endure hardness
as good soldiers; let us finish our course, and keep the faith, reliant
in the issue to come off more than conquerors: <div class="bookquote">``Art thou not from
everlasting mine Holy One? WE SHALL NOT DIE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>conquerors</b></font>)</div><p/>On a Thursday morning we were all assembled in classe, waiting for the
lesson of literature. The hour was come; we expected the master.

<p/>The pupils of the first classe sat very still; the cleanly-written
compositions prepared since the last lesson lay ready before them,
neatly tied with ribbon, waiting to be gathered by the hand of the
Professor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) rapid round of the desks. The month was July,
the morning fine, the glass-door stood ajar, through it played a fresh
breeze, and plants, growing at the lintel, waved, bent, looked in,
seeming to whisper tidings.

<p/>M. Emanuel was not always quite punctual; we scarcely wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
being a little late, but we wondered when the door at last opened and,
instead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) swiftness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) fire, there came quietly upon
us the cautious Madame Beck.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) approached M. Paul's desk; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stood before it; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) drew round her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
the light shawl covering her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shoulders; beginning to speak in low, yet
firm tones, and with a fixed gaze, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``This morning there will
be no lesson of literature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The second paragraph of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) address followed, after about two minutes'
pause.

<p/>``It is probable the lessons will be suspended for a week. I shall
require at least that space of time to find an efficient substitute for
M. Emanuel. Meanwhile, it shall be our study to fill the blanks
usefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your Professor, ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``intends, if possible, duly to
take leave of you. At the present moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) has not leisure for that
ceremony. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) is preparing for a long voyage. A very sudden and urgent
summons of duty calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) to a great distance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) has decided to leave
Europe for an indefinite time. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) may tell you more himself.
Ladies, instead of the usual lesson with M. Emanuel, you will, this
morning, read English with Mademoiselle Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head courteously, drew closer the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shawl, and
passed from the classe.

<p/>A great silence fell: then a murmur went round the room: I believe some
pupils wept.

<p/>Some time elapsed. The noise, the whispering, the occasional sobbing
increased. I became conscious of a relaxation of discipline, a sort of
growing disorder, as if my girls felt that vigilance was withdrawn, and
that surveillance had virtually left the classe. Habit and the sense of
duty enabled me to rally quickly, to rise in my usual way, to speak in
my usual tone, to enjoin, and finally to establish quiet. I made the
English reading long and close. I kept them at it the whole morning. I
remember feeling a sentiment of impatience towards the pupils who
sobbed. Indeed, their emotion was not of much value: it was only an
hysteric agitation. I told them so unsparingly. I half ridiculed them.
I was severe. The truth was, I could not do with their tears, or that
gasping sound; I could not bear it. A rather weak-minded, low-spirited
pupil kept it up when the others had done; relentless necessity obliged
and assisted me so to accost her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dared not carry on the
demonstration, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was forced to conquer the convulsion.

<p/>That girl would have had a right to hate me, except that, when school
was over and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companions departing, I ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to stay, and when
they were gone, I did what I had never done to one among them
before--pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to my heart and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheek. But, this impulse
yielded to, I speedily put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out of the classe, for, upon that
poignant strain, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wept more bitterly than ever.

<p/>I filled with occupation every minute of that day, and should have
liked to sit up all night if I might have kept a candle burning; the
night, however, proved a bad time, and left bad effects, preparing me
ill for the next day's ordeal of insufferable gossip. Of course this
news fell under general discussion. Some little reserve had accompanied
the first surprise: that soon wore off; every mouth opened; every
tongue wagged; teachers, pupils, the very servants, mouthed the name of
<div class="bookquote">``Emanuel.''  (<font color='red'><b>the servants</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), whose connection with the school was contemporary with
its commencement, thus suddenly to withdraw! All felt it strange.

<p/>They talked so much, so long, so often, that, out of the very multitude
of their words and rumours, grew at last some intelligence. About the
third day I heard it said that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was to sail in a week; then--that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
was bound for the West Indies. I looked at Madame Beck's face, and into
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes, for disproof or confirmation of this report; I perused her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
all over for information, but no part of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) disclosed more than what
was unperturbed and commonplace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This secession was an immense loss to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) alleged. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not
know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should fill up the vacancy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was so used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
kinsman, he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) had become her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) right hand; what should she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) do without him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>)?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had opposed the step, but M. Paul had convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said all this in public, in classe, at the dinner-table, speaking
audibly to Zélie St. Pierre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why was it his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) duty?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that. I had impulses to
take hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) suddenly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) calmly passed me in classe, to
stretch out my hand and grasp her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fast, and say, <div class="bookquote">``Stop. Let us hear the
conclusion of the whole matter. _Why_ is it his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) duty to go into
banishment?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But Madame always addressed some other teacher, and never
looked at me, never seemed conscious I could have a care in the
question.

<p/>The week wore on. Nothing more was said about M. Emanuel coming to bid
us good-by; and none seemed anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) coming; none questioned
whether or not he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would come; none betrayed torment lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) should
depart silent and unseen; incessantly did they talk, and never, in all
their talk, touched on this vital point. As to Madame, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) of course
could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), and say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pleased. What should _she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_
care whether or not he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) appeared in the schoolroom?

<p/>The week consumed. We were told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was going on such a day, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) destination was <div class="bookquote">``Basseterre in Guadaloupe:''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the business which
called him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) abroad related to a friend's interests, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) own: I
thought as much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Basseterre in Guadaloupe.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had little sleep about this time, but
whenever I _did_ slumber, it followed infallibly that I was quickly
roused with a start, while the words <div class="bookquote">``Basseterre,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Guadaloupe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>seemed
pronounced over my pillow, or ran athwart the darkness round and before
me, in zigzag characters of red or violet light.

<p/>For what I felt there was no help, and how could I help feeling? M.
Emanuel had been very kind to me of late days; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had been growing
hourly better and kinder. It was now a month since we had settled the
theological difference, and in all that time there had been no quarrel.
Nor had our peace been the cold daughter of divorce; we had not lived
aloof; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had come oftener, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had talked with me more than before; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
had spent hours with me, with temper soothed, with eye content, with
manner home-like and mild. Kind subjects of conversation had grown
between us; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had inquired into my plans of life, and I had
communicated them; the school project pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) made me repeat it
more than once, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) called it an Alnaschar dream. The jar was
over; the mutual understanding was settling and fixing; feelings of
union and hope made themselves profoundly felt in the heart; affection
and deep esteem and dawning trust had each fastened its bond.

<p/>What quiet lessons I had about this time! No more taunts on my
<div class="bookquote">``intellect,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>no more menaces of grating public shows! How sweetly, for
the jealous gibe, and the more jealous, half-passionate eulogy, were
substituted a mute, indulgent help, a fond guidance, and a tender
forbearance which forgave but never praised. There were times when he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>)
would sit for many minutes and not speak at all; and when dusk or duty
brought separation, he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) would leave with words like these, <div class="bookquote">``Il est doux,
le repos! Il est précieux le calme bonheur!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>One evening, not ten short days since, he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) joined me whilst walking in
my alley. He (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) took my hand. I looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) face. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) meant
to arrest my attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bonne petite amie!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>), softly; <div class="bookquote">``douce consolatrice!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But through
his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) touch, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) words, a new feeling and a strange thought
found a course. Could it be that he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) was becoming more than friend or
brother? Did his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) look speak a kindness beyond fraternity or amity?

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) eloquent look had more to say, his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) hand drew me forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>)
interpreting lips stirred. No. Not now. Here into the twilight alley
broke an interruption: it came dual and ominous: we faced two bodeful
forms--a woman's and a priest's--Madame Beck and Père Silas.

<p/>The aspect of the latter I shall never forget. On the first impulse it
expressed a Jean-Jacques sensibility, stirred by the signs of affection
just surprised; then, immediately, darkened over it the jaundice of
ecclesiastical jealousy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) spoke to _me_ with unction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) looked on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) pupil with sternness. As to Madame Beck, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), of course, saw
nothing--nothing; though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kinsman retained in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presence the hand
of the heretic foreigner, not suffering withdrawal, but clasping it
close and fast.

<p/>Following these incidents, that sudden announcement of departure had
struck me at first as incredible. Indeed, it was only frequent
repetition, and the credence of the hundred and fifty minds round me,
which forced on me its full acceptance. As to that week of suspense,
with its blank, yet burning days, which brought from him (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) no word of
explanation--I remember, but I cannot describe its passage.

<p/>The last day broke. Now would he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) visit us. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) would come and speak
his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) farewell, or he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) would vanish mute, and be seen by us nevermore.

<p/>This alternative seemed to be present in the mind of not a living
creature in that school. All rose at the usual hour; all breakfasted as
usual; all, without reference to, or apparent thought of their late
Professor, betook themselves with wonted phlegm to their ordinary
duties.

<p/>So oblivious was the house, so tame, so trained its proceedings, so
inexpectant its aspect--I scarce knew how to breathe in an atmosphere
thus stagnant, thus smothering. Would no one lend me a voice? Had no
one a wish, no one a word, no one a prayer to which I could say--Amen?

<p/>I had seen them unanimous in demand for the merest trifle--a treat, a
holiday, a lesson's remission; they could not, they _would_ not now
band to besiege Madame Beck, and insist on a last interview with a
Master who had certainly been loved, at least by some--loved as _they_
could love--but, oh! what _is_ the love of the multitude?

<p/>I knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) lived: I knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was to be heard of, or
communicated with; the distance was scarce a stone's-throw: had it been
in the next room--unsummoned, I could make no use of my knowledge. To
follow, to seek out, to remind, to recall--for these things I had no
faculty.

<p/>M. Emanuel might have passed within reach of my arm: had he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) passed
silent and unnoticing, silent and stirless should I have suffered him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
to go by.

<p/>Morning wasted. Afternoon came, and I thought all was over. My heart
trembled in its place. My blood was troubled in its current. I was
quite sick, and hardly knew how to keep at my post--or do my work. Yet
the little world round me plodded on indifferent; all seemed jocund,
free of care, or fear, or thought: the very pupils who, seven days
since, had wept hysterically at a startling piece of news, appeared
quite to have forgotten the news, its import, and their emotion.

<p/>A little before five o'clock, the hour of dismissal, Madame Beck sent
for me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) chamber, to read over and translate some English letter
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) had received, and to write for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) the answer. Before settling to
this work, I observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) softly closed the two doors of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)
chamber; she (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) even shut and fastened the casement, though it was a hot
day, and free circulation of air was usually regarded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) as
indispensable. Why this precaution? A keen suspicion, an almost fierce
distrust, suggested such question. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) want to exclude sound? what
sound?

<p/>I listened as I had never listened before; I listened like the evening
and winter-wolf, snuffing the snow, scenting prey, and hearing far off
the traveller's tramp. Yet I could both listen and write. About the
middle of the letter I heard--what checked my pen--a tread in the
vestibule. No door-bell had rung; Rosine--acting doubtless by
orders--had anticipated such réveillée. Madame saw me halt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)
coughed, made a bustle, spoke louder. The tread had passed on to the
classes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Proceed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame; but my hand was fettered, my ear enchained, my
thoughts were carried off captive.

<p/>The classes formed another building; the hall parted them from the
dwelling-house: despite distance and partition, I heard the sudden stir
of numbers, a whole division rising at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are putting away work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame.

<p/>It was indeed the hour to put away work, but why that sudden hush--that
instant quell of the tumult?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait, Madame--I will see what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And I put down my pen and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>). Left her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)? No: she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) would not be
left: powerless to detain me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) rose and followed, close as my
shadow. I turned on the last step of the stair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you coming, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>); meeting my glance with a peculiar aspect--a look,
clouded, yet resolute.

<p/>We proceeded then, not together, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) walked in my steps.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was come. Entering the first classe, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). There, once more
appeared the form most familiar. I doubt not they had tried to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was come.

<p/>The girls stood in a semicircle; he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was passing round, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
farewells, pressing each hand, touching with his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) lips each cheek. This
last ceremony, foreign custom permitted at such a parting--so solemn,
to last so long.

<p/>I felt it hard that Madame Beck should dog me thus; following and
watching me close; my neck and shoulder shrunk in fever under her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
breath; I became terribly goaded.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) was approaching; the semicircle was almost travelled round; he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) came
to the last pupil; he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) turned. But Madame was before me; she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had stepped
out suddenly; she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) seemed to magnify her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) proportions and amplify her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
drapery; she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eclipsed me; I was hid. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knew my weakness and
deficiency; she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could calculate the degree of moral paralysis--the
total default of self-assertion--with which, in a crisis, I could be
struck. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hastened to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) kinsman, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) broke upon him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) volubly, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
mastered his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) attention, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) to the door--the glass-door
opening on the garden. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) looked round; could I but have caught
his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) eye, courage, I think, would have rushed in to aid feeling, and
there would have been a charge, and, perhaps, a rescue; but already the
room was all confusion, the semicircle broken into groups, my figure
was lost among thirty more conspicuous. Madame had her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) will; yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
got him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) had not seen me; he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) thought me absent. Five
o'clock struck, the loud dismissal-bell rang, the school separated, the
room emptied.

<p/>There seems, to my memory, an entire darkness and distraction in some
certain minutes I then passed alone--a grief inexpressible over a loss
unendurable. _What_ should I do; oh! _what_ should I do; when all my
life's hope was thus torn by the roots out of my riven, outraged heart?

<p/>What I _should_ have done, I know not, when a little child--the least
child in the school--broke with its simplicity and its unconsciousness
into the raging yet silent centre of that inward conflict.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>lisped the treble voice, <div class="bookquote">``I am to give you that. M.
Paul said I was to seek you all over the house, from the grenier to the
cellar, and when I found you, to give you that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>And the child delivered a note; the little dove dropped on my knee, its
olive leaf plucked off. I found neither address nor name, only these
words:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not my intention to take leave of you when I said good-by to
the rest, but I hoped to see you in classe. I was disappointed. The
interview is deferred. Be ready for me. Ere I sail, I must see you at
leisure, and speak with you at length. Be ready; my moments are
numbered, and, just now, monopolized; besides, I have a private
business on hand which I will not share with any, nor communicate--even
to you.--PAUL.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then it must be this evening: was he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) not to go on the
morrow? Yes; of that point I was certain. I had seen the date of his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>)
vessel's departure advertised. Oh! _I_ would be ready, but could that
longed-for meeting really be achieved? the time was so short, the
schemers seemed so watchful, so active, so hostile; the way of access
appeared strait as a gully, deep as a chasm--Apollyon straddled across
it, breathing flames. Could my Greatheart overcome? Could my guide
reach me?

<p/>Who might tell? Yet I began to take some courage, some comfort; it
seemed to me that I felt a pulse of his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) heart beating yet true to the
whole throb of mine.

<p/>I waited my champion. Apollyon came trailing his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) Hell behind him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>). I
think if Eternity held torment, its form would not be fiery rack, nor
its nature despair. I think that on a certain day amongst those days
which never dawned, and will not set, an angel entered Hades--stood,
shone, smiled, delivered a prophecy of conditional pardon, kindled a
doubtful hope of bliss to come, not now, but at a day and hour unlooked
for, revealed in his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) own glory and grandeur the height and compass of
his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) promise: spoke thus--then towering, became a star, and vanished
into his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) own Heaven. His (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) legacy was suspense--a worse boon than despair.

<p/>All that evening I waited, trusting in the dove-sent olive-leaf, yet in
the midst of my trust, terribly fearing. My fear pressed heavy. Cold
and peculiar, I knew it for the partner of a rarely-belied
presentiment. The first hours seemed long and slow; in spirit I clung
to the flying skirts of the last. They passed like drift cloud--like
the wrack scudding before a storm.

<p/>They passed. All the long, hot summer day burned away like a Yule-log;
the crimson of its close perished; I was left bent among the cool blue
shades, over the pale and ashen gleams of its night.

<p/>Prayers were over; it was bed-time; my co-inmates were all retired. I
still remained in the gloomy first classe, forgetting, or at least
disregarding, rules I had never forgotten or disregarded before.

<p/>How long I paced that classe I cannot tell; I must have been afoot many
hours; mechanically had I moved aside benches and desks, and had made
for myself a path down its length. There I walked, and there, when
certain that the whole household were abed, and quite out of
hearing--there, I at last wept. Reliant on Night, confiding in
Solitude, I kept my tears sealed, my sobs chained, no longer; they
heaved my heart; they tore their way. In this house, what grief could
be sacred?

<p/>Soon after eleven o'clock--a very late hour in the Rue Fossette--the
door unclosed, quietly but not stealthily; a lamp's flame invaded the
moonlight; Madame Beck entered, with the same composed air, as if
coming on an ordinary occasion, at an ordinary season. Instead of at
once addressing me, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) desk, took her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) keys, and seemed to
seek something: she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) loitered over this feigned search long, too long.
She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was calm, too calm; my mood scarce endured the pretence; driven
beyond common range, two hours since I had left behind me wonted
respects and fears. Led by a touch, and ruled by a word, under usual
circumstances, no yoke could now be borne--no curb obeyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is more than time for retirement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame; <div class="bookquote">``the rule of the
house has already been transgressed too long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame met no answer: I did not check my walk; when she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) came in my way,
I put her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) out of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me persuade you to calm, Meess; let me lead you to your chamber,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), trying to speak softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; <div class="bookquote">``neither you nor another shall persuade or lead me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your bed shall be warmed. Goton is sitting up still. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) shall make
you comfortable: she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) shall give you a sedative.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I broke out, <div class="bookquote">``you are a sensualist. Under all your serenity,
your peace, and your decorum, you are an undenied sensualist. Make your
own bed warm and soft; take sedatives and meats, and drinks spiced and
sweet, as much as you will. If you have any sorrow or
disappointment--and, perhaps, you have--nay, I _know_ you have--seek
your own palliatives, in your own chosen resources. Leave me, however.
_Leave me_, I say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must send another to watch you, Meess: I must send Goton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forbid it. Let me alone. Keep your hand off me, and my life, and my
troubles. Oh, Madame! in _your_ hand there is both chill and poison.
You envenom and you paralyze.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I done, Meess? You must not marry Paul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cannot marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dog in the manger!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said: for I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) secretly wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and
had always wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``insupportable:''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) railed at
him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for a <div class="bookquote">``dévot:''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) did not love, but she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) wanted to marry, that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
might bind him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) interest. Deep into some of Madame's secrets I
had entered--I know not how: by an intuition or an inspiration which
came to me--I know not whence. In the course of living with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) too, I
had slowly learned, that, unless with an inferior, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) must ever be a
rival. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was _my_ rival, heart and soul, though secretly, under the
smoothest bearing, and utterly unknown to all save her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) and myself.

<p/>Two minutes I stood over Madame, feeling that the whole woman was in my
power, because in some moods, such as the present--in some stimulated
states of perception, like that of this instant--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) habitual disguise,
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mask and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) domino, were to me a mere network reticulated with
holes; and I saw underneath a being heartless, self-indulgent, and
ignoble. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quietly retreated from me: meek and self-possessed, though
very uneasy, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``If I would not be persuaded to take rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
must reluctantly leave me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did incontinent, perhaps even
more glad to get away, than I was to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vanish.

<p/>This was the sole flash-eliciting, truth-extorting, rencontre which
ever occurred between me and Madame Beck: this short night-scene was
never repeated. It did not one whit change her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manner to me. I do not
know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) revenged it. I do not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hated me the worse
for my fell candour. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bucklered herself with the secret
philosophy of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strong mind, and resolved to forget what it irked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
to remember. I know that to the end of our mutual lives there occurred
no repetition of, no allusion to, that fiery passage.

<p/>That night passed: all nights--even the starless night before
dissolution--must wear away. About six o'clock, the hour which called
up the household, I went out to the court, and washed my face in its
cold, fresh well-water. Entering by the carré, a piece of mirror-glass,
set in an oaken cabinet, repeated my image. It said I was changed: my
cheeks and lips were sodden white, my eyes were glassy, and my eyelids
swollen and purple.

<p/>On rejoining my companions, I knew they all looked at me--my heart
seemed discovered to them: I believed myself self-betrayed. Hideously
certain did it seem that the very youngest of the school must guess why
and for whom I despaired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isabelle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child whom I had once nursed in sickness, approached
me. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), too, mock me!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Que vous êtes pâle! Vous êtes donc bien malade, Mademoiselle!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), putting her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) finger in her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) mouth, and staring with a wistful
stupidity which at the moment seemed to me more beautiful than the
keenest intelligence.

<p/>Isabelle did not long stand alone in the recommendation of ignorance:
before the day was over, I gathered cause of gratitude towards the
whole blind household. The multitude have something else to do than to
read hearts and interpret dark sayings. Who wills, may keep his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) own
counsel--be his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) own secret's sovereign. In the course of that day,
proof met me on proof, not only that the cause of my present sorrow was
unguessed, but that my whole inner life for the last six months, was
still mine only. It was not known--it had not been noted--that I held
in peculiar value one life among all lives. Gossip had passed me by;
curiosity had looked me over; both subtle influences, hovering always
round, had never become centred upon me. A given organization may live
in a full fever-hospital, and escape typhus. M. Emanuel had come and
gone: I had been taught and sought; in season and out of season he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had
called me, and I had obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``M. Paul wants Miss Lucy'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Miss Lucy
is with M. Paul'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--such had been the perpetual bulletin; and nobody
commented, far less condemned. Nobody hinted, nobody jested. Madame
Beck read the riddle: none else resolved it. What I now suffered was
called illness--a headache: I accepted the baptism.

<p/>But what bodily illness was ever like this pain? This certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)
was gone without a farewell--this cruel conviction that fate and
pursuing furies--a woman's envy and a priest's bigotry--would suffer me
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) no more? What wonder that the second evening found me like
the first--untamed, tortured, again pacing a solitary room in an
unalterable passion of silent desolation?

<p/>Madame Beck did not herself summon me to bed that night--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not
come near me: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sent Ginevra Fanshawe--a more efficient agent for the
purpose she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not have employed. Ginevra's first words--<div class="bookquote">``Is your
headache very bad to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginevra/Miss Fanshawe/Ginevra Fanshawe</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for Ginevra, like the rest, thought I had
a headache--an intolerable headache which made me frightfully white in
the face, and insanely restless in the foot-RRB---her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) first words, I say,
inspired the impulse to flee anywhere, so that it were only out of
reach. And soon, what followed--plaints about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) own
headaches--completed the business.

<p/>I went up-stairs. Presently I was in my bed--my miserable bed--haunted
with quick scorpions. I had not been laid down five minutes, when
another emissary arrived: Goton came, bringing me something to drink. I
was consumed with thirst--I drank eagerly; the beverage was sweet, but
I tasted a drug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame says it will make you sleep, chou-chou,''  (<font color='red'><b>Goton</b></font>)</div>said Goton, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>)
received back the emptied cup.

<p/>Ah! the sedative had been administered. In fact, they had given me a
strong opiate. I was to be held quiet for one night.

<p/>The household came to bed, the night-light was lit, the dormitory
hushed. Sleep soon reigned: over those pillows, sleep won an easy
supremacy: contented sovereign over heads and hearts which did not
ache--he (<font color='blue'><b>Goton</b></font>) passed by the unquiet.

<p/>The drug wrought. I know not whether Madame had overcharged or
under-charged the dose; its result was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) intended. Instead
of stupor, came excitement. I became alive to new thought--to reverie
peculiar in colouring. A gathering call ran among the faculties, their
bugles sang, their trumpets rang an untimely summons. Imagination was
roused from her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) rest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came forth impetuous and venturous. With
scorn she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) looked on Matter, her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) mate--<div class="bookquote">``Rise!''  (<font color='red'><b>mate Rise</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Sluggard! this
night I will have _my_ will; nor shalt thou prevail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look forth and view the night!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) cry; and when I lifted the
heavy blind from the casement close at hand--with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own royal
gesture, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) showed me a moon supreme, in an element deep and splendid.

<p/>To my gasping senses she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) made the glimmering gloom, the narrow limits,
the oppressive heat of the dormitory, intolerable. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) lured me to
leave this den and follow her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) forth into dew, coolness, and glory.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) brought upon me a strange vision of Villette at midnight.
Especially she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) showed the park, the summer-park, with its long alleys
all silent, lone and safe; among these lay a huge stone basin--that
basin I knew, and beside which I had often stood--deep-set in the
tree-shadows, brimming with cool water, clear, with a green, leafy,
rushy bed. What of all this? The park-gates were shut up, locked,
sentinelled: the place could not be entered.

<p/>Could it not? A point worth considering; and while revolving it, I
mechanically dressed. Utterly incapable of sleeping or lying
still--excited from head to foot--what could I do better than dress?

<p/>The gates were locked, soldiers set before them: was there, then, no
admission to the park?

<p/>The other day, in walking past, I had seen, without then attending to
the circumstance, a gap in the paling--one stake broken down: I now saw
this gap again in recollection--saw it very plainly--the narrow,
irregular aperture visible between the stems of the lindens, planted
orderly as a colonnade. A man could not have made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way through that
aperture, nor could a stout woman, perhaps not Madame Beck; but I
thought I might: I fancied I should like to try, and once within, at
this hour the whole park would be mine--the moonlight, midnight park!

<p/>How soundly the dormitory slept! What deep slumbers! What quiet
breathing! How very still the whole large house! What was the time? I
felt restless to know. There stood a clock in the classe below: what
hindered me from venturing down to consult it? By such a moon, its
large white face and jet black figures must be vividly distinct.

<p/>As for hindrance to this step, there offered not so much as a creaking
hinge or a clicking latch. On these hot July nights, close air could
not be tolerated, and the chamber-door stood wide open. Will the
dormitory-planks sustain my tread untraitorous? Yes. I know wherever a
board is loose, and will avoid it. The oak staircase creaks somewhat as
I descend, but not much:--I am in the carré.

<p/>The great classe-doors are close shut: they are bolted. On the other
hand, the entrance to the corridor stands open. The classes seem to my
thought, great dreary jails, buried far back beyond thoroughfares, and
for me, filled with spectral and intolerable Memories, laid miserable
amongst their straw and their manacles. The corridor offers a cheerful
vista, leading to the high vestibule which opens direct upon the street.

<p/>Hush!--the clock strikes. Ghostly deep as is the stillness of this
convent, it is only eleven. While my ear follows to silence the hum of
the last stroke, I catch faintly from the built-out capital, a sound
like bells or like a band--a sound where sweetness, where victory,
where mourning blend. Oh, to approach this music nearer, to listen to
it alone by the rushy basin! Let me go--oh, let me go! What hinders,
what does not aid freedom?

<p/>There, in the corridor, hangs my garden-costume, my large hat, my
shawl. There is no lock on the huge, heavy, porte-cochère; there is no
key to seek: it fastens with a sort of spring-bolt, not to be opened
from the outside, but which, from within, may be noiselessly withdrawn.
Can I manage it? It yields to my hand, yields with propitious facility.
I wonder as that portal seems almost spontaneously to unclose--I wonder
as I cross the threshold and step on the paved street, wonder at the
strange ease with which this prison has been forced. It seems as if I
had been pioneered invisibly, as if some dissolving force had gone
before me: for myself, I have scarce made an effort.

<p/>Quiet Rue Fossette! I find on this pavement that wanderer-wooing summer
night of which I mused; I see its moon over me; I feel its dew in the
air. But here I cannot stay; I am still too near old haunts: so close
under the dungeon, I can hear the prisoners moan. This solemn peace is
not what I seek, it is not what I can bear: to me the face of that sky
bears the aspect of a world's death. The park also will be calm--I
know, a mortal serenity prevails everywhere--yet let me seek the park.

<p/>I took a route well known, and went up towards the palatial and royal
Haute-Ville; thence the music I had heard certainly floated; it was
hushed now, but it might re-waken. I went on: neither band nor bell
music came to meet me; another sound replaced it, a sound like a strong
tide, a great flow, deepening as I proceeded. Light broke, movement
gathered, chimes pealed--to what was I coming? Entering on the level of
a Grande Place, I found myself, with the suddenness of magic, plunged
amidst a gay, living, joyous crowd.

<p/>Villette is one blaze, one broad illumination; the whole world seems
abroad; moonlight and heaven are banished: the town, by her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own
flambeaux, beholds her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own splendour--gay dresses, grand equipages,
fine horses and gallant riders throng the bright streets. I see even
scores of masks. It is a strange scene, stranger than dreams. But where
is the park?--I ought to be near it. In the midst of this glare the
park must be shadowy and calm--_there_, at least, are neither torches,
lamps, nor crowd?

<p/>I was asking this question when an open carriage passed me filled with
known faces. Through the deep throng it could pass but slowly; the
spirited horses fretted in their curbed ardour. I saw the occupants of
that carriage well: me they could not see, or, at least, not know,
folded close in my large shawl, screened with my straw hat -LRB-in that
motley crowd no dress was noticeably strange-RRB-. I saw the Count de
Bassompierre; I saw my godmother, handsomely apparelled, comely and
cheerful; I saw, too, Paulina Mary, compassed with the triple halo of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) beauty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) youth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) happiness. In looking on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) countenance
of joy, and eyes of festal light, one scarce remembered to note the
gala elegance of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wore; I know only that the drapery floating
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was all white and light and bridal; seated opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) I
saw Graham Bretton; it was in looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aspect had caught
its lustre--the light repeated in _her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)_ eyes beamed first out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bretton</b></font>).

<p/>It gave me strange pleasure to follow these friends viewlessly, and I
_did_ follow them, as I thought, to the park. I watched them alight
-LRB-carriages were inadmissible-RRB- amidst new and unanticipated splendours.
Lo! the iron gateway, between the stone columns, was spanned by a
flaming arch built of massed stars; and, following them cautiously
beneath that arch, where were they, and where was I?

<p/>In a land of enchantment, a garden most gorgeous, a plain sprinkled
with coloured meteors, a forest with sparks of purple and ruby and
golden fire gemming the foliage; a region, not of trees and shadow, but
of strangest architectural wealth--of altar and of temple, of pyramid,
obelisk, and sphinx: incredible to say, the wonders and the symbols of
Egypt teemed throughout the park of Villette.

<p/>No matter that in five minutes the secret was mine--the key of the
mystery picked up, and its illusion unveiled--no matter that I quickly
recognised the material of these solemn fragments--the timber, the
paint, and the pasteboard--these inevitable discoveries failed to quite
destroy the charm, or undermine the marvel of that night. No matter
that I now seized the explanation of the whole great fête--a fête of
which the conventual Rue Fossette had not tasted, though it had opened
at dawn that morning, and was still in full vigour near midnight.

<p/>In past days there had been, said history, an awful crisis in the fate
of Labassecour, involving I know not what peril to the rights and
liberties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>) gallant citizens. Rumours of wars there had been, if
not wars themselves; a kind of struggling in the streets--a bustle--a
running to and fro, some rearing of barricades, some burgher-rioting,
some calling out of troops, much interchange of brickbats, and even a
little of shot. Tradition held that patriots had fallen: in the old
Basse-Ville was shown an enclosure, solemnly built in and set apart,
holding, it was said, the sacred bones of martyrs. Be this as it may, a
certain day in the year was still kept as a festival in honour of the
said patriots and martyrs of somewhat apocryphal memory--the morning
being given to a solemn Te Deum in St. Jean Baptiste, the evening
devoted to spectacles, decorations, and illuminations, such as these I
now saw.

<p/>While looking up at the image of a white ibis, fixed on a column--while
fathoming the deep, torch-lit perspective of an avenue, at the close of
which was couched a sphinx--I lost sight of the party which, from the
middle of the great square, I had followed--or, rather, they vanished
like a group of apparitions. On this whole scene was impressed a
dream-like character: every shape was wavering, every movement
floating, every voice echo-like--half-mocking, half-uncertain. Paulina
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) friends being gone, I scarce could avouch that I had really
seen them; nor did I miss them as guides through the chaos, far less
regret them as protectors amidst the night.

<p/>That festal night would have been safe for a very child. Half the
peasantry had come in from the outlying environs of Villette, and the
decent burghers were all abroad and around, dressed in their best. My
straw-hat passed amidst cap and jacket, short petticoat, and long
calico mantle, without, perhaps, attracting a glance; I only took the
precaution to bind down the broad leaf gipsy-wise, with a supplementary
ribbon--and then I felt safe as if masked.

<p/>Safe I passed down the avenues--safe I mixed with the crowd where it
was deepest. To be still was not in my power, nor quietly to observe. I
took a revel of the scene; I drank the elastic night-air--the swell of
sound, the dubious light, now flashing, now fading. As to Happiness or
Hope, they and I had shaken hands, but just now--I scorned Despair.

<p/>My vague aim, as I went, was to find the stone-basin, with its clear
depth and green lining: of that coolness and verdure I thought, with
the passionate thirst of unconscious fever. Amidst the glare, and
hurry, and throng, and noise, I still secretly and chiefly longed to
come on that circular mirror of crystal, and surprise the moon glassing
therein her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) pearly front.

<p/>I knew my route, yet it seemed as if I was hindered from pursuing it
direct: now a sight, and now a sound, called me aside, luring me down
this alley and down that. Already I saw the thick-planted trees which
framed this tremulous and rippled glass, when, choiring out of a glade
to the right, broke such a sound as I thought might be heard if Heaven
were to open--such a sound, perhaps, as _was_ heard above the plain of
Bethlehem, on the night of glad tidings.

<p/>The song, the sweet music, rose afar, but rushing swiftly on
fast-strengthening pinions--there swept through these shades so full a
storm of harmonies that, had no tree been near against which to lean, I
think I must have dropped. Voices were there, it seemed to me,
unnumbered; instruments varied and countless--bugle, horn, and trumpet
I knew. The effect was as a sea breaking into song with all its waves.

<p/>The swaying tide swept this way, and then it fell back, and I followed
its retreat. It led me towards a Byzantine building--a sort of kiosk
near the park's centre. Round about stood crowded thousands, gathered
to a grand concert in the open air. What I had heard was, I think, a
wild Jäger chorus; the night, the space, the scene, and my own mood,
had but enhanced the sounds and their impression.

<p/>Here were assembled ladies, looking by this light most beautiful: some
of their dresses were gauzy, and some had the sheen of satin, the
flowers and the blond trembled, and the veils waved about their
decorated bonnets, as that host-like chorus, with its greatly-gathering
sound, sundered the air above them. Most of these ladies occupied the
little light park-chairs, and behind and beside them stood guardian
gentlemen. The outer ranks of the crowd were made up of citizens,
plebeians and police.

<p/>In this outer rank I took my place. I rather liked to find myself the
silent, unknown, consequently unaccosted neighbour of the short
petticoat and the sabot; and only the distant gazer at the silk robe,
the velvet mantle, and the plumed chapeau. Amidst so much life and joy,
too, it suited me to be alone--quite alone. Having neither wish nor
power to force my way through a mass so close-packed, my station was on
the farthest confines, where, indeed, I might hear, but could see
little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle is not well placed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice at my elbow. Who dared
accost _me_, a being in a mood so little social? I turned, rather to
repel than to reply. I saw a man--a burgher--an entire stranger, as I
deemed him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) for one moment, but the next, recognised in him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) a certain
tradesman--a bookseller, whose shop furnished the Rue Fossette with its
books and stationery; a man notorious in our pensionnat for the
excessive brittleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temper, and frequent snappishness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
manner, even to us, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) principal customers: but whom, for my solitary
self, I had ever been disposed to like, and had always found civil,
sometimes kind; once, in aiding me about some troublesome little
exchange of foreign money, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done me a service. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an
intelligent man; under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asperity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a good-hearted man; the
thought had sometimes crossed me, that a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature bore
affinity to a part of M. Emanuel's -LRB-whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) knew well, and whom I had
often seen sitting on Miret's counter, turning over the current month's
publications-RRB-; and it was in this affinity I read the explanation of
that conciliatory feeling with which I instinctively regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>).

<p/>Strange to say, this man knew me under my straw-hat and closely-folded
shawl; and, though I deprecated the effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insisted on making a way
for me through the crowd, and finding me a better situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disinterested civility further; and, from some quarter, procured me
a chair. Once and again, I have found that the most cross-grained are
by no means the worst of mankind; nor the humblest in station, the
least polished in feeling. This man, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) courtesy, seemed to find
nothing strange in my being here alone; only a reason for extending to
me, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, a retiring, yet efficient attention. Having
secured me a place and a seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) withdrew without asking a question,
without obtruding a remark, without adding a superfluous word. No
wonder that Professor Emanuel liked to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) cigar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lounge,
and to read his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) feuilleton in M. Miret's shop--the two must have suited.

<p/>I had not been seated five minutes, ere I became aware that chance and
my worthy burgher friend had brought me once more within view of a
familiar and domestic group. Right before me sat the Brettons and de
Bassompierres. Within reach of my hand--had I chosen to extend it--sat
a figure like a fairy-queen, whose array, lilies and their leaves
seemed to have suggested; whatever was not spotless white, being
forest-green. My godmother, too, sat so near, that, had I leaned
forward, my breath might have stirred the ribbon of her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) bonnet. They
were too near; having been just recognised by a comparative stranger, I
felt uneasy at this close vicinage of intimate acquaintance.

<p/>It made me quite start when Mrs. Bretton, turning to Mr. Home, and
speaking out of a kind impulse of memory, said,--<div class="bookquote">``I wonder what my
steady little Lucy would say to all this if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) were here? I wish we
had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have enjoyed it much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Home</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) grave sensible fashion; it is a
pity but we had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the kind gentleman</b></font>)</div>rejoined the kind gentleman; and added, <div class="bookquote">``I
like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) so quietly pleased; so little moved, yet so content.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the kind gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Dear were they both to me, dear are they to this day in their
remembered benevolence. Little knew they the rack of pain which had
driven Lucy almost into fever, and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) out, guideless and
reckless, urged and drugged to the brink of frenzy. I had half a mind
to bend over the elders' shoulders, and answer their goodness with the
thanks of my eyes. M. de Bassompierre did not well know _me_, but I
knew _him (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)_, and honoured and admired his (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>) nature, with all its plain
sincerity, its warm affection, and unconscious enthusiasm. Possibly I
might have spoken, but just then Graham turned; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) turned with one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) stately firm movements, so different from those, of a
sharp-tempered under-sized man: there was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a throng, a
hundred ranks deep; there were thousands to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye and divide its
scrutiny--why then did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) concentrate all on me--oppressing me with the
whole force of that full, blue, steadfast orb? Why, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _would_ look,
did not one glance satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turn on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair, rest his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
elbow on its back, and study me leisurely? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not see my face, I
held it down; surely, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _could_ not recognise me: I stooped, I turned,
I _would_ not be known. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose, by some means he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contrived to
approach, in two minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have had my secret: my identity would
have been grasped between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), never tyrannous, but always powerful
hands. There was but one way to evade or to check him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I implied, by a
sort of supplicatory gesture, that it was my prayer to be let alone;
after that, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) persisted, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would perhaps have seen the spectacle
of Lucy incensed: not all that was grand, or good, or kind in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -LRB-and
Lucy felt the full amount-RRB- should have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) quite tame, or
absolutely inoffensive and shadowlike. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desisted. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handsome head, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was mute. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat, nor did
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again turn or disturb me by a glance, except indeed for one single
instant, when a look, rather solicitous than curious, stole my
way--speaking what somehow stilled my heart like <div class="bookquote">``the south-wind
quieting the earth.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Graham's thoughts of me were not entirely those of
a frozen indifference, after all. I believe in that goodly mansion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) kept one little place under the sky-lights where Lucy might
have entertainment, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) chose to call. It was not so handsome as the
chambers where he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) lodged his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) male friends; it was not like the hall
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) accommodated his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) philanthropy, or the library where he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
treasured his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) science, still less did it resemble the pavilion where
his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) marriage feast was splendidly spread; yet, gradually, by long and
equal kindness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) proved to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) kept one little closet, over
the door of which was written <div class="bookquote">``Lucy's Room.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I kept a place for him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>),
too--a place of which I never took the measure, either by rule or
compass: I think it was like the tent of Peri-Banou. All my life long I
carried it folded in the hollow of my hand yet, released from that hold
and constriction, I know not but its innate capacity for expanse might
have magnified it into a tabernacle for a host.

<p/>Forbearing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was to-night, I could not stay in this proximity; this
dangerous place and seat must be given up: I watched my opportunity,
rose, and stole away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) might think, he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) might even believe that Lucy
was contained within that shawl, and sheltered under that hat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) never
could be certain, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) did not see my face.

<p/>Surely the spirit of restlessness was by this time appeased? Had I not
had enough of adventure? Did I not begin to flag, quail, and wish for
safety under a roof? Not so. I still loathed my bed in the school
dormitory more than words can express: I clung to whatever could
distract thought. Somehow I felt, too, that the night's drama was but
begun, that the prologue was scarce spoken: throughout this woody and
turfy theatre reigned a shadow of mystery; actors and incidents
unlooked-for, waited behind the scenes: I thought so foreboding told me
as much.

<p/>Straying at random, obeying the push of every chance elbow, I was
brought to a quarter where trees planted in clusters, or towering
singly, broke up somewhat the dense packing of the crowd, and gave it a
more scattered character. These confines were far from the music, and
somewhat aloof even from the lamps, but there was sound enough to
soothe, and with that full, high moon, lamps were scarce needed. Here
had chiefly settled family-groups, burgher-parents; some of them, late
as was the hour, actually surrounded by their children, with whom it
had not been thought advisable to venture into the closer throng.

<p/>Three fine tall trees growing close, almost twined stem within stem,
lifted a thick canopy of shade above a green knoll, crowned with a
seat--a seat which might have held several, yet it seemed abandoned to
one, the remaining members of the fortunate party in possession of this
site standing dutifully round; yet, amongst this reverend circle was a
lady, holding by the hand a little girl.

<p/>When I caught sight of this little girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was twisting herself round
on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heel, swinging from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) conductress's hand, flinging herself
from side to side with wanton and fantastic gyrations. These perverse
movements arrested my attention, they struck me as of a character
fearfully familiar. On close inspection, no less so appeared the
child's equipment; the lilac silk pelisse, the small swansdown boa, the
white bonnet--the whole holiday toilette, in short, was the gala garb
of a cherub but too well known, of that tadpole, Désirée Beck--and
Désirée Beck it was--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or an imp in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) likeness.

<p/>I might have taken this discovery as a thunder-clap, but such hyperbole
would have been premature; discovery was destined to rise more than one
degree, ere it reached its climax.

<p/>On whose hand could the amiable Désirée swing thus selfishly, whose
glove could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tear thus recklessly, whose arm thus strain with
impunity, or on the borders of whose dress thus turn and trample
insolently, if not the hand, glove, arm, and robe of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lady-mother?
And there, in an Indian shawl and a pale-green crape bonnet--there,
fresh, portly, blithe, and pleasant--there stood Madame Beck.

<p/>Curious! I had certainly deemed Madame in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bed, and Désirée in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
crib, at this blessed minute, sleeping, both of them, the sleep of the
just, within the sacred walls, amidst the profound seclusion of the Rue
Fossette. Most certainly also they did not picture <div class="bookquote">``Meess Lucie''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>otherwise engaged; and here we all three were taking our <div class="bookquote">''ébats''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in the
fête-blazing park at midnight!

<p/>The fact was, Madame was only acting according to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quite justifiable
wont. I remembered now I had heard it said among the teachers--though
without at the time particularly noticing the gossip--that often, when
we thought Madame in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chamber, sleeping, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was gone, full-dressed,
to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pleasure at operas, or plays, or balls. Madame had no sort
of taste for a monastic life, and took care--largely, though
discreetly--to season her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) existence with a relish of the world.

<p/>Half a dozen gentlemen of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends stood about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Amongst these, I
was not slow to recognise two or three. There was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brother, M.
Victor Kint; there was another person, moustached and with long hair--a
calm, taciturn man, but whose traits bore a stamp and a semblance I
could not mark unmoved. Amidst reserve and phlegm, amidst contrasts of
character and of countenance, something there still was which recalled
a face--mobile, fervent, feeling--a face changeable, now clouded, and
now alight--a face from my world taken away, for my eyes lost, but
where my best spring-hours of life had alternated in shadow and in
glow; that face, where I had often seen movements so near the signs of
genius--that why there did not shine fully out the undoubted fire, the
thing, the spirit, and the secret itself--I could never tell. Yes--this
Josef Emanuel--this man of peace--reminded me of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) ardent brother.

<p/>Besides Messieurs Victor and Josef, I knew another of this party. This
third person stood behind and in the shade, his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) attitude too was
stooping, yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) dress and bald white head made him (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) the most
conspicuous figure of the group. He (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) was an ecclesiastic: he (<font color='blue'><b>Josef</b></font>) was Père
Silas. Do not fancy, reader, that there was any inconsistency in the
priest's presence at this fête. This was not considered a show of
Vanity Fair, but a commemoration of patriotic sacrifice. The Church
patronised it, even with ostentation. There were troops of priests in
the park that night.

<p/>Père Silas stooped over the seat with its single occupant, the rustic
bench and that which sat upon it: a strange mass it was--bearing no
shape, yet magnificent. You saw, indeed, the outline of a face, and
features, but these were so cadaverous and so strangely placed, you
could almost have fancied a head severed from its trunk, and flung at
random on a pile of rich merchandise. The distant lamp-rays glanced on
clear pendants, on broad rings; neither the chasteness of moonlight,
nor the distance of the torches, could quite subdue the gorgeous dyes
of the drapery. Hail, Madame Walravens! I think you looked more
witch-like than ever. And presently the good lady proved that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
indeed no corpse or ghost, but a harsh and hardy old woman; for, upon
some aggravation in the clamorous petition of Désirée Beck to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
mother, to go to the kiosk and take sweetmeats, the hunchback suddenly
fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a resounding rap with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gold-knobbed cane.

<p/>There, then, were Madame Walravens, Madame Beck, Père Silas--the whole
conjuration, the secret junta. The sight of them thus assembled did me
good. I cannot say that I felt weak before them, or abashed, or
dismayed. They outnumbered me, and I was worsted and under their feet;
but, as yet, I was not dead.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX.

<p/>OLD AND NEW ACQUAINTANCE.


<p/>Fascinated as by a basilisk with three heads, I could not leave this
clique; the ground near them seemed to hold my feet. The canopy of
entwined trees held out shadow, the night whispered a pledge of
protection, and an officious lamp flashed just one beam to show me an
obscure, safe seat, and then vanished. Let me now briefly tell the
reader all that, during the past dark fortnight, I have been silently
gathering from Rumour, respecting the origin and the object of M.
Emanuel's departure. The tale is short, and not new: its alpha is
Mammon, and its omega Interest.

<p/>If Madame Walravens was hideous as a Hindoo idol, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) seemed also to
possess, in the estimation of these her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) votaries, an idol's
consequence. The fact was, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had been rich--very rich; and though,
for the present, without the command of money, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was likely one day
to be rich again. At Basseterre, in Guadaloupe, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) possessed a large
estate, received in dowry on her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) marriage sixty years ago, sequestered
since her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) husband's failure; but now, it was supposed, cleared of
claim, and, if duly looked after by a competent agent of integrity,
considered capable of being made, in a few years, largely productive.

<p/>Père Silas took an interest in this prospective improvement for the
sake of religion and the church, whereof Magliore Walravens was a
devout daughter. Madame Beck, distantly related to the hunchback and
knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to be without family of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own, had long brooded over
contingencies with a mother's calculating forethought, and, harshly
treated as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was by Madame Walravens, never ceased to court her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) for
interest's sake. Madame Beck and the priest were thus, for money
reasons, equally and sincerely interested in the nursing of the West
Indian estate.

<p/>But the distance was great, and the climate hazardous. The competent
and upright agent wanted, must be a devoted man. Just such a man had
Madame Walravens retained for twenty years in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) service, blighting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walravens</b></font>) life, and then living on him (<font color='blue'><b>Walravens</b></font>), like an old fungus; such a man had
Père Silas trained, taught, and bound to him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) by the ties of gratitude,
habit, and belief. Such a man Madame Beck knew, and could in some
measure influence. <div class="bookquote">``My pupil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Père Silas/Silas</b></font>)</div>said Père Silas, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) remains in
Europe, runs risk of apostacy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) has become entangled with a
heretic.''  (<font color='red'><b>Père Silas/Silas</b></font>)</div>Madame Beck made also her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) private comment, and preferred in
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own breast her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) secret reason for desiring expatriation. The thing
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not obtain, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) desired not another to win: rather would she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
destroy it. As to Madame Walravens, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) money and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) land,
and knew Paul, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) liked, could make the best and faithfullest
steward: so the three self-seekers banded and beset the one unselfish.
They reasoned, they appealed, they implored; on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mercy they cast
themselves, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands they confidingly thrust their interests.
They asked but two or three years of devotion--after that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) should
live for himself: one of the number, perhaps, wished that in the
meantime he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) might die.

<p/>No living being ever humbly laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) advantage at M. Emanuel's feet, or
confidingly put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hands, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spurned the trust or
repulsed the repository. What might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) private pain or inward
reluctance to leave Europe--what his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) calculations for his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own
future--none asked, or knew, or reported. All this was a blank to me.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) conferences with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) confessor I might guess; the part duty and
religion were made to play in the persuasions used, I might conjecture.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was gone, and had made no sign. There my knowledge closed.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>With my head bent, and my forehead resting on my hands, I sat amidst
grouped tree-stems and branching brushwood. Whatever talk passed
amongst my neighbours, I might hear, if I would; I was near enough; but
for some time, there was scarce motive to attend. They gossiped about
the dresses, the music, the illuminations, the fine night. I listened
to hear them say, <div class="bookquote">``It is calm weather for _his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)_ voyage; the _Antigua_''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ship-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``will sail prosperously.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>No such remark fell; neither the
_Antigua_, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) course, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) passenger were named.

<p/>Perhaps the light chat scarcely interested old Madame Walravens more
than it did me; she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) appeared restless, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head now to this
side, now that, looking through the trees, and among the crowd, as if
expectant of an arrival and impatient of delay. <div class="bookquote">``Où sont-ils? Pourquoi
ne viennent-ils?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mutter more than once; and at last, as if
determined to have an answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) question--which hitherto none
seemed to mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spoke aloud this phrase--a phrase brief enough,
simple enough, but it sent a shock through me--<div class="bookquote">``Messieurs et mesdames,''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``où donc est Justine Marie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Justine Marie!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What was this? Justine Marie--the dead nun--where was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)? Why, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) grave, Madame Walravens--what can you want with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)?
You shall go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) shall not come to you.

<p/>Thus _I_ should have answered, had the response lain with me, but
nobody seemed to be of my mind; nobody seemed surprised, startled, or
at a loss. The quietest commonplace answer met the strange, the
dead-disturbing, the Witch-of-Endor query of the hunchback.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Justine Marie,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one, <div class="bookquote">``is coming; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is in the kiosk; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) will be
here presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Out of this question and reply sprang a change in the chat--chat it
still remained, easy, desultory, familiar gossip. Hint, allusion,
comment, went round the circle, but all so broken, so dependent on
references to persons not named, or circumstances not defined, that
listen as intently as I would--and I _did_ listen _now_ with a fated
interest--I could make out no more than that some scheme was on foot,
in which this ghostly Justine Marie--dead or alive--was concerned. This
family-junta seemed grasping at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) somehow, for some reason; there
seemed question of a marriage, of a fortune--for whom I could not quite
make out--perhaps for Victor Kint, perhaps for Josef Emanuel--both were
bachelors. Once I thought the hints and jests rained upon a young
fair-haired foreigner of the party, whom they called Heinrich Mühler.
Amidst all the badinage, Madame Walravens still obtruded from time to
time, hoarse, cross-grained speeches; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) impatience being diverted
only by an implacable surveillance of Désirée, who could not stir but
the old woman menaced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) staff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``La voilà!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>suddenly cried one of the gentlemen, <div class="bookquote">``voilà Justine Marie
qui arrive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>This moment was for me peculiar. I called up to memory the pictured nun
on the panel; present to my mind was the sad love-story; I saw in
thought the vision of the garret, the apparition of the alley, the
strange birth of the berceau; I underwent a presentiment of discovery,
a strong conviction of coming disclosure. Ah! when imagination once
runs riot where do we stop? What winter tree so bare and
branchless--what way-side, hedge-munching animal so humble, that Fancy,
a passing cloud, and a struggling moonbeam, will not clothe it in
spirituality, and make of it a phantom?

<p/>With solemn force pressed on my heart, the expectation of mystery
breaking up: hitherto I had seen this spectre only through a glass
darkly; now was I to behold it face to face. I leaned forward; I looked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) comes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Josef Emanuel/M. Josef Emanuel/Josef</b></font>)</div>cried Josef Emanuel.

<p/>The circle opened as if opening to admit a new and welcome member. At
this instant a torch chanced to be carried past; its blaze aided the
pale moon in doing justice to the crisis, in lighting to perfection the
dénouement pressing on. Surely those near me must have felt some little
of the anxiety I felt, in degree so unmeted. Of that group the coolest
must have <div class="bookquote">``held his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) breath for a time!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>As for me, my life stood still.

<p/>It is over. The moment and the nun are come. The crisis and the
revelation are passed by.

<p/>The flambeau glares still within a yard, held up in a park-keeper's
hand; its long eager tongue of flame almost licks the figure of the
Expected--there--where she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) stands full in my sight. What is she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) like?
What does she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) wear? How does she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) look? Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>)?

<p/>There are many masks in the park to-night, and as the hour wears late,
so strange a feeling of revelry and mystery begins to spread abroad,
that scarce would you discredit me, reader, were I to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) is
like the nun of the attic, that she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) wears black skirts and white
head-clothes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) looks the resurrection of the flesh, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) is a risen ghost.

<p/>All falsities--all figments! We will not deal in this gear. Let us be
honest, and cut, as heretofore, from the homely web of truth.

<p/>_Homely_, though, is an ill-chosen word. What I see is not precisely
homely. A girl of Villette stands there--a girl fresh from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
pensionnat. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is very comely, with the beauty indigenous to this
country. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks well-nourished, fair, and fat of flesh. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheeks
are round, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes good; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair is abundant. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is handsomely
dressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not alone; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) escort consists of three persons--two
being elderly; these she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) addresses as <div class="bookquote">``Mon Oncle''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Ma Tante.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
laughs, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chats; good-humoured, buxom, and blooming, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks, at
all points, the bourgeoise belle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much for Justine Marie;''  (<font color='red'><b>ghosts mystery</b></font>)</div>so much for ghosts and mystery: not that
this last was solved--this girl certainly is not my nun: what I saw in
the garret and garden must have been taller by a span.

<p/>We have looked at the city belle; we have cursorily glanced at the
respectable old uncle and aunt. Have we a stray glance to give to the
third member of this company? Can we spare him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) a moment's notice? We
ought to distinguish him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) so far, reader; he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) has claims on us; we do not
now meet him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) for the first time. I clasped my hands very hard, and I
drew my breath very deep: I held in the cry, I devoured the
ejaculation, I forbade the start, I spoke and I stirred no more than a
stone; but I knew what I looked on; through the dimness left in my eyes
by many nights' weeping, I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>). They said he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was to sail by the
_Antigua_. Madame Beck said so. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lied, or she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had uttered what was
once truth, and failed to contradict it when it became false. The
_Antigua_ was gone, and there stood Paul Emanuel.

<p/>Was I glad? A huge load left me. Was it a fact to warrant joy? I know
not. Ask first what were the circumstances attendant on this respite?
How far did this delay concern _me?_ Were there not those whom it might
touch more nearly?

<p/>After all, who may this young girl, this Justine Marie, be? Not a
stranger, reader; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is known to me by sight; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) visits at the Rue
Fossette: she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is often of Madame Beck's Sunday parties. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is a
relation of both the Becks and Walravens; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) derives her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) baptismal
name from the sainted nun who would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) aunt had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lived;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) patronymic is Sauveur; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is an heiress and an orphan, and M.
Emanuel is her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) guardian; some say her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) godfather.

<p/>The family junta wish this heiress to be married to one of their
band--which is it? Vital question--which is it?

<p/>I felt very glad now, that the drug administered in the sweet draught
had filled me with a possession which made bed and chamber intolerable.
I always, through my whole life, liked to penetrate to the real truth;
I like seeking the goddess in her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) temple, and handling the veil, and
daring the dread glance. O Titaness among deities! the covered outline
of thine aspect sickens often through its uncertainty, but define to us
one trait, show us one lineament, clear in awful sincerity; we may gasp
in untold terror, but with that gasp we drink in a breath of thy
divinity; our heart shakes, and its currents sway like rivers lifted by
earthquake, but we have swallowed strength. To see and know the worst
is to take from Fear her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) main advantage.

<p/>The Walravens' party, augmented in numbers, now became very gay. The
gentlemen fetched refreshments from the kiosk, all sat down on the turf
under the trees; they drank healths and sentiments; they laughed, they
jested. M. Emanuel underwent some raillery, half good-humoured, half, I
thought, malicious, especially on Madame Beck's part. I soon gathered
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) voyage had been temporarily deferred of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) own will, without
the concurrence, even against the advice, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) friends; he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) had let
the _Antigua_ go, and had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) berth in the _Paul et Virginie_,
appointed to sail a fortnight later. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) reason for this resolve
which they teased him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) to assign, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) would only vaguely
indicate as <div class="bookquote">``the settlement of a little piece of business which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had
set his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heart upon.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What _was_ this business? Nobody knew. Yes, there
was one who seemed partly, at least, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) confidence; a meaning look
passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) and Justine Marie. <div class="bookquote">``La petite va m`aider--n'est-ce
pas?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>). The answer was prompt enough, God knows?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mais oui, je vous aiderai de tout mon coeur. Vous ferez de moi tout ce
que vous voudrez, mon parrain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And this dear <div class="bookquote">``parrain''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hand and lifted it to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) grateful
lips. Upon which demonstration, I saw the light-complexioned young
Teuton, Heinrich Mühler, grow restless, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mühler</b></font>) did not like it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mühler</b></font>)
even grumbled a few words, whereat M. Emanuel actually laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
face, and with the ruthless triumph of the assured conqueror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) drew
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) ward nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>).

<p/>M. Emanuel was indeed very joyous that night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) seemed not one whit
subdued by the change of scene and action impending. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was the true
life of the party; a little despotic, perhaps, determined to be chief
in mirth, as well as in labour, yet from moment to moment proving
indisputably his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) right of leadership. His (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was the wittiest word, the
pleasantest anecdote, the frankest laugh. Restlessly active, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) multiplied himself to wait on all; but oh! I saw which was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) favourite. I saw at whose feet he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lay on the turf, I saw whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
folded carefully from the night air, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) tended, watched, and
cherished as the apple of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Still, hint and raillery flew thick, and still I gathered that while M.
Paul should be absent, working for others, these others, not quite
ungrateful, would guard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) the treasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left in Europe. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
bring them an Indian fortune: they would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in return a young
bride and a rich inheritance. As for the saintly consecration, the vow
of constancy, that was forgotten: the blooming and charming Present
prevailed over the Past; and, at length, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nun was indeed buried.

<p/>Thus it must be. The revelation was indeed come. Presentiment had not
been mistaken in her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) impulse: there is a kind of presentiment which
never _is_ mistaken; it was I who had for a moment miscalculated; not
seeing the true bearing of the oracle, I had thought she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) muttered of
vision when, in truth, her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) prediction touched reality.

<p/>I might have paused longer upon what I saw; I might have deliberated
ere I drew inferences. Some, perhaps, would have held the premises
doubtful, the proofs insufficient; some slow sceptics would have
incredulously examined ere they conclusively accepted the project of a
marriage between a poor and unselfish man of forty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wealthy
ward of eighteen; but far from me such shifts and palliatives, far from
me such temporary evasion of the actual, such coward fleeing from the
dread, the swift-footed, the all-overtaking Fact, such feeble suspense
of submission to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) the sole sovereign, such paltering and faltering
resistance to the Power whose errand is to march conquering and to
conquer, such traitor defection from the TRUTH.

<p/>No. I hastened to accept the whole plan. I extended my grasp and took
it all in. I gathered it to me with a sort of rage of haste, and folded
it round me, as the soldier struck on the field folds his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) colours about
his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) breast. I invoked Conviction to nail upon me the certainty,
abhorred while embraced, to fix it with the strongest spikes her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
strongest strokes could drive; and when the iron had entered well my
soul, I stood up, as I thought, renovated.

<p/>In my infatuation, I said, <div class="bookquote">``Truth, you are a good mistress to your
faithful servants! While a Lie pressed me, how I suffered! Even when
the Falsehood was still sweet, still flattering to the fancy, and warm
to the feelings, it wasted me with hourly torment. The persuasion that
affection was won could not be divorced from the dread that, by another
turn of the wheel, it might be lost. Truth stripped away Falsehood, and
Flattery, and Expectancy, and here I stand--free!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing remained now but to take my freedom to my chamber, to carry it
with me to my bed and see what I could make of it. The play was not
yet, indeed, quite played out. I might have waited and watched longer
that love-scene under the trees, that sylvan courtship. Had there been
nothing of love in the demonstration, my Fancy in this hour was so
generous, so creative, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) could have modelled for it the most salient
lineaments, and given it the deepest life and highest colour of
passion. But I _would_ not look; I had fixed my resolve, but I would
not violate my nature. And then--something tore me so cruelly under my
shawl, something so dug into my side, a vulture so strong in beak and
talon, I must be alone to grapple with it. I think I never felt
jealousy till now. This was not like enduring the endearments of Dr.
John and Paulina, against which while I sealed my eyes and my ears,
while I withdrew thence my thoughts, my sense of harmony still
acknowledged in it a charm. This was an outrage. The love born of
beauty was not mine; I had nothing in common with it: I could not dare
to meddle with it, but another love, venturing diffidently into life
after long acquaintance, furnace-tried by pain, stamped by constancy,
consolidated by affection's pure and durable alloy, submitted by
intellect to intellect's own tests, and finally wrought up, by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own
process, to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own unflawed completeness, this Love that laughed at
Passion, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) fast frenzies and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hot and hurried extinction, in
_this_ Love I had a vested interest; and whatever tended either to its
culture or its destruction, I could not view impassibly.

<p/>I turned from the group of trees and the <div class="bookquote">``merrie companie''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in its
shade. Midnight was long past; the concert was over, the crowds were
thinning. I followed the ebb. Leaving the radiant park and well-lit
Haute-Ville -LRB-still well lit, this it seems was to be a <div class="bookquote">``nuit blanche''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in Villette-RRB-, I sought the dim lower quarter.

<p/>Dim I should not say, for the beauty of moonlight--forgotten in the
park--here once more flowed in upon perception. High she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) rode, and calm
and stainlessly she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shone. The music and the mirth of the fête, the
fire and bright hues of those lamps had out-done and out-shone her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for
an hour, but now, again, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) glory and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) silence triumphed. The rival
lamps were dying: she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) course like a white fate. Drum, trumpet,
bugle, had uttered their clangour, and were forgotten; with pencil-ray
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wrote on heaven and on earth records for archives everlasting. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
and those stars seemed to me at once the types and witnesses of truth
all regnant. The night-sky lit her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) reign: like its slow-wheeling
progress, advanced her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) victory--that onward movement which has been,
and is, and will be from eternity to eternity.

<p/>These oil-twinkling streets are very still: I like them for their
lowliness and peace. Homeward-bound burghers pass me now and then, but
these companies are pedestrians, make little noise, and are soon gone.
So well do I love Villette under her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) present aspect, not willingly
would I re-enter under a roof, but that I am bent on pursuing my
strange adventure to a successful close, and quietly regaining my bed
in the great dormitory, before Madame Beck comes home.

<p/>Only one street lies between me and the Rue Fossette; as I enter it,
for the first time, the sound of a carriage tears up the deep peace of
this quarter. It comes this way--comes very fast. How loud sounds its
rattle on the paved path! The street is narrow, and I keep carefully to
the causeway. The carriage thunders past, but what do I see, or fancy I
see, as it rushes by? Surely something white fluttered from that
window--surely a hand waved a handkerchief. Was that signal meant for
me? Am I known? Who could recognise me? That is not M. de
Bassompierre's carriage, nor Mrs. Bretton's; and besides, neither the
Hôtel Crécy nor the château of La Terrasse lies in that direction.
Well, I have no time for conjecture; I must hurry home.

<p/>Gaining the Rue Fossette, reaching the pensionnat, all there was still;
no fiacre had yet arrived with Madame and Désirée. I had left the great
door ajar; should I find it thus? Perhaps the wind or some other
accident may have thrown it to with sufficient force to start the
spring-bolt? In that case, hopeless became admission; my adventure must
issue in catastrophe. I lightly pushed the heavy leaf; would it yield?

<p/>Yes. As soundless, as unresisting, as if some propitious genius had
waited on a sesame-charm, in the vestibule within. Entering with bated
breath, quietly making all fast, shoelessly mounting the staircase, I
sought the dormitory, and reached my couch.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>Ay! I reached it, and once more drew a free inspiration. The next
moment, I almost shrieked--almost, but not quite, thank Heaven!

<p/>Throughout the dormitory, throughout the house, there reigned at this
hour the stillness of death. All slept, and in such hush, it seemed
that none dreamed. Stretched on the nineteen beds lay nineteen forms,
at full-length and motionless. On mine--the twentieth couch--nothing
_ought_ to have lain: I had left it void, and void should have found
it. What, then; do I see between the half-drawn curtains? What dark,
usurping shape, supine, long, and strange? Is it a robber who has made
his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) way through the open street-door, and lies there in wait? It looks
very black, I think it looks--not human. Can it be a wandering dog that
has come in from the street and crept and nestled hither? Will it
spring, will it leap out if I approach? Approach I must. Courage! One
step!--

<p/>My head reeled, for by the faint night-lamp, I saw stretched on my bed
the old phantom--the NUN.

<p/>A cry at this moment might have ruined me. Be the spectacle what it
might, I could afford neither consternation, scream, nor swoon.
Besides, I was not overcome. Tempered by late incidents, my nerves
disdained hysteria. Warm from illuminations, and music, and thronging
thousands, thoroughly lashed up by a new scourge, I defied spectra. In
a moment, without exclamation, I had rushed on the haunted couch;
nothing leaped out, or sprung, or stirred; all the movement was mine,
so was all the life, the reality, the substance, the force; as my
instinct felt. I tore her (<font color='blue'><b>thousands</b></font>) up--the incubus! I held her (<font color='blue'><b>thousands</b></font>) on high--the
goblin! I shook her (<font color='blue'><b>thousands</b></font>) loose--the mystery! And down she (<font color='blue'><b>thousands</b></font>) fell--down all
around me--down in shreds and fragments--and I trode upon her (<font color='blue'><b>thousands</b></font>).

<p/>Here again--behold the branchless tree, the unstabled Rosinante; the
film of cloud, the flicker of moonshine. The long nun proved a long
bolster dressed in a long black stole, and artfully invested with a
white veil. The garments in very truth, strange as it may seem, were
genuine nun's garments, and by some hand they had been disposed with a
view to illusion. Whence came these vestments? Who contrived this
artifice? These questions still remained. To the head-bandage was
pinned a slip of paper: it bore in pencil these mocking words--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The nun of the attic bequeaths to Lucy Snowe her (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) wardrobe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Snowe</b></font>) will be
seen in the Rue Fossette no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And what and who was she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) that had haunted me? She (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>), I had actually seen
three times. Not a woman of my acquaintance had the stature of that
ghost. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not of a female height. Not to any man I knew could the
machination, for a moment, be attributed.

<p/>Still mystified beyond expression, but as thoroughly, as suddenly,
relieved from all sense of the spectral and unearthly; scorning also to
wear out my brain with the fret of a trivial though insoluble riddle, I
just bundled together stole, veil, and bandages, thrust them beneath my
pillow, lay down, listened till I heard the wheels of Madame's
home-returning fiacre, then turned, and worn out by many nights'
vigils, conquered, too, perhaps, by the now reacting narcotic, I deeply
slept.




<p/>CHAPTER XL.

<p/>THE HAPPY PAIR.


<p/>The day succeeding this remarkable Midsummer night, proved no common
day. I do not mean that it brought signs in heaven above, or portents
on the earth beneath; nor do I allude to meteorological phenomena, to
storm, flood, or whirlwind. On the contrary: the sun rose jocund, with
a July face. Morning decked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) beauty with rubies, and so filled her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
lap with roses, that they fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in showers, making her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) path
blush: the Hours woke fresh as nymphs, and emptying on the early hills
their dew-vials, they stepped out dismantled of vapour: shadowless,
azure, and glorious, they led the sun's steeds on a burning and
unclouded course.

<p/>In short, it was as fine a day as the finest summer could boast; but I
doubt whether I was not the sole inhabitant of the Rue Fossette, who
cared or remembered to note this pleasant fact. Another thought busied
all other heads; a thought, indeed, which had its share in my
meditations; but this master consideration, not possessing for me so
entire a novelty, so overwhelming a suddenness, especially so dense a
mystery, as it offered to the majority of my co-speculators thereon,
left me somewhat more open than the rest to any collateral observation
or impression.

<p/>Still, while walking in the garden, feeling the sunshine, and marking
the blooming and growing plants, I pondered the same subject the whole
house discussed.

<p/>What subject?

<p/>Merely this. When matins came to be said, there was a place vacant in
the first rank of boarders. When breakfast was served, there remained a
coffee-cup unclaimed. When the housemaid made the beds, she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) found in
one, a bolster laid lengthwise, clad in a cap and night-gown; and when
Ginevra Fanshawe's music-mistress came early, as usual, to give the
morning lesson, that accomplished and promising young person, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
pupil, failed utterly to be forthcoming.

<p/>High and low was Miss Fanshawe sought; through length and breadth was
the house ransacked; vainly; not a trace, not an indication, not so
much as a scrap of a billet rewarded the search; the nymph was
vanished, engulfed in the past night, like a shooting star swallowed up
by darkness.

<p/>Deep was the dismay of surveillante teachers, deeper the horror of the
defaulting directress. Never had I seen Madame Beck so pale or so
appalled. Here was a blow struck at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) tender part, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) weak side;
here was damage done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) interest. How, too, had the untoward event
happened? By what outlet had the fugitive taken wing? Not a casement
was found unfastened, not a pane of glass broken; all the doors were
bolted secure. Never to this day has Madame Beck obtained satisfaction
on this point, nor indeed has anybody else concerned, save and
excepting one, Lucy Snowe, who could not forget how, to facilitate a
certain enterprise, a certain great door had been drawn softly to its
lintel, closed, indeed, but neither bolted nor secure. The thundering
carriage-and-pair encountered were now likewise recalled, as well as
that puzzling signal, the waved handkerchief.

<p/>From these premises, and one or two others, inaccessible to any but
myself, I could draw but one inference. It was a case of elopement.
Morally certain on this head, and seeing Madame Beck's profound
embarrassment, I at last communicated my conviction. Having alluded to
M. de Hamal's suit, I found, as I expected, that Madame Beck was
perfectly au fait to that affair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) had long since discussed it with
Mrs. Cholmondeley, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>) own responsibility in the business on
that lady's shoulders. To Mrs. Cholmondeley and M. de Bassompierre she (<font color='blue'><b>Cholmondeley</b></font>)
now had recourse.

<p/>We found that the Hôtel Crécy was already alive to what had happened.
Ginevra had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginevra</b></font>) cousin Paulina, vaguely signifying hymeneal
intentions; communications had been received from the family of de
Hamal; M. de Bassompierre was on the track of the fugitives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bassompierre</b></font>)
overtook them too late.

<p/>In the course of the week, the post brought me a note. I may as well
transcribe it; it contains explanation on more than one point:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DEAR OLD TIM '' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-short for Timon-RRB-,--<div class="bookquote">'' I am off you see--gone like a
shot. Alfred and I intended to be married in this way almost from the
first; we never meant to be spliced in the humdrum way of other people;
Alfred has too much spirit for that, and so have I--Dieu merci! Do you
know, Alfred, who used to call you `the dragon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timon</b></font>)</div>has seen so much of
you during the last few months, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) begins to feel quite friendly
towards you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) hopes you won't miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) has gone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) begs
to apologize for any little trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) may have given you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) is afraid
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) rather inconvenienced you once when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) came upon you in the grenier,
just as you were reading a letter seemingly of the most special
interest; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) could not resist the temptation to give you a start,
you appeared so wonderfully taken up with your correspondent. En
revanche, he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) says you once frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) by rushing in for a dress or
a shawl, or some other chiffon, at the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) had struck a
light, and was going to take a quiet whiff of his (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) cigar, while waiting
for me.

<p/>``Do you begin to comprehend by this time that M. le Comte de Hamal was
the nun of the attic, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came to see your humble servant? I
will tell you how he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) managed it. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has the entrée of the
Athénée, where two or three of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nephews, the sons of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eldest
sister, Madame de Melcy, are students. You know the court of the
Athénée is on the other side of the high wall bounding your walk, the
allée défendue. Alfred can climb as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) can dance or fence: his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
amusement was to make the escalade of our pensionnat by mounting, first
the wall; then--by the aid of that high tree overspreading the grand
berceau, and resting some of its boughs on the roof of the lower
buildings of our premises--he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) managed to scale the first classe and the
grand salle. One night, by the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) fell out of this tree, tore down
some of the branches, nearly broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) own neck, and after all, in
running away, got a terrible fright, and was nearly caught by two
people, Madame Beck and M. Emanuel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) thinks, walking in the alley.
From the grande salle the ascent is not difficult to the highest block
of building, finishing in the great garret. The skylight, you know, is,
day and night, left half open for air; by the skylight he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) entered.
Nearly a year ago I chanced to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) our legend of the nun; that
suggested his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) romantic idea of the spectral disguise, which I think you
must allow he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) has very cleverly carried out.

<p/>``But for the nun's black gown and white veil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) would have been caught
again and again both by you and that tiger-Jesuit, M. Paul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thinks
you both capital ghost-seers, and very brave. What I wonder at is,
rather your secretiveness than your courage. How could you endure the
visitations of that long spectre, time after time, without crying out,
telling everybody, and rousing the whole house and neighbourhood?

<p/>``Oh, and how did you like the nun as a bed-fellow? _I_ dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) up:
didn't I do it well? Did you shriek when you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>): I should have
gone mad; but then you have such nerves!--real iron and bend-leather! I
believe you feel nothing. You haven't the same sensitiveness that a
person of my constitution has. You seem to me insensible both to pain
and fear and grief. You are a real old Diogenes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear grandmother! and are you not mightily angry at my moonlight
flitting and run away match? I assure you it is excellent fun, and I
did it partly to spite that minx, Paulina, and that bear, Dr. John: to
show them that, with all their airs, I could get married as well as
they. M. de Bassompierre was at first in a strange fume with Alfred; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
threatened a prosecution for 'détournement de mineur,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I know not
what; he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) was so abominably in earnest, that I found myself forced to do
a little bit of the melodramatic--go down on my knees, sob, cry, drench
three pocket-handkerchiefs. Of course, `mon oncle' soon gave in;
indeed, where was the use of making a fuss? I am married, and that's
all about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) still says our marriage is not legal, because I am not
of age, forsooth! As if that made any difference! I am just as much
married as if I were a hundred. However, we are to be married again,
and I am to have a trousseau, and Mrs. Cholmondeley is going to
superintend it; and there are some hopes that M. de Bassompierre will
give me a decent portion, which will be very convenient, as dear Alfred
has nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) nobility, native and hereditary, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) pay. I
only wish uncle would do things unconditionally, in a generous,
gentleman-like fashion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) is so disagreeable as to make the dowry
depend on Alfred's giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) written promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) will never touch
cards or dice from the day it is paid down. They accuse my angel of a
tendency to play: I don't know anything about that, but I _do_ know he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
is a dear, adorable creature.

<p/>``I cannot sufficiently extol the genius with which de Hamal managed our
flight. How clever in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) to select the night of the fête, when Madame
-LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>) habits-RRB-, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamal</b></font>) said, would infallibly be absent at
the concert in the park. I suppose _you_ must have gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paulina</b></font>). I
watched you rise and leave the dormitory about eleven o'clock. How you
returned alone, and on foot, I cannot conjecture. That surely was _you_
we met in the narrow old Rue St. Jean? Did you see me wave my
handkerchief from the carriage window?

<p/>``Adieu! Rejoice in my good luck: congratulate me on my supreme
happiness, and believe me, dear cynic and misanthrope, yours, in the
best of health and spirits,

<p/>GINEVRA LAURA DE HAMAL, née FANSHAWE.

<p/>``P.S.--Remember, I am a countess now. Papa, mamma, and the girls at
home, will be delighted to hear that. ``My daughter the Countess!'' ``My
sister the Countess!<div class="bookquote">'' Bravo! Sounds rather better than Mrs. John
Bretton, hein?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>In winding up Mistress Fanshawe's memoirs, the reader will no doubt
expect to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) came finally to bitter expiation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
youthful levities. Of course, a large share of suffering lies in
reserve for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) future.

<p/>A few words will embody my farther knowledge respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>).

<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) towards the close of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) honeymoon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) called on Madame
Beck, and sent for me into the salon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) rushed into my arms laughing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) looked very blooming and beautiful: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) curls were longer, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
cheeks rosier than ever: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) white bonnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) Flanders veil, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
orange-flowers and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) bride's dress, became her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) mightily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have got my portion!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) cried at once; -LRB-Ginevra ever stuck to the
substantial; I always thought there was a good trading element in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>)
composition, much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanshawe</b></font>) scorned the <div class="bookquote">``bourgeoise;'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``and uncle de
Bassompierre is quite reconciled. I don't mind his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) calling Alfred a
`nincompoop'--that's only his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) coarse Scotch breeding; and I believe
Paulina envies me, and Dr. John is wild with jealousy--fit to blow his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
brains out--and I'm so happy! I really think I've hardly anything left
to wish for--unless it be a carriage and an hotel, and, oh! I--must
introduce you to `mon mari.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alfred, come here!''

<p/>And Alfred appeared from the inner salon, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was talking to
Madame Beck, receiving the blended felicitations and reprimands of that
lady. I was presented under my various names: the Dragon, Diogenes, and
Timon. The young Colonel was very polite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) made me a prettily-turned,
neatly-worded apology, about the ghost-visits, &c., concluding with
saying that <div class="bookquote">``the best excuse for all his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) iniquities stood there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) bride.

<p/>And then the bride sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) back to Madame Beck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) took me to
herself, and proceeded literally to suffocate me with her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) unrestrained
spirits, her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) girlish, giddy, wild nonsense. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) ring
exultingly; she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) called herself Madame la Comtesse de Hamal, and asked
how it sounded, a score of times. I said very little. I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) only
the crust and rind of my nature. No matter she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) expected of me nothing
better--she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) knew me too well to look for compliments--my dry gibes
pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) well enough and the more impassible and prosaic my mien,
the more merrily she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>Soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) marriage, M. de Hamal was persuaded to leave the army as
the surest way of weaning him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) from certain unprofitable associates and
habits; a post of attaché was procured for him (<font color='blue'><b>attaché</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>attaché</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>attaché</b></font>) young
wife went abroad. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would forget me now, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not.
For many years, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kept up a capricious, fitful sort of
correspondence. During the first year or two, it was only of herself
and Alfred she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wrote; then, Alfred faded in the background; herself and
a certain, new comer prevailed; one Alfred Fanshawe de Bassompierre de
Hamal began to reign in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) father's stead. There were great boastings
about this personage, extravagant amplifications upon miracles of
precocity, mixed with vehement objurgations against the phlegmatic
incredulity with which I received them. I didn't know <div class="bookquote">``what it was to
be a mother;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``unfeeling thing that I was, the sensibilities of the
maternal heart were Greek and Hebrew to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and so on. In due course
of nature this young gentleman took his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) degrees in teething, measles,
hooping-cough: that was a terrible time for me--the mamma's letters
became a perfect shout of affliction; never woman was so put upon by
calamity: never human being stood in such need of sympathy. I was
frightened at first, and wrote back pathetically; but I soon found out
there was more cry than wool in the business, and relapsed into my
natural cruel insensibility. As to the youthful sufferer, he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) weathered
each storm like a hero. Five times was that youth <div class="bookquote">``in articulo mortis,''
 (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div>and five times did he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) miraculously revive.

<p/>In the course of years there arose ominous murmurings against Alfred
the First; M. de Bassompierre had to be appealed to, debts had to be
paid, some of them of that dismal and dingy order called <div class="bookquote">``debts of
honour;''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bassompierre/de Bassompierre/M. DE BASSOMPIERRE</b></font>)</div>ignoble plaints and difficulties became frequent. Under every
cloud, no matter what its nature, Ginevra, as of old, called out
lustily for sympathy and aid. She (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) had no notion of meeting any distress
single-handed. In some shape, from some quarter or other, she (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) was
pretty sure to obtain her (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) will, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) got on--fighting the battle
of life by proxy, and, on the whole, suffering as little as any human
being I have ever known.




<p/>CHAPTER XLI.

<p/>FAUBOURG CLOTILDE.


<p/>Must I, ere I close, render some account of that Freedom and Renovation
which I won on the fête-night? Must I tell how I and the two stalwart
companions I brought home from the illuminated park bore the test of
intimate acquaintance?

<p/>I tried them the very next day. They had boasted their strength loudly
when they reclaimed me from love and its bondage, but upon my demanding
deeds, not words, some evidence of better comfort, some experience of a
relieved life--Freedom excused himself, as for the present impoverished
and disabled to assist; and Renovation never spoke; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had died in the
night suddenly.

<p/>I had nothing left for it then but to trust secretly that conjecture
might have hurried me too fast and too far, to sustain the oppressive
hour by reminders of the distorting and discolouring magic of jealousy.
After a short and vain struggle, I found myself brought back captive to
the old rack of suspense, tied down and strained anew.

<p/>Shall I yet see him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) goes? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) bear me in mind? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
purpose to come? Will this day--will the next hour bring him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)? or must I
again assay that corroding pain of long attent--that rude agony of
rupture at the close, that mute, mortal wrench, which, in at once
uprooting hope and doubt, shakes life; while the hand that does the
violence cannot be caressed to pity, because absence interposes her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
barrier!

<p/>It was the Feast of the Assumption; no school was held. The boarders
and teachers, after attending mass in the morning, were gone a long
walk into the country to take their goûter, or afternoon meal, at some
farm-house. I did not go with them, for now but two days remained ere
the _Paul et Virginie_ must sail, and I was clinging to my last chance,
as the living waif of a wreck clings to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) last raft or cable.

<p/>There was some joiners' work to do in the first classe, some bench or
desk to repair; holidays were often turned to account for the
performance of these operations, which could not be executed when the
rooms were filled with pupils. As I sat solitary, purposing to adjourn
to the garden and leave the coast clear, but too listless to fulfil my
own intent, I heard the workmen coming.

<p/>Foreign artisans and servants do everything by couples: I believe it
would take two Labassecourien carpenters to drive a nail. While tying
on my bonnet, which had hitherto hung by its ribbons from my idle hand,
I vaguely and momentarily wondered to hear the step of but one
<div class="bookquote">``ouvrier.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I noted, too--as captives in dungeons find sometimes dreary
leisure to note the merest trifles--that this man wore shoes, and not
sabots: I concluded that it must be the master-carpenter, coming to
inspect before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) journeymen. I threw round me my scarf. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
advanced; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened the door; my back was towards it; I felt a little
thrill--a curious sensation, too quick and transient to be analyzed. I
turned, I stood in the supposed master-artisan's presence: looking
towards the door-way, I saw it filled with a figure, and my eyes
printed upon my brain the picture of M. Paul.

<p/>Hundreds of the prayers with which we weary Heaven bring to the
suppliant no fulfilment. Once haply in life, one golden gift falls
prone in the lap--one boon full and bright, perfect from Fruition's
mint.

<p/>M. Emanuel wore the dress in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) probably purposed to travel--a
surtout, guarded with velvet; I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) prepared for instant
departure, and yet I had understood that two days were yet to run
before the ship sailed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) looked well and cheerful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) looked kind and
benign: he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) came in with eagerness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) was close to me in one second; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
was all amity. It might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) bridegroom mood which thus brightened
him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>). Whatever the cause, I could not meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) sunshine with cloud. If
this were my last moment with him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), I would not waste it in forced,
unnatural distance. I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) well--too well not to smite out of my
path even Jealousy herself, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would have obstructed a kind
farewell. A cordial word from his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lips, or a gentle look from his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) eyes,
would do me good, for all the span of life that remained to me; it
would be comfort in the last strait of loneliness; I would take it--I
would taste the elixir, and pride should not spill the cup.

<p/>The interview would be short, of course: he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would say to me just what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) had said to each of the assembled pupils; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would take and hold my
hand two minutes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would touch my cheek with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lips for the first,
last, only time--and then--no more. Then, indeed, the final parting,
then the wide separation, the great gulf I could not pass to go to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)--across which, haply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) would not glance, to remember me.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) took my hand in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), with the other he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) put back my bonnet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
looked into my face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) luminous smile went out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) lips expressed
something almost like the wordless language of a mother who finds a
child greatly and unexpectedly changed, broken with illness, or worn
out by want. A check supervened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul, Paul!''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said a woman's hurried voice behind, <div class="bookquote">``Paul, come into the
salon; I have yet a great many things to say to you--conversation for
the whole day--and so has Victor; and Josef is here. Come Paul, come to
your friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Beck, brought to the spot by vigilance or an inscrutable
instinct, pressed so near, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) almost thrust herself between me and M.
Emanuel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Paul!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reiterated, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye grazing me with its hard ray like
a steel stylet. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pushed against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kinsman. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) receded; I
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) would go. Pierced deeper than I could endure, made now to
feel what defied suppression, I cried--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My heart will break!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>What I felt seemed literal heart-break; but the seal of another
fountain yielded under the strain: one breath from M. Paul, the
whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Trust me!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>lifted a load, opened an outlet. With many a deep
sob, with thrilling, with icy shiver, with strong trembling, and yet
with relief--I wept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) to me; it is a crisis: I will give her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) a cordial, and it
will pass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Beck/Beck</b></font>)</div>said the calm Madame Beck.

<p/>To be left to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cordial seemed to me something like being
left to the poisoner and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bowl. When M. Paul answered deeply,
harshly, and briefly--<div class="bookquote">``Laissez-moi!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>in the grim sound I felt a music
strange, strong, but life-giving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laissez-moi!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) repeated, his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) nostrils opening, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) facial
muscles all quivering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But this will never do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame, with sternness. More sternly
rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kinsman--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sortez d'ici!''

 (<font color='red'><b>kinsman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will send for Père Silas: on the spot I will send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
threatened pertinaciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Femme!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>cried the Professor, not now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) deep tones, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
highest and most excited key, <div class="bookquote">``Femme! sortez à l'instant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was roused, and I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) wrath with a passion beyond what
I had yet felt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What you do is wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>pursued Madame; <div class="bookquote">``it is an act characteristic of
men of your unreliable, imaginative temperament; a step impulsive,
injudicious, inconsistent--a proceeding vexatious, and not estimable in
the view of persons of steadier and more resolute character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know not what I have of steady and resolute in me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but
you shall see; the event shall teach you. Modeste,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) continued less
fiercely, <div class="bookquote">``be gentle, be pitying, be a woman; look at this poor face,
and relent. You know I am your friend, and the friend of your friends;
in spite of your taunts, you well and deeply know I may be trusted. Of
sacrificing myself I made no difficulty but my heart is pained by what
I see; it _must_ have and give solace. _Leave me!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This time, in the <div class="bookquote">''_leave me_''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>there was an intonation so bitter and so
imperative, I wondered that even Madame Beck herself could for one
moment delay obedience; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood firm; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gazed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>)
dauntless; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Beck</b></font>) eye, forbidding and fixed as stone. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
opening her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips to retort; I saw over all M. Paul's face a quick
rising light and fire; I can hardly tell how he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) managed the movement;
it did not seem violent; it kept the form of courtesy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
hand; it scarce touched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) I thought; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whirled from the
room; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gone, and the door shut, in one second.

<p/>The flash of passion was all over very soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told me to
wipe my eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waited quietly till I was calm, dropping from time to
time a stilling, solacing word. Ere long I sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) once more
myself--re-assured, not desperate, nor yet desolate; not friendless,
not hopeless, not sick of life, and seeking death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It made you very sad then to lose your friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It kills me to be forgotten, Monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``All these weary days
I have not heard from you one word, and I was crushed with the
possibility, growing to certainty, that you would depart without saying
farewell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I tell you what I told Modeste Beck--that you do not know me?
Must I show and teach you my character? You _will_ have proof that I
can be a firm friend? Without clear proof this hand will not lie still
in mine, it will not trust my shoulder as a safe stay? Good. The proof
is ready. I come to justify myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say anything, teach anything, prove anything, Monsieur; I can listen
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, in the first place, you must go out with me a good distance into
the town. I came on purpose to fetch you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Without questioning his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) meaning, or sounding his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) plan, or offering the
semblance of an objection, I re-tied my bonnet: I was ready.

<p/>The route he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took was by the boulevards: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) several times made me sit
down on the seats stationed under the lime-trees; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not ask if I
was tired, but looked, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own conclusions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All these weary days,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), repeating my words, with a gentle,
kindly mimicry of my voice and foreign accent, not new from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips,
and of which the playful banter never wounded, not even when coupled,
as it often was, with the assertion, that however I might _write_ his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
language, I _spoke_ and always should speak it imperfectly and
hesitatingly. <div class="bookquote">''`All these weary days' I have not for one hour forgotten
you. Faithful women err in this, that they think themselves the sole
faithful of God's creatures. On a very fervent and living truth to
myself, I, too, till lately scarce dared count, from any quarter;
but--look at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I lifted my happy eyes: they _were_ happy now, or they would have been
no interpreters of my heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), after some seconds' scrutiny, <div class="bookquote">``there is no denying
that signature: Constancy wrote it: her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) pen is of iron. Was the record
painful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Severely painful,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, with truth. <div class="bookquote">``Withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) hand, Monsieur; I
can bear its inscribing force no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Elle est toute pâle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), speaking to himself; <div class="bookquote">``cette figure-là
me fait mal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I am not pleasant to look at--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help saying this; the words came unbidden: I never remember
the time when I had not a haunting dread of what might be the degree of
my outward deficiency; this dread pressed me at the moment with special
force.

<p/>A great softness passed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) countenance; his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) violet eyes grew
suffused and glistening under their deep Spanish lashes: he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) started up;
<div class="bookquote">``Let us walk on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I displease your eyes _much_?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I took courage to urge: the point
had its vital import for me.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stopped, and gave me a short, strong answer; an answer which
silenced, subdued, yet profoundly satisfied. Ever after that I knew
what I was for _him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)_; and what I might be for the rest of the world, I
ceased painfully to care. Was it weak to lay so much stress on an
opinion about appearance? I fear it might be; I fear it was; but in
that case I must avow no light share of weakness. I must own great fear
of displeasing--a strong wish moderately to please M. Paul.

<p/>Whither we rambled, I scarce knew. Our walk was long, yet seemed short;
the path was pleasant, the day lovely. M. Emanuel talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
voyage--he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) thought of staying away three years. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) return from
Guadaloupe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) looked forward to release from liabilities and a clear
course; and what did I purpose doing in the interval of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) absence? he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
asked. I had talked once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) reminded me, of trying to be independent
and keeping a little school of my own: had I dropped the idea?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I had not: I was doing my best to save what would enable me to
put it in practice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) did not like leaving me in the Rue Fossette; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>) feared I should
miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Fossette</b></font>) there too much--I should feel desolate--I should grow sad--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was certain; but I promised to do my best to endure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), speaking low, <div class="bookquote">``there is another objection to your
present residence. I should wish to write to you sometimes: it would
not be well to have any uncertainty about the safe transmission of
letters; and in the Rue Fossette--in short, our Catholic discipline in
certain matters--though justifiable and expedient--might possibly,
under peculiar circumstances, become liable to misapplication--perhaps
abuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you write,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I _must_ have your letters; and I _will_
have them: ten directors, twenty directresses, shall not keep them from
me. I am a Protestant: I will not bear that kind of discipline:
Monsieur, I _will not_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doucement--doucement,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rejoined he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``we will contrive a plan; we have
our resources: soyez tranquille.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) paused.

<p/>We were now returning from the long walk. We had reached the middle of
a clean Faubourg, where the houses were small, but looked pleasant. It
was before the white door-step of a very neat abode that M. Paul had
halted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I call here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not knock, but taking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) pocket a key, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) opened and
entered at once. Ushering me in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) shut the door behind us. No servant
appeared. The vestibule was small, like the house, but freshly and
tastefully painted; its vista closed in a French window with vines
trained about the panes, tendrils, and green leaves kissing the glass.
Silence reigned in this dwelling.

<p/>Opening an inner door, M. Paul disclosed a parlour, or salon--very
tiny, but I thought, very pretty. Its delicate walls were tinged like a
blush; its floor was waxed; a square of brilliant carpet covered its
centre; its small round table shone like the mirror over its hearth;
there was a little couch, a little chiffonnière, the half-open,
crimson-silk door of which, showed porcelain on the shelves; there was
a French clock, a lamp; there were ornaments in biscuit china; the
recess of the single ample window was filled with a green stand,
bearing three green flower-pots, each filled with a fine plant glowing
in bloom; in one corner appeared a guéridon with a marble top, and upon
it a work-box, and a glass filled with violets in water. The lattice of
this room was open; the outer air breathing through, gave freshness,
the sweet violets lent fragrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty, pretty place!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. M. Paul smiled to see me so pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must we sit down here and wait?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in a whisper, half awed by
the deep pervading hush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will first peep into one or two other nooks of this nutshell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dare you take the freedom of going all over the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I dare,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), quietly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) led the way. I was shown a little kitchen with a little stove and
oven, with few but bright brasses, two chairs and a table. A small
cupboard held a diminutive but commodious set of earthenware.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a coffee service of china in the salon,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>said M. Paul, as I
looked at the six green and white dinner-plates; the four dishes, the
cups and jugs to match.

<p/>Conducted up the narrow but clean staircase, I was permitted a glimpse
of two pretty cabinets of sleeping-rooms; finally, I was once more led
below, and we halted with a certain ceremony before a larger door than
had yet been opened.

<p/>Producing a second key, M. Emanuel adjusted it to the lock of this
door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) opened, put me in before him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Voici!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) cried.

<p/>I found myself in a good-sized apartment, scrupulously clean, though
bare, compared with those I had hitherto seen. The well-scoured boards
were carpetless; it contained two rows of green benches and desks, with
an alley down the centre, terminating in an estrade, a teacher's chair
and table; behind them a tableau. On the walls hung two maps; in the
windows flowered a few hardy plants; in short, here was a miniature
classe--complete, neat, pleasant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a school then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Who keeps it? I never heard of an
establishment in this faubourg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you have the goodness to accept of a few prospectuses for
distribution in behalf of a friend of mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>), taking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>)
surtout-pocket some quires of these documents, and putting them into my
hand. I looked, I read--printed in fair characters:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Externat de demoiselles. Numéro 7, Faubourg Clotilde, Directrice,
Mademoiselle Lucy Snowe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>And what did I say to M. Paul Emanuel?

<p/>Certain junctures of our lives must always be difficult of recall to
memory. Certain points, crises, certain feelings, joys, griefs, and
amazements, when reviewed, must strike us as things wildered and
whirling, dim as a wheel fast spun.

<p/>I can no more remember the thoughts or the words of the ten minutes
succeeding this disclosure, than I can retrace the experience of my
earliest year of life: and yet the first thing distinct to me is the
consciousness that I was speaking very fast, repeating over and over
again:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you do this, M. Paul? Is this your house? Did you furnish it? Did
you get these papers printed? Do you mean me? Am I the directress? Is
there another Lucy Snowe? Tell me: say something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) would not speak. His (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) pleased silence, his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) laughing down-look,
his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) attitude, are visible to me now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it? I must know all--_all_,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried.

<p/>The packet of papers fell on the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) had extended his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) hand, and I
had fastened thereon, oblivious of all else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you said I had forgotten you all these weary days,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Poor
old Emanuel! These are the thanks he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) gets for trudging about three
mortal weeks from house-painter to upholsterer, from cabinet-maker to
charwoman. Lucy and Lucy's cot, the sole thoughts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hardly knew what to do. I first caressed the soft velvet on his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) cuff,
and then. I stroked the hand it surrounded. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) foresight, his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)
goodness, his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) silent, strong, effective goodness, that overpowered me
by their proved reality. It was the assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) sleepless interest
which broke on me like a light from heaven; it was his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)--I will dare to
say it--his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) fond, tender look, which now shook me indescribably. In the
midst of all I forced myself to look at the practical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The trouble!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, <div class="bookquote">``and the cost! Had you money, M. Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plenty of money!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) heartily. <div class="bookquote">``The disposal of my large teaching
connection put me in possession of a handsome sum with part of it I
determined to give myself the richest treat that I _have_ known or
_shall_ know. I like this. I have reckoned on this hour day and night
lately. I would not come near you, because I would not forestall it.
Reserve is neither my virtue nor my vice. If I had put myself into your
power, and you had begun with your questions of look and lip--Where
have you been, M. Paul? What have you been doing? What is your
mystery?--my solitary first and last secret would presently have
unravelled itself in your lap. Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``you shall live here
and have a school; you shall employ yourself while I am away; you shall
think of me sometimes; you shall mind your health and happiness for my
sake, and when I come back--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) left a blank.

<p/>I promised to do all he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) told me. I promised to work hard and willingly.
<div class="bookquote">``I will be your faithful steward,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; <div class="bookquote">``I trust at your coming the
account will be ready. Monsieur, monsieur, you are _too_ good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In such inadequate language my feelings struggled for expression: they
could not get it; speech, brittle and unmalleable, and cold as ice,
dissolved or shivered in the effort. He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) watched me, still; he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) gently
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) hand to stroke my hair; it touched my lips in passing; I
pressed it close, I paid it tribute. He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) was my king; royal for me had
been that hand's bounty; to offer homage was both a joy and a duty.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>The afternoon hours were over, and the stiller time of evening shaded
the quiet faubourg. M. Paul claimed my hospitality; occupied and afoot
since morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) needed refreshment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said I should offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
chocolate in my pretty gold and white china service. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went out and
ordered what was needful from the restaurant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) placed the small
guéridon and two chairs in the balcony outside the French window under
the screening vines. With what shy joy I accepted my part as hostess,
arranged the salver, served the benefactor-guest.

<p/>This balcony was in the rear of the house, the gardens of the faubourg
were round us, fields extended beyond. The air was still, mild, and
fresh. Above the poplars, the laurels, the cypresses, and the roses,
looked up a moon so lovely and so halcyon, the heart trembled under her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
smile; a star shone subject beside her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), with the unemulous ray of pure
love. In a large garden near us, a jet rose from a well, and a pale
statue leaned over the play of waters.

<p/>M. Paul talked to me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) voice was so modulated that it mixed
harmonious with the silver whisper, the gush, the musical sigh, in
which light breeze, fountain and foliage intoned their lulling vesper:

<p/>Happy hour--stay one moment! droop those plumes, rest those wings;
incline to mine that brow of Heaven! White Angel! let thy light linger;
leave its reflection on succeeding clouds; bequeath its cheer to that
time which needs a ray in retrospect!

<p/>Our meal was simple: the chocolate, the rolls, the plate of fresh
summer fruit, cherries and strawberries bedded in green leaves formed
the whole: but it was what we both liked better than a feast, and I
took a delight inexpressible in tending M. Paul. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whether
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) friends, Père Silas and Madame Beck, knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had done--whether
they had seen my house?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mon amie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``none knows what I have done save you and myself:
the pleasure is consecrated to us two, unshared and unprofaned. To
speak truth, there has been to me in this matter a refinement of
enjoyment I would not make vulgar by communication. Besides''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-smiling-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``I wanted to prove to Miss Lucy that I _could_ keep a secret. How often
has she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) taunted me with lack of dignified reserve and needful caution!
How many times has she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saucily insinuated that all my affairs are the
secret of Polichinelle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was true enough: I had not spared him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) on this point, nor perhaps
on any other that was assailable. Magnificent-minded, grand-hearted,
dear, faulty little man! You deserved candour, and from me always had
it.

<p/>Continuing my queries, I asked to whom the house belonged, who was my
landlord, the amount of my rent. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instantly gave me these particulars
in writing; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had foreseen and prepared all things.

<p/>The house was not M. Paul's--that I guessed: he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was hardly the man to
become a proprietor; I more than suspected in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a lamentable absence
of the saving faculty; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could get, but not keep; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) needed a
treasurer. The tenement, then, belonged to a citizen in the
Basse-Ville--a man of substance, M. Paul said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) startled me by
adding: <div class="bookquote">``a friend of yours, Miss Lucy, a person who has a most
respectful regard for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And, to my pleasant surprise, I found the
landlord was none other than M. Miret, the short-tempered and
kind-hearted bookseller, who had so kindly found me a seat that
eventful night in the park. It seems M. Miret was, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) station,
rich, as well as much respected, and possessed several houses in this
faubourg; the rent was moderate, scarce half of what it would have been
for a house of equal size nearer the centre of Villette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>observed M. Paul, <div class="bookquote">``should fortune not favour you, though I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) will, I have the satisfaction to think you are in good hands;
M. Miret will not be extortionate: the first year's rent you have
already in your savings; afterwards Miss Lucy must trust God, and
herself. But now, what will you do for pupils?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must distribute my prospectuses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right! By way of losing no time, I gave one to M. Miret yesterday.
Should you object to beginning with three petite bourgeoises, the
Demoiselles Miret? They are at your service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, you forget nothing; you are wonderful. Object? It would
become me indeed to object! I suppose I hardly expect at the outset to
number aristocrats in my little day-school; I care not if they never
come. I shall be proud to receive M. Miret's daughters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides these,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>pursued he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``another pupil offers, who will come daily
to take lessons in English; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is rich, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) will pay
handsomely. I mean my god-daughter and ward, Justine Marie Sauveur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>What is in a name?--what in three words? Till this moment I had
listened with living joy--I had answered with gleeful quickness; a name
froze me; three words struck me mute. The effect could not be hidden,
and indeed I scarce tried to hide it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What now?''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Paul/M. Emanuel/Paul</b></font>)</div>said M. Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing! Your countenance changes: your colour and your very eyes
fade. Nothing! You must be ill; you have some suffering; tell me what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had nothing to tell.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chair nearer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not grow vexed, though I continued
silent and icy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) tried to win a word; he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) entreated with perseverance,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waited with patience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Justine Marie is a good girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``docile and amiable; not
quick--but you will like her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) must not come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Such was my speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to puzzle me? Do you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)? But, in truth, there _is_
something. Again you are pale as that statue. Rely on Paul Carlos; tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) the grief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chair touched mine; his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand, quietly advanced, turned me towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know Marie Justine?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) again.

<p/>The name re-pronounced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lips overcame me unaccountably. It did
not prostrate--no, it stirred me up, running with haste and heat
through my veins--recalling an hour of quick pain, many days and nights
of heart-sickness. Near me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) now sat, strongly and closely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had long twined his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life in mine--far as had progressed, and near as
was achieved our minds' and affections' assimilation--the very
suggestion of interference, of heart-separation, could be heard only
with a fermenting excitement, an impetuous throe, a disdainful resolve,
an ire, a resistance of which no human eye or cheek could hide the
flame, nor any truth-accustomed human tongue curb the cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you something,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said: <div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak, Lucy; come near; speak. Who prizes you, if I do not? Who is
your friend, if not Emanuel? Speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I spoke. All escaped from my lips. I lacked not words now; fast I
narrated; fluent I told my tale; it streamed on my tongue. I went back
to the night in the park; I mentioned the medicated draught--why it was
given--its goading effect--how it had torn rest from under my head,
shaken me from my couch, carried me abroad with the lure of a vivid yet
solemn fancy--a summer-night solitude on turf, under trees, near a
deep, cool lakelet. I told the scene realized; the crowd, the masques,
the music, the lamps, the splendours, the guns booming afar, the bells
sounding on high. All I had encountered I detailed, all I had
recognised, heard, and seen; how I had beheld and watched himself: how
I listened, how much heard, what conjectured; the whole history, in
brief, summoned to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) confidence, rushed thither, truthful, literal,
ardent, bitter.

<p/>Still as I narrated, instead of checking, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) incited me to proceed he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
spurred me by the gesture, the smile, the half-word. Before I had half
done, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held both my hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) consulted my eyes with a most piercing
glance: there was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face which tended neither to calm
nor to put me down; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own doctrine, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) forsook his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own
system of repression when I most challenged its exercise. I think I
deserved strong reproof; but when have we our deserts? I merited
severity; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked indulgence. To my very self I seemed imperious and
unreasonable, for I forbade Justine Marie my door and roof; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smiled,
betraying delight. Warm, jealous, and haughty, I knew not till now that
my nature had such a mood: he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gathered me near his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heart. I was full of
faults; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took them and me all home. For the moment of utmost mutiny,
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reserved the one deep spell of peace. These words caressed my ear:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, take my love. One day share my life. Be my dearest, first on
earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Great</b></font>)</div><p/>We walked back to the Rue Fossette by moonlight--such moonlight as fell
on Eden--shining through the shades of the Great Garden, and haply
gilding a path glorious for a step divine--a Presence nameless. Once in
their lives some men and women go back to these first fresh days of our
great Sire and Mother--taste that grand morning's dew--bathe in its
sunrise.

<p/>In the course of the walk I was told how Justine Marie Sauveur had
always been regarded with the affection proper to a daughter--how, with
M. Paul's consent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sauveur</b></font>) had been affianced for months to one Heinrich
Mühler, a wealthy young German merchant, and was to be married in the
course of a year. Some of M. Emanuel's relations and connections would,
indeed, it seems, have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Sauveur</b></font>), with a view to securing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sauveur</b></font>) fortune in the family; but to himself the scheme was repugnant, and
the idea totally inadmissible.

<p/>We reached Madame Beck's door. Jean Baptiste's clock tolled nine. At
this hour, in this house, eighteen months since, had this man at my
side bent before me, looked into my face and eyes, and arbitered my
destiny. This very evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had again stooped, gazed, and decreed.
How different the look--how far otherwise the fate!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deemed me born under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) star: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to have spread over me its
beam like a banner. Once--unknown, and unloved, I held him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) harsh and
strange; the low stature, the wiry make, the angles, the darkness, the
manner, displeased me. Now, penetrated with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) influence, and living
by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection, having his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worth by intellect, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goodness by
heart--I preferred him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before all humanity.

<p/>We parted: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pledge, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farewell. We parted: the
next day--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sailed.




<p/>CHAPTER XLII.

<p/>FINIS.


<p/>Man cannot prophesy. Love is no oracle. Fear sometimes imagines a vain
thing. Those years of absence! How had I sickened over their
anticipation! The woe they must bring seemed certain as death. I knew
the nature of their course: I never had doubt how it would harrow as it
went. The juggernaut on his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) car towered there a grim load. Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
draw nigh, burying his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) broad wheels in the oppressed soil--I, the
prostrate votary--felt beforehand the annihilating craunch.

<p/>Strange to say--strange, yet true, and owning many parallels in life's
experience--that anticipatory craunch proved all--yes--nearly _all_ the
torture. The great Juggernaut, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) great chariot, drew on lofty,
loud, and sullen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) passed quietly, like a shadow sweeping the sky, at
noon. Nothing but a chilling dimness was seen or felt. I looked up.
Chariot and demon charioteer were gone by; the votary still lived.

<p/>M. Emanuel was away three years. Reader, they were the three happiest
years of my life. Do you scout the paradox? Listen. I commenced my
school; I worked--I worked hard. I deemed myself the steward of his (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)
property, and determined, God willing, to render a good account. Pupils
came--burghers at first--a higher class ere long. About the middle of
the second year an unexpected chance threw into my hands an additional
hundred pounds: one day I received from England a letter containing
that sum. It came from Mr. Marchmont, the cousin and heir of my dear
and dead mistress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was just recovering from a dangerous illness; the
money was a peace-offering to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) conscience, reproaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in the
matter of, I know not what, papers or memoranda found after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
kinswoman's death--naming or recommending Lucy Snowe. Mrs. Barrett had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) my address. How far his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) conscience had been sinned against, I
never inquired. I asked no questions, but took the cash and made it
useful.

<p/>With this hundred pounds I ventured to take the house adjoining mine. I
would not leave that which M. Paul had chosen, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had left,
and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) expected again to find me. My externat became a
pensionnat; that also prospered.

<p/>The secret of my success did not lie so much in myself, in any
endowment, any power of mine, as in a new state of circumstances, a
wonderfully changed life, a relieved heart. The spring which moved my
energies lay far away beyond seas, in an Indian isle. At parting, I had
been left a legacy; such a thought for the present, such a hope for the
future, such a motive for a persevering, a laborious, an enterprising,
a patient and a brave course--I _could_ not flag. Few things shook me
now; few things had importance to vex, intimidate, or depress me: most
things pleased--mere trifles had a charm.

<p/>Do not think that this genial flame sustained itself, or lived wholly
on a bequeathed hope or a parting promise. A generous provider supplied
bounteous fuel. I was spared all chill, all stint; I was not suffered
to fear penury; I was not tried with suspense. By every vessel he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
wrote; he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) wrote as he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) gave and as he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) loved, in full-handed,
full-hearted plenitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) wrote because he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) liked to write; he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) did not
abridge, because he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) cared not to abridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) sat down, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) took pen and
paper, because he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) loved Lucy and had much to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); because he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was
faithful and thoughtful, because he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was tender and true. There was no
sham and no cheat, and no hollow unreal in him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). Apology never dropped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) slippery oil on his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) lips--never proffered, by his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) pen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) coward
feints and paltry nullities: he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) would give neither a stone, nor an
excuse--neither a scorpion; nor a disappointment; his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) letters were real
food that nourished, living water that refreshed.

<p/>And was I grateful? God knows! I believe that scarce a living being so
remembered, so sustained, dealt with in kind so constant, honourable
and noble, could be otherwise than grateful to the death.

<p/>Adherent to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own religion -LRB-in him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was not the stuff of which is made
the facile apostate-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>apostate</b></font>) freely left me my pure faith. He (<font color='blue'><b>apostate</b></font>) did not tease
nor tempt. He (<font color='blue'><b>apostate</b></font>) said:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remain a Protestant. My little English Puritan, I love Protestantism
in you. I own its severe charm. There is something in its ritual I
cannot receive myself, but it is the sole creed for `Lucy.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>All Rome could not put into him (<font color='blue'><b>apostate</b></font>) bigotry, nor the Propaganda itself make
him (<font color='blue'><b>apostate</b></font>) a real Jesuit. He (<font color='blue'><b>apostate</b></font>) was born honest, and not false--artless, and not
cunning--a freeman, and not a slave. His (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) tenderness had rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)
ductile in a priest's hands, his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) affection, his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) devotedness, his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)
sincere pious enthusiasm blinded his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) kind eyes sometimes, made him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)
abandon justice to himself to do the work of craft, and serve the ends
of selfishness; but these are faults so rare to find, so costly to
their owner to indulge, we scarce know whether they will not one day be
reckoned amongst the jewels.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>And now the three years are past: M. Emanuel's return is fixed. It is
Autumn; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) is to be with me ere the mists of November come. My school
flourishes, my house is ready: I have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) a little library, filled
its shelves with the books he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) left in my care: I have cultivated out of
love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) -LRB-I was naturally no florist-RRB- the plants he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) preferred, and
some of them are yet in bloom. I thought I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) went away;
I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) now in another degree: he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) is more my own.

<p/>The sun passes the equinox; the days shorten, the leaves grow sere;
but--he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) is coming.

<p/>Frosts appear at night; November has sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) fogs in advance; the wind
takes its autumn moan; but--he (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) is coming.

<p/>The skies hang full and dark--a wrack sails from the west; the clouds
cast themselves into strange forms--arches and broad radiations; there
rise resplendent mornings--glorious, royal, purple as monarch in his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>)
state; the heavens are one flame; so wild are they, they rival battle
at its thickest--so bloody, they shame Victory in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emanuel</b></font>) pride. I know
some signs of the sky; I have noted them ever since childhood. God
watch that sail! Oh! guard it!

<p/>The wind shifts to the west. Peace, peace, Banshee--<div class="bookquote">``keening''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>at every
window! It will rise--it will swell--it shrieks out long: wander as I
may through the house this night, I cannot lull the blast. The
advancing hours make it strong: by midnight, all sleepless watchers
hear and fear a wild south-west storm. That storm roared frenzied, for
seven days. It did not cease till the Atlantic was strewn with wrecks:
it did not lull till the deeps had gorged their full of sustenance. Not
till the destroying angel of tempest had achieved his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) perfect work,
would he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) fold the wings whose waft was thunder--the tremor of whose
plumes was storm.

<p/>Peace, be still! Oh! a thousand weepers, praying in agony on waiting
shores, listened for that voice, but it was not uttered--not uttered
till; when the hush came, some could not feel it: till, when the sun
returned, his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) light was night to some!

<p/>Here pause: pause at once. There is enough said. Trouble no quiet, kind
heart; leave sunny imaginations hope. Let it be theirs to conceive the
delight of joy born again fresh out of great terror, the rapture of
rescue from peril, the wondrous reprieve from dread, the fruition of
return. Let them picture union and a happy succeeding life.

<p/>Madame Beck prospered all the days of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) life; so did Père Silas;
Madame Walravens fulfilled her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ninetieth year before she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) died. Farewell.

<p/>THE END.
