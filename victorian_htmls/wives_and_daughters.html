<p/>Editorial note:

<p/>_Wives and Daughters_ was first published serially in the
_Cornhill Magazine_ from August, 1864, to January, 1866.
Elizabeth Gaskell died suddenly in November, 1865. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daughters</b></font>) had
completed all but the last chapter, and in that sense the
book, which many consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Daughters</b></font>) masterpiece, is unfinished.
The editor of the _Cornhill Magazine_, Frederick Greenwood,
appended his (<font color='blue'><b>Greenwood</b></font>) comments about Mrs. Gaskell's intentions for
the conclusion and about Mrs. Gaskell as a person. Those
comments are included at the end of this e-book. _Wives
and Daughters_ was first published in book form in 1866 by
Smith, Elder.

<p/>Both the _Cornhill_ serial and the Smith, Elder first
edition had eighteen full-page illustrations by George
du Maurier, and those are included in this e-book. The
_Cornhill_ edition also had small illustrations at the
beginning of seventeen chapters, and those too are
included. The illustrations can be seen by viewing the

<p/>CHAPTER I.

<p/>THE DAWN OF A GALA DAY.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>To begin with the old rigmarole of childhood. In a country there was
a shire, and in that shire there was a town, and in that town there
was a house, and in that house there was a room, and in that room
there was a bed, and in that bed there lay a little girl; wide awake
and longing to get up, but not daring to do so for fear of the unseen
power in the next room--a certain Betty, whose slumbers must not
be disturbed until six o'clock struck, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) wakened of herself
<div class="bookquote">``as sure as clockwork,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and left the household very little peace
afterwards. It was a June morning, and early as it was, the room was
full of sunny warmth and light.

<p/>On the drawers opposite to the little white dimity bed in which Molly
Gibson lay, was a primitive kind of bonnet-stand on which was hung a
bonnet, carefully covered over from any chance of dust with a large
cotton handkerchief, of so heavy and serviceable a texture that if
the thing underneath it had been a flimsy fabric of gauze and lace
and flowers, it would have been altogether <div class="bookquote">``scomfished''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>-LRB-again to
quote from Betty's vocabulary-RRB-. But the bonnet was made of solid
straw, and its only trimming was a plain white ribbon put over the
crown, and forming the strings. Still, there was a neat little
quilling inside, every plait of which Molly knew, for had she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) not
made it herself the evening before, with infinite pains? and was
there not a little blue bow in this quilling, the very first bit of
such finery Molly had ever had the prospect of wearing?

<p/>Six o'clock now! the pleasant, brisk ringing of the church bells told
that; calling every one to their daily work, as they had done for
hundreds of years. Up jumped Molly, and ran with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bare little feet
across the room, and lifted off the handkerchief and saw once again
the bonnet; the pledge of the gay bright day to come. Then to the
window, and after some tugging she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) opened the casement, and let in
the sweet morning air. The dew was already off the flowers in the
garden below, but still rising from the long hay-grass in the meadows
directly beyond. At one side lay the little town of Hollingford,
into a street of which Mr. Gibson's front door opened; and delicate
columns, and little puffs of smoke were already beginning to rise
from many a cottage chimney where some housewife was already up, and
preparing breakfast for the bread-winner of the family.

<p/>Molly Gibson saw all this, but all she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought about it was, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! it
will be a fine day! I was afraid it never, never would come; or that,
if it ever came, it would be a rainy day!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Five-and-forty years ago,
children's pleasures in a country town were very simple, and Molly
had lived for twelve long years without the occurrence of any event
so great as that which was now impending. Poor child! it is true
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother, which was a jar to the whole tenour of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life; but that was hardly an event in the sense referred to; and
besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been too young to be conscious of it at the time.
The pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was looking forward to to-day was her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) first share in
a kind of annual festival in Hollingford.

<p/>The little straggling town faded away into country on one side close
to the entrance-lodge of a great park, where lived my Lord and Lady
Cumnor: <div class="bookquote">``the earl''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``the countess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>as they were always called by
the inhabitants of the town; where a very pretty amount of feudal
feeling still lingered, and showed itself in a number of simple ways,
droll enough to look back upon, but serious matters of importance
at the time. It was before the passing of the Reform Bill, but a
good deal of liberal talk took place occasionally between two or
three of the more enlightened freeholders living in Hollingford;
and there was a great Tory family in the county who, from time to
time, came forward and contested the election with the rival Whig
family of Cumnor. One would have thought that the above-mentioned
liberal-talking inhabitants would have, at least, admitted the
possibility of their voting for the Hely-Harrison, and thus trying to
vindicate their independence. But no such thing. <div class="bookquote">``The earl''  (<font color='red'><b>earl lord owner</b></font>)</div>was lord
of the manor, and owner of much of the land on which Hollingford was
built; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) household were fed, and doctored, and, to a certain
measure, clothed by the good people of the town; their fathers'
grandfathers had always voted for the eldest son of Cumnor Towers,
and following in the ancestral track, every man-jack in the place
gave his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) vote to the liege lord, totally irrespective of such
chimeras as political opinion.

<p/>This was no unusual instance of the influence of the great
land-owners over humbler neighbours in those days before railways,
and it was well for a place where the powerful family, who thus
overshadowed it, were of so respectable a character as the Cumnors.
They expected to be submitted to, and obeyed; the simple worship of
the townspeople was accepted by the earl and countess as a right; and
they would have stood still in amazement, and with a horrid memory
of the French sansculottes who were the bugbears of their youth, had
any inhabitant of Hollingford ventured to set his (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) will or opinions
in opposition to those of the earl. But, yielded all that obeisance,
they did a good deal for the town, and were generally condescending,
and often thoughtful and kind in their treatment of their vassals.
Lord Cumnor was a forbearing landlord; putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) steward a little
on one side sometimes, and taking the reins into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own hands now
and then, much to the annoyance of the agent, who was, in fact, too
rich and independent to care greatly for preserving a post where his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
decisions might any day be overturned by my lord's taking a fancy
to go <div class="bookquote">``pottering''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as the agent irreverently expressed it in the
sanctuary of his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) own home-RRB-, which, being interpreted, meant that
occasionally the earl asked his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) own questions of his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) own tenants,
and used his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) own eyes and ears in the management of the smaller
details of his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) property. But his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) tenants liked my lord all the better
for this habit of his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>). Lord Cumnor had certainly a little time for
gossip, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) contrived to combine with the failing of personal
intervention between the old land-steward and the tenantry. But,
then, the countess made up by her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) unapproachable dignity for this
weakness of the earl's. Once a year she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was condescending. She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) and
the ladies, her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) daughters, had set up a school; not a school after
the manner of schools now-a-days, where far better intellectual
teaching is given to the boys and girls of labourers and work-people
than often falls to the lot of their betters in worldly estate; but
a school of the kind we should call <div class="bookquote">``industrial,''  (<font color='red'><b>betters</b></font>)</div>where girls are
taught to sew beautifully, to be capital housemaids, and pretty fair
cooks, and, above all, to dress neatly in a kind of charity uniform
devised by the ladies of Cumnor Towers;--white caps, white tippets,
check aprons, blue gowns, and ready curtseys, and <div class="bookquote">``please, ma'ams,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>being _de rigueur_.

<p/>Now, as the countess was absent from the Towers for a considerable
part of the year, she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was glad to enlist the sympathy of the
Hollingford ladies in this school, with a view to obtaining their aid
as visitors during the many months that she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) daughters were
away. And the various unoccupied gentlewomen of the town responded to
the call of their liege lady, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) their service as required;
and along with it, a great deal of whispered and fussy admiration.
<div class="bookquote">``How good of the countess! So like the dear countess--always thinking
of others!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and so on; while it was always supposed that no strangers
had seen Hollingford properly, unless they had been taken to the
countess's school, and been duly impressed by the neat little pupils,
and the still neater needlework there to be inspected. In return,
there was a day of honour set apart every summer, when with much
gracious and stately hospitality, Lady Cumnor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) daughters
received all the school visitors at the Towers, the great family
mansion standing in aristocratic seclusion in the centre of the large
park, of which one of the lodges was close to the little town. The
order of this annual festivity was this. About ten o'clock one of the
Towers' carriages rolled through the lodge, and drove to different
houses, wherein dwelt a woman to be honoured; picking them up by ones
or twos, till the loaded carriage drove back again through the ready
portals, bowled along the smooth tree-shaded road, and deposited its
covey of smartly-dressed ladies on the great flight of steps leading
to the ponderous doors of Cumnor Towers. Back again to the town;
another picking up of womankind in their best clothes, and another
return, and so on till the whole party were assembled either in the
house or in the really beautiful gardens. After the proper amount of
exhibition on the one part, and admiration on the other, had been
done, there was a collation for the visitors, and some more display
and admiration of the treasures inside the house. Towards four
o'clock, coffee was brought round; and this was a signal of the
approaching carriage that was to take them back to their own homes;
whither they returned with the happy consciousness of a well-spent
day, but with some fatigue at the long-continued exertion of behaving
their best, and talking on stilts for so many hours. Nor were
Lady Cumnor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) daughters free from something of the same
self-approbation, and something, too, of the same fatigue; the
fatigue that always follows on conscious efforts to behave as will
best please the society you are in.

<p/>For the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) life, Molly Gibson was to be included among
the guests at the Towers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was much too young to be a visitor at
the school, so it was not on that account that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was to go; but it
had so happened that one day when Lord Cumnor was on a <div class="bookquote">``pottering''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Cumnor</b></font>)</div>expedition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had met Mr. Gibson, _the_ doctor of the neighbourhood,
coming out of the farm-house my lord was entering; and having some
small question to ask the surgeon -LRB-Lord Cumnor seldom passed any
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) acquaintance without asking a question of some sort--not
always attending to the answer; it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) mode of conversation-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
accompanied Mr. Gibson to the out-building, to a ring in the wall of
which the surgeon's horse was fastened. Molly was there too, sitting
square and quiet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) rough little pony, waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) grave eyes opened large and wide at the close neighbourhood and
evident advance of <div class="bookquote">``the earl;''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>for to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) little imagination the
grey-haired, red-faced, somewhat clumsy man, was a cross between an
arch-angel and a king.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your daughter, eh, Gibson?--nice little girl, how old? Pony wants
grooming though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>patting it as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) talked. <div class="bookquote">``What's your name,
my dear? He (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>)'s sadly behindhand with his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) rent, as I was saying,
but if he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>)'s really ill, I must see after Sheepshanks, who is a
hardish man of business. What's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) complaint? You'll come to our
school-scrimmage on Thursday, little girl--what's-your-name? Mind you
send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or bring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Gibson; and just give a word to your groom,
for I'm sure that pony wasn't singed last year, now, was he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>)? Don't
forget Thursday, little girl--what's-your-name?--it's a promise
between us, is it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>the earl</b></font>)</div>And off the earl trotted, attracted by the
sight of the farmer's eldest son on the other side of the yard.

<p/>Mr. Gibson mounted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) and Molly rode off. They did not speak
for some time. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``May I go, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in rather an anxious
little tone of voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), wakening up out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own professional
thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Towers--on Thursday, you know. That gentleman''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was shy
of calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) title-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``asked me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like it, my dear? It has always seemed to me rather a
tiresome piece of gaiety--rather a tiring day, I mean--beginning so
early--and the heat, and all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd like to go then, would you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; if I may!--He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) asked me, you know. Don't you think I may?--he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
asked me twice over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! we'll see--yes! I think we can manage it, if you wish it so
much, Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they were silent again. By-and-by, Molly said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, papa--I do wish to go,--but I don't care about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's rather a puzzling speech. But I suppose you mean you don't
care to go, if it will be any trouble to get you there. I can easily
manage it, however, so you may consider it settled. You'll want a
white frock, remember; you'd better tell Betty you're going, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)'ll see after making you tidy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, there were two or three things to be done by Mr. Gibson, before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could feel quite comfortable about Molly's going to the festival
at the Towers, and each of them involved a little trouble on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
part. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was very willing to gratify his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) little girl; so the
next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode over to the Towers, ostensibly to visit some sick
housemaid, but, in reality, to throw himself in my lady's way, and
get her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to ratify Lord Cumnor's invitation to Molly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) chose his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
time, with a little natural diplomacy; which, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had often
to exercise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) intercourse with the great family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) rode into
the stable-yard about twelve o'clock, a little before luncheon-time,
and yet after the worry of opening the post-bag and discussing its
contents was over. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) went in by the
back-way to the house; the <div class="bookquote">``House''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on this side, the <div class="bookquote">``Towers''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at the
front. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) patient, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) directions to the housekeeper,
and then went out, with a rare wild-flower in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) hand, to find one
of the ladies Tranmere in the garden, where, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) hope
and calculation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) came upon Lady Cumnor too,--now talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
daughter about the contents of an open letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
hand, now directing a gardener about certain bedding-out plants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was calling to see Nanny, and I took the opportunity of bringing
Lady Agnes the plant I was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) about as growing on Cumnor
Moss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, so much, Mr. Gibson. Mamma, look! this is the _Drosera
rotundifolia_ I have been wanting so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! yes; very pretty I daresay, only I am no botanist. Nanny is
better, I hope? We can't have any one laid up next week, for the
house will be quite full of people,--and here are the Danbys waiting
to offer themselves as well. One comes down for a fortnight of quiet,
at Whitsuntide, and leaves half one's establishment in town, and as
soon as people know of our being here, we get letters without end,
longing for a breath of country air, or saying how lovely the Towers
must look in spring; and I must own, Lord Cumnor is a great deal to
blame for it all, for as soon as ever we are down here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) rides
about to all the neighbours, and invites them to come over and spend
a few days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall go back to town on Friday the 18th,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agnes/Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Lady Agnes, in a
consolatory tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes! as soon as we have got over the school visitors' affair.
But it is a week to that happy day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, availing himself of the good opening
thus presented, <div class="bookquote">``I met my lord at the Cross-trees Farm yesterday, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was kind enough to ask my little daughter, who was with me, to be
one of the party here on Thursday; it would give the lassie great
pleasure, I believe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) paused for Lady Cumnor to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well! if my lord asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lassie</b></font>), I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>lassie</b></font>) must come, but I wish
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was not so amazingly hospitable! Not but what the little girl will
be quite welcome; only, you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) met a younger Miss Browning the
other day, of whose existence I had never heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) visits at the school, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agnes/Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Lady Agnes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) does; I never said she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) did not. I knew there was
one visitor of the name of Browning; I never knew there were two,
but, of course, as soon as Lord Cumnor heard there was another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
must needs ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>); so the carriage will have to go backwards and
forwards four times now to fetch them all. So your daughter can come
quite easily, Mr. Gibson, and I shall be very glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) for
your sake. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) can sit bodkin with the Brownings, I suppose? You'll
arrange it all with them; and mind you get Nanny well up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>) work
next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as Mr. Gibson was going away, Lady Cumnor called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Oh!
by-the-by, Clare is here; you remember Clare, don't you? She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was a
patient of yours, long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) repeated, in a bewildered tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you recollect her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)? Miss Clare, our old governess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agnes/Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Agnes. <div class="bookquote">``About twelve or fourteen years ago, before Lady Cuxhaven was
married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Miss Clare, who had the scarlet fever here; a
very pretty delicate girl. But I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was married!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was a silly little thing, and did
not know when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was well off; we were all very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), I'm
sure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went and married a poor curate, and became a stupid Mrs.
Kirkpatrick; but we always kept on calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) ``Clare.<div class="bookquote">'' And now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s dead, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) a widow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) is staying here; and we
are racking our brains to find out some way of helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) to a
livelihood without parting her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)'s somewhere about
the grounds, if you like to renew your acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my lady. I'm afraid I cannot stop to-day. I have a long
round to go; I've stayed here too long as it is, I'm afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Long</b></font>)</div><p/>Long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) ride had been that day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) called on the Miss Brownings
in the evening, to arrange about Molly's accompanying them to the
Towers. They were tall handsome women, past their first youth, and
inclined to be extremely complaisant to the widowed doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh dear! Mr. Gibson, but we shall be delighted to have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with us.
You should never have thought of asking us such a thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning the elder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I'm hardly sleeping at nights for thinking of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Phoebe. <div class="bookquote">``You know I've never been there before. Sister has
many a time; but somehow, though my name has been down on the
visitors' list these three years, the countess has never named me in
her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) note; and you know I could not push myself into notice, and go to
such a grand place without being asked; how could I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told Phoebe last year,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``that I was sure it was
only inadvertence, as one may call it, on the part of the countess,
and that her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) ladyship would be as hurt as any one when she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) didn't
see Phoebe among the school visitors; but Phoebe has got a delicate
mind, you see, Mr. Gibson, and all I could say she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) wouldn't go, but
stopped here at home; and it spoilt all my pleasure all that day,
I do assure you, to think of Phoebe's face, as I saw it over the
window-blinds, as I rode away; her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) eyes were full of tears, if you'll
believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a good cry after you was gone, Dorothy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe;
<div class="bookquote">``but for all that, I think I was right in stopping away from where
I was not asked. Don't you, Mr. Gibson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And you see you are going this year; and last
year it rained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes! I remember! I set myself to tidy my drawers, to string myself
up, as it were; and I was so taken up with what I was about that
I was quite startled when I heard the rain beating against the
window-panes. ``Goodness me!<div class="bookquote">'' said I to myself, `whatever will become
of sister's white satin shoes, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) has to walk about on soppy
grass after such rain as this?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>for, you see, I thought a deal about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) having a pair of smart shoes; and this year she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) has gone and got
me a white satin pair just as smart as hers, for a surprise.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly will know she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) best clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning. <div class="bookquote">``We could perhaps lend her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a few beads, or artificials, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wants them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly must go in a clean white frock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, rather
hastily; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not admire the Miss Brownings' taste in dress,
and was unwilling to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) child decked up according to their
fancy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) esteemed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) old servant Betty's as the more correct,
because the more simple. Miss Browning had just a shade of annoyance
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) tone as she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) drew herself up, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! very well. It's
quite right, I'm sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But Miss Phoebe said, <div class="bookquote">``Molly will look very
nice in whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) puts on, that's certain.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER II.

<p/>A NOVICE AMONGST THE GREAT FOLK.


<p/>At ten o'clock on the eventful Thursday the Towers' carriage began
its work. Molly was ready long before it made its first appearance,
although it had been settled that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and the Miss Brownings were not
to go until the last, or fourth, time of its coming. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face had
been soaped, scrubbed, and shone brilliantly clean; her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) frills, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
frock, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ribbons were all snow-white. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had on a black mode cloak
that had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's; it was trimmed round with rich lace, and
looked quaint and old-fashioned on the child. For the first time in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wore kid gloves; hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had only had cotton ones.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gloves were far too large for the little dimpled fingers, but as
Betty had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) they were to last her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) for years, it was all very
well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) trembled many a time, and almost turned faint once with the
long expectation of the morning. Betty might say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) liked about
a watched pot never boiling; Molly never ceased to watch the approach
through the winding street, and after two hours the carriage came
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had to sit very forward to avoid crushing the
Miss Brownings' new dresses; and yet not too forward, for fear of
incommoding fat Mrs. Goodenough and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) niece, who occupied the
front seat of the carriage; so that altogether the fact of sitting
down at all was rather doubtful, and to add to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) discomfort, Molly
felt herself to be very conspicuously placed in the centre of the
carriage, a mark for all the observation of Hollingford. It was far
too much of a gala day for the work of the little town to go forward
with its usual regularity. Maid-servants gazed out of upper windows;
shopkeepers' wives stood on the door-steps; cottagers ran out, with
babies in their arms; and little children, too young to know how
to behave respectfully at the sight of an earl's carriage, huzzaed
merrily as it bowled along. The woman at the lodge held the gate
open, and dropped a low curtsey to the liveries. And now they were
in the Park; and now they were in sight of the Towers, and silence
fell upon the carriage-full of ladies, only broken by one faint
remark from Mrs. Goodenough's niece, a stranger to the town, as they
drew up before the double semicircle flight of steps which led to the
door of the mansion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They call that a perron, I believe, don't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) asked. But
the only answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) obtained was a simultaneous <div class="bookquote">``hush.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was very
awful, as Molly thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) half wished herself at home again.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lost all consciousness of herself by-and-by when the party
strolled out into the beautiful grounds, the like of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had never even imagined. Green velvet lawns, bathed in sunshine,
stretched away on every side into the finely wooded park; if there
were divisions and ha-has between the soft sunny sweeps of grass, and
the dark gloom of the forest-trees beyond, Molly did not see them;
and the melting away of exquisite cultivation into the wilderness
had an inexplicable charm to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Near the house there were walls
and fences; but they were covered with climbing roses, and rare
honeysuckles and other creepers just bursting into bloom. There were
flower-beds, too, scarlet, crimson, blue, orange; masses of blossom
lying on the greensward. Molly held Miss Browning's hand very tight
as they loitered about in company with several other ladies, and
marshalled by a daughter of the Towers, who seemed half amused at the
voluble admiration showered down upon every possible thing and place.
Molly said nothing, as became her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) age and position, but every now and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) full heart by drawing a deep breath, almost
like a sigh. Presently they came to the long glittering range of
greenhouses and hothouses, and an attendant gardener was there to
admit the party. Molly did not care for this half so much as for
the flowers in the open air; but Lady Agnes had a more scientific
taste, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) expatiated on the rarity of this plant, and the mode of
cultivation required by that, till Molly began to feel very tired,
and then very faint. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was too shy to speak for some time; but at
length, afraid of making a greater sensation if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began to cry, or
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fell against the stands of precious flowers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) caught at
Miss Browning's hand, and gasped out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go back, out into the garden? I can't breathe here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, to be sure, love. I daresay it's hard understanding for
you, love; but it's very fine and instructive, and a deal of Latin in
it too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) turned hastily round not to lose another word of Lady Agnes'
lecture on orchids, and Molly turned back and passed out of the
heated atmosphere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt better in the fresh air; and unobserved,
and at liberty, went from one lovely spot to another, now in the open
park, now in some shut-in flower-garden, where the song of the birds,
and the drip of the central fountain, were the only sounds, and the
tree-tops made an enclosing circle in the blue June sky; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went
along without more thought as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) whereabouts than a butterfly
has, as it skims from flower to flower, till at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) grew
very weary, and wished to return to the house, but did not know
how, and felt afraid of encountering all the strangers who would be
there, unprotected by either of the Miss Brownings. The hot sun told
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) head, and it began to ache. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) saw a great wide-spreading
cedar-tree upon a burst of lawn towards which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) was advancing, and
the black repose beneath its branches lured her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) thither. There was
a rustic seat in the shadow, and weary Molly sate down there, and
presently fell asleep.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was startled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) slumbers after a time, and jumped to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
feet. Two ladies were standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). They were
perfect strangers to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and with a vague conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
done something wrong, and also because she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was worn-out with hunger,
fatigue, and the morning's excitement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began to cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little woman! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has lost herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belongs to some of the
people from Hollingford, I have no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>said the oldest-looking of
the two ladies; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) who appeared to be about forty, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did
not really number more than thirty years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was plain-featured, and
had rather a severe expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face; her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dress was as rich as
any morning dress could be; her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) voice deep and unmodulated,--what in
a lower rank of life would have been called gruff; but that was not a
word to apply to Lady Cuxhaven, the eldest daughter of the earl and
countess. The other lady looked much younger, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in fact
some years the elder; at first sight Molly thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was the most
beautiful person she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had ever seen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was certainly a very
lovely woman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) voice, too, was soft and plaintive, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) replied
to Lady Cuxhaven,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little darling! she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is overcome by the heat, I have no
doubt--such a heavy straw bonnet, too. Let me untie it for you, my
dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly now found voice to say--<div class="bookquote">``I am Molly Gibson, please. I came here
with Miss Brownings;''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) great fear was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should be taken
for an unauthorized intruder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Brownings?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cuxhaven to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) companion, as if
inquiringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they were the two tall large young women that Lady Agnes was
talking about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I daresay. I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had a number of people in tow;''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>then
looking again at Molly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Have you had anything to eat,
child, since you came? You look a very white little thing; or is it
the heat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had nothing to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, rather piteously; for,
indeed, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fell asleep she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been very hungry.

<p/>The two ladies spoke to each other in a low voice; then the elder
said in a voice of authority, which, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had always used in
speaking to the other, <div class="bookquote">``Sit still here, my dear; we are going to the
house, and Clare shall bring you something to eat before you try to
walk back; it must be a quarter of a mile at least.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So they went
away, and Molly sat upright, waiting for the promised messenger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
did not know who Clare might be, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not care much for food
now; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not walk without some help. At
length she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) saw the pretty lady coming back, followed by a footman
with a small tray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look how kind Lady Cuxhaven is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) who was called Clare. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
chose you out this little lunch herself; and now you must try and eat
it, and you'll be quite right when you've had some food, darling--You
need not stop, Edwards; I will bring the tray back with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was some bread, and some cold chicken, and some jelly, and
a glass of wine, and a bottle of sparkling water, and a bunch of
grapes. Molly put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) trembling little hand for the water; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was too faint to hold it. Clare put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mouth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) took
a long draught and was refreshed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not eat; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) tried,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) headache was too bad. Clare looked bewildered.
<div class="bookquote">``Take some grapes, they will be the best for you; you must try and
eat something, or I don't know how I shall get you to the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My head aches so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heavy eyes wistfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, how tiresome!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Miss Clare</b></font>)</div>said Clare, still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sweet gentle
voice, not at all as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was angry, only expressing an obvious
truth. Molly felt very guilty and very unhappy. Clare went on, with a
shade of asperity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) tone: <div class="bookquote">``You see, I don't know what to do with
you here if you don't eat enough to enable you to walk home. And I've
been out for these three hours trapesing about the grounds till I'm
as tired as can be, and missed my lunch and all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Miss Clare</b></font>)</div>Then, as if a new
idea had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``You lie back in that seat for a few
minutes, and try to eat the bunch of grapes, and I'll wait for you,
and just be eating a mouthful meanwhile. You are sure you don't want
this chicken?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was bid, and leant back, picking languidly at the
grapes, and watching the good appetite with which the lady ate up the
chicken and jelly, and drank the glass of wine. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so pretty and
so graceful in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deep mourning, that even her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hurry in eating, as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was afraid of some one coming to surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the act, did
not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little observer from admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, darling, are you ready to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had eaten
up everything on the tray. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, come; you have nearly finished your
grapes; that's a good girl. Now, if you will come with me to the
side entrance, I will take you up to my own room, and you shall lie
down on the bed for an hour or two; and if you have a good nap your
headache will be quite gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Miss Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>So they set off, Clare carrying the empty tray, rather to Molly's
shame; but the child had enough work to drag herself along, and was
afraid of offering to do anything more. The <div class="bookquote">``side entrance''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>was
a flight of steps leading up from a private flower-garden into a
private matted hall, or ante-room, out of which many doors opened,
and in which were deposited the light garden-tools and the bows and
arrows of the young ladies of the house. Lady Cuxhaven must have seen
their approach, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) met them in this hall as soon as they came
in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) asked; then glancing at the plates and glasses,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Come, I think there can't be much amiss! You're a good
old Clare, but you should have let one of the men fetch that tray in;
life in such weather as this is trouble enough of itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly could not help wishing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty companion would have
told Lady Cuxhaven that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) herself had helped to finish up the
ample luncheon; but no such idea seemed to come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>)
only said,--<div class="bookquote">``Poor dear! she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is not quite the thing yet; has got a
headache, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) says. I am going to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) down on my bed, to see if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) can get a little sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly saw Lady Cuxhaven say something in a half-laughing manner
to <div class="bookquote">``Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and the child could not keep from
tormenting herself by fancying that the words spoken sounded
wonderfully like <div class="bookquote">``Over-eaten herself, I suspect.''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt
too poorly to worry herself long; the little white bed in the cool
and pretty room had too many attractions for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) aching head. The
muslin curtains flapped softly from time to time in the scented air
that came through the open windows. Clare covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) up with a light
shawl, and darkened the room. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was going away Molly roused
herself to say, <div class="bookquote">``Please, ma'am, don't let them go away without me.
Please ask somebody to waken me if I go to sleep. I am to go back
with Miss Brownings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't trouble yourself about it, dear; I'll take care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Miss Clare</b></font>)</div>said Clare,
turning round at the door, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hand to little anxious
Molly. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went away, and thought no more about it.
The carriages came round at half-past four, hurried a little by
Lady Cumnor, who had suddenly become tired of the business of
entertaining, and annoyed at the repetition of indiscriminating
admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not have both carriages out, mamma, and get rid of them all at
once?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cuxhaven. <div class="bookquote">``This going by instalments is the most
tiresome thing that could be imagined.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So at last there had been a
great hurry and an unmethodical way of packing off every one at once.
Miss Browning had gone in the chariot -LRB-or <div class="bookquote">``chawyot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>as Lady Cumnor
called it;--it rhymed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) daughter, Lady Hawyot--or Harriet,
as the name was spelt in the _Peerage_-RRB-, and Miss Phoebe had been
speeded along with several other guests, away in a great roomy family
conveyance, of the kind which we should now call an <div class="bookquote">``omnibus.''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>Each
thought that Molly Gibson was with the other, and the truth was, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lay fast asleep on Mrs. Kirkpatrick's bed--Mrs. Kirkpatrick _née_
Clare.

<p/>The housemaids came in to arrange the room. Their talking aroused
Molly, who sat up on the bed, and tried to push back the hair from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hot forehead, and to remember where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dropped down on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) feet by the side of the bed, to the astonishment of the women,
and said,--<div class="bookquote">``Please, how soon are we going away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us and save us! who'd ha' thought of any one being in the bed?
Are you one of the Hollingford ladies, my dear? They are all gone
this hour or more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, what shall I do? That lady they call Clare promised to
waken me in time. Papa will so wonder where I am, and I don't know
what Betty will say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child began to cry, and the housemaids looked at each other
in some dismay and much sympathy. Just then, they heard Mrs.
Kirkpatrick's step along the passages, approaching. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was singing
some little Italian air in a low musical voice, coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) bedroom
to dress for dinner. One housemaid said to the other, with a knowing
look, <div class="bookquote">``Best leave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>);''  (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div>and they passed on to their work in the
other rooms.

<p/>Mrs. Kirkpatrick opened the door, and stood aghast at the sight of
Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I quite forgot you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said at length. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, don't cry;
you'll make yourself not fit to be seen. Of course I must take the
consequences of your over-sleeping yourself, and if I can't manage to
get you back to Hollingford to-night, you shall sleep with me, and
we'll do our best to send you home to-morrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>sobbed out Molly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) always wants me to make tea for
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); and I have no night-things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't go and make a piece of work about what can't be helped
now. I'll lend you night-things, and your papa must do without your
making tea for him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to-night. And another time don't over-sleep
yourself in a strange house; you may not always find yourself among
such hospitable people as they are here. Why now, if you don't cry
and make a figure of yourself, I'll ask if you may come in to dessert
with Master Smythe and the little ladies. You shall go into the
nursery, and have some tea with them; and then you must come back
here and brush your hair and make yourself tidy. I think it is a very
fine thing for you to be stopping in such a grand house as this; many
a little girl would like nothing better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>During this speech she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) toilette for dinner--taking
off her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) black morning gown; putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dressing-gown; shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
long soft auburn hair over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shoulders, and glancing about the room
in search of various articles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dress,--a running flow of easy
talk came babbling out all the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a little girl of my own, dear! I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would
not give to be staying here at Lord Cumnor's with me; but, instead
of that, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has to spend her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) holidays at school; and yet you are
looking as miserable as can be at the thought of stopping for
just one night. I really have been as busy as can be with those
tiresome--those good ladies, I mean, from Hollingford--and one can't
think of everything at a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly--only child as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was--had stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tears at the mention
of that little girl of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) ventured to
say,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you married, ma'am; I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) called you Clare?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In high good-humour Mrs. Kirkpatrick made reply:--<div class="bookquote">``I don't look as
if I was married, do I? Every one is surprised. And yet I have been
a widow for seven months now: and not a grey hair on my head, though
Lady Cuxhaven, who is younger than I, has ever so many.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do they call you `Clare?'''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>continued Molly, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) so
affable and communicative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I lived with them when I was Miss Clare. It is a pretty
name, isn't it? I married a Mr. Kirkpatrick; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was only a curate,
poor fellow; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was of a very good family, and if three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
relations had died without children I should have been a baronet's
wife. But Providence did not see fit to permit it; and we must always
resign ourselves to what is decreed. Two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) cousins married, and
had large families; and poor dear Kirkpatrick died, leaving me a
widow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a little girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: darling Cynthia! I wish you could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is my only
comfort now. If I have time I will show you her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) picture when we come
up to bed; but I must go now. It does not do to keep Lady Cumnor
waiting a moment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) asked me to be down early, to help with
some of the people in the house. Now I shall ring this bell, and when
the housemaid comes, ask her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) to take you into the nursery, and to
tell Lady Cuxhaven's nurse who you are. And then you'll have tea with
the little ladies, and come in with them to dessert. There! I'm sorry
you've over-slept yourself, and are left here; but give me a kiss,
and don't cry--you really are rather a pretty child, though you've
not got Cynthia's colouring! Oh, Nanny, would you be so very kind as
to take this young lady---LRB-what's your name, my dear? Gibson?-RRB-,--Miss
Gibson, to Mrs. Dyson, in the nursery, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) to
drink tea with the young ladies there; and to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) in with them
to dessert. I'll explain it all to my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Nanny's face brightened out of its gloom when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>) heard the name
Gibson; and, having ascertained from Molly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``the
doctor's''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) showed more willingness to comply with Mrs.
Kirkpatrick's request than was usual with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>).

<p/>Molly was an obliging girl, and fond of children; so, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was in the nursery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) got on pretty well, being obedient to the
wishes of the supreme power, and even very useful to Mrs. Dyson, by
playing at tricks, and thus keeping a little one quiet while its
brothers and sisters were being arrayed in gay attire,--lace and
muslin, and velvet, and brilliant broad ribbons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dyson</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dyson, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) own especial charge were all
ready, <div class="bookquote">``what can I do for you? You have not got another frock here,
have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dyson</b></font>)</div>No, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) had not; nor if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) had had one, could it
have been of a smarter nature than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) present thick white dimity.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) could only wash her (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) face and hands, and submit to the nurse's
brushing and perfuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>) would rather have
stayed in the park all night long, and slept under the beautiful
quiet cedar, than have to undergo the unknown ordeal of <div class="bookquote">``going
down to dessert,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which was evidently regarded both by children and
nurses as the event of the day. At length there was a summons from
a footman, and Mrs. Dyson, in a rustling silk gown, marshalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Dyson</b></font>)
convoy, and set sail for the dining-room door.

<p/>There was a large party of gentlemen and ladies sitting round the
decked table, in the brilliantly lighted room. Each dainty little
child ran up to its mother, or aunt, or particular friend; but Molly
had no one to go to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that tall girl in the thick white frock? Not one of the
children of the house, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady addressed put up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glass, gazed at Molly, and dropped it
in an instant. <div class="bookquote">``A French girl, I should imagine. I know Lady Cuxhaven
was inquiring for one to bring up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) little girls, that they
might get a good accent early. Poor little woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks wild
and strange!''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>And the speaker, who sate next to Lord Cumnor, made a
little sign to Molly to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); Molly crept up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as to the
first shelter; but when the lady began talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in French, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
blushed violently, and said in a very low voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand French. I'm only Molly Gibson, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly Gibson!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, out loud; as if that was not much of
an explanation.

<p/>Lord Cumnor caught the words and the tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Are you the little girl who has been sleeping in
my bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) imitated the deep voice of the fabulous bear, who asks this
question of the little child in the story; but Molly had never read
the <div class="bookquote">``Three Bears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>and fancied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) anger was real; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) trembled
a little, and drew nearer to the kind lady who had beckoned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as
to a refuge. Lord Cumnor was very fond of getting hold of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
fancied was a joke, and working his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) idea threadbare; so all the time
the ladies were in the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) kept on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) running fire at Molly,
alluding to the Sleeping Beauty, the Seven Sleepers, and any other
famous sleeper that came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had no idea of the misery
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) jokes were to the sensitive girl, who already thought herself
a miserable sinner, for having slept on, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ought to have
been awake. If Molly had been in the habit of putting two and two
together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might have found an excuse for herself, by remembering
that Mrs. Kirkpatrick had promised faithfully to awaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) in time;
but all the girl thought of was, how little they wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in this
grand house; how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must seem like a careless intruder who had no
business there. Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wondered where her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father was, and
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was missing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); but the thought of the familiar happiness
of home brought such a choking in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throat, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must
not give way to it, for fear of bursting out crying; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
instinct enough to feel that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was left at the Towers, the less
trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept herself out of observation, the
better.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) followed the ladies out of the dining-room, almost hoping that
no one would see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But that was impossible, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) immediately
became the subject of conversation between the awful Lady Cumnor and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) kind neighbour at dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I thought this young lady was French when I first saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has got the black hair and eyelashes, and grey eyes, and
colourless complexion which one meets with in some parts of France,
and I know Lady Cuxhaven was trying to find a well-educated girl who
would be a pleasant companion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, looking very stern, as Molly thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>)
is the daughter of our medical man at Hollingford; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) came with
the school visitors this morning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) was overcome by the heat
and fell asleep in Clare's room, and somehow managed to over-sleep
herself, and did not waken up till all the carriages were gone. We
will send her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) home to-morrow morning, but for to-night she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) must stay
here, and Clare is kind enough to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) may sleep with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an implied blame running through this speech, that Molly
felt like needle-points all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Lady Cuxhaven came up at this
moment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) tone was as deep, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) manner of speaking as abrupt and
authoritative, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) mother's, but Molly felt the kinder nature
underneath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you now, my dear? You look better than you did under the
cedar-tree. So you're to stop here to-night? Clare, don't you think
we could find some of those books of engravings that would interest
Miss Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Kirkpatrick came gliding up to the place where Molly stood; and
began petting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with pretty words and actions, while Lady Cuxhaven
turned over heavy volumes in search of one that might interest the
girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor darling! I saw you come into the dining-room, looking so shy;
and I wanted you to come near me, but I could not make a sign to you,
because Lord Cuxhaven was speaking to me at the time, telling me
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) travels. Ah, here is a nice book--_Lodge's Portraits_; now
I'll sit by you and tell you who they all are, and all about them.
Don't trouble yourself any more, dear Lady Cuxhaven; I'll take charge
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>); pray leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly grew hotter and hotter as these last words met her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ear. If
they would only leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) alone, and not labour at being kind to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); would <div class="bookquote">``not trouble themselves''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)! These words of Mrs.
Kirkpatrick's seemed to quench the gratitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was feeling to Lady
Cuxhaven for looking for something to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>). But, of course, it
was a trouble, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) ought never to have been there.

<p/>By-and-by, Mrs. Kirkpatrick was called away to accompany Lady Agnes'
song; and then Molly really had a few minutes' enjoyment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could
look round the room, unobserved, and, sure, never was any place out
of a king's house so grand and magnificent. Large mirrors, velvet
curtains, pictures in their gilded frames, a multitude of dazzling
lights decorated the vast saloon, and the floor was studded with
groups of ladies and gentlemen, all dressed in gorgeous attire.
Suddenly Molly bethought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) of the children whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had accompanied
into the dining-room, and to whose ranks she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had appeared to
belong,--where were they? Gone to bed an hour before, at some quiet
signal from their mother. Molly wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might go, too--if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could ever find her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) way back to the haven of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's
bedroom. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was at some distance from the door; a long way from
Mrs. Kirkpatrick, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) felt herself to belong more than to any
one else. Far, too, from Lady Cuxhaven, and the terrible Lady Cumnor,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) jocose and good-natured lord. So Molly sate on, turning over
pictures which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not see; her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart growing heavier and heavier
in the desolation of all this grandeur. Presently a footman entered
the room, and after a moment's looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) went up to Mrs.
Kirkpatrick, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) sate at the piano, the centre of the musical
portion of the company, ready to accompany any singer, and smiling
pleasantly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) willingly acceded to all requests. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) came now
towards Molly, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) corner, and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, darling, your papa has come for you, and brought your
pony for you to ride home; so I shall lose my little bedfellow, for
I suppose you must go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Go! was there a question of it in Molly's mind, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stood up
quivering, sparkling, almost crying out loud. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
senses, though, by Mrs. Kirkpatrick's next words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must go and wish Lady Cumnor good-night, you know, my dear, and
thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) kindness to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is there, near that
statue, talking to Mr. Courtenay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes! she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was there--forty feet away--a hundred miles away! All that
blank space had to be crossed; and then a speech to be made!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, in the most pitiful and pleading voice
possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; make haste about it; there is nothing so formidable in it, is
there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Kirkpatrick, in a sharper voice than before,
aware that they were wanting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) at the piano, and anxious to get the
business in hand done as soon as possible.

<p/>Molly stood still for a minute, then, looking up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, softly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you mind coming with me, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! not I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Kirkpatrick, seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) compliance was
likely to be the most speedy way of getting through the affair; so
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) took Molly's hand, and, on the way, in passing the group at the
piano, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, smiling, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty genteel manner,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our little friend here is shy and modest, and wants me to accompany
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to Lady Cumnor to wish good-night; her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) father has come for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) is going away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly did not know how it was afterwards, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand out
of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's on hearing these words, and going a step or
two in advance came up to Lady Cumnor, grand in purple velvet, and
dropping a curtsey, almost after the fashion of the school-children,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady, papa is come, and I am going away; and, my lady, I wish
you good-night, and thank you for your kindness. Your ladyship's
kindness, I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) said, correcting herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) remembered
Miss Browning's particular instructions as to the etiquette to be
observed to earls and countesses, and their honourable progeny, as
they were given that morning on the road to the Towers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) got out of the saloon somehow; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) believed afterwards, on
thinking about it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had never bidden good-by to Lady
Cuxhaven, or Mrs. Kirkpatrick, or <div class="bookquote">``all the rest of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
irreverently styled them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/>Mr. Gibson was in the housekeeper's room, when Molly ran in, rather
to the stately Mrs. Brown's discomfiture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's neck. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, papa, papa! I am so glad you have
come;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) burst out crying, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face almost
hysterically as if to make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what a noodle you are, Molly! Did you think I was going to give
up my little girl to live at the Towers all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life? You
make as much work about my coming for you, as if you thought I had.
Make haste, now, and get on your bonnet. Mrs. Brown, may I ask you
for a shawl, or a plaid, or a wrap of some kind to pin about her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) for
a petticoat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not mention that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had come home from a long round not half
an hour before, a round from which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had returned dinnerless and
hungry; but, on finding that Molly had not come back from the Towers,
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had ridden his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tired horse round by Miss Brownings', and found
them in self-reproachful, helpless dismay. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not wait to
listen to their tearful apologies; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) galloped home, had a fresh
horse and Molly's pony saddled, and though Betty called after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
with a riding-skirt for the child, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not ten yards from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
own stable-door, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) refused to turn back for it, but went off, as
Dick the stableman said, <div class="bookquote">``muttering to himself awful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stableman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Brown had her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) bottle of wine out, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) plate of cake, before
Molly came back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) long expedition to Mrs. Kirkpatrick's room,
<div class="bookquote">``pretty nigh on to a quarter of a mile off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>as the housekeeper
informed the impatient father, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child to come
down arrayed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) morning's finery with the gloss of newness worn
off. Mr. Gibson was a favourite in all the Towers' household, as
family doctors generally are; bringing hopes of relief at times
of anxiety and distress; and Mrs. Brown, who was subject to gout,
especially delighted in petting him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
even went out into the stable-yard to pin Molly up in the shawl, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sate upon the rough-coated pony, and hazarded the somewhat safe
conjecture,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)'ll be happier at home, Mr. Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as they rode away.

<p/>Once out into the park Molly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pony, and urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) on as
hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would go. Mr. Gibson called out at last:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly! we're coming to the rabbit-holes; it's not safe to go at such
a pace. Stop.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) drew rein he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode up alongside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're getting into the shadow of the trees, and it's not safe riding
fast here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! papa, I never was so glad in all my life. I felt like a lighted
candle when they're putting the extinguisher on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you? How d'ye know what the candle feels?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know, but I did.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And again, after a pause she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
said,--<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am so glad to be here! It is so pleasant riding here in
the open, free, fresh air, crushing out such a good smell from the
dewy grass. Papa! are you there? I can't see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode close up alongside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not sure but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might
be afraid of riding in the dark shadows, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand upon
hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I am so glad to feel you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand hard. <div class="bookquote">``Papa, I
should like to get a chain like Ponto's, just as long as your longest
round, and then I could fasten us two to each end of it, and when I
wanted you I could pull, and if you didn't want to come, you could
pull back again; but I should know you knew I wanted you, and we
could never lose each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm rather lost in that plan of yours; the details, as you state
them, are a little puzzling; but if I make them out rightly, I am to
go about the country, like the donkeys on the common, with a clog
fastened to my hind leg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind your calling me a clog, if only we were fastened
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do mind you calling me a donkey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never did. At least I didn't mean to. But it is such a comfort to
know that I may be as rude as I like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that what you've learnt from the grand company you've been
keeping to-day? I expected to find you so polite and ceremonious,
that I read a few chapters of _Sir Charles Grandison_, in order to
bring myself up to concert pitch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do hope I shall never be a lord or a lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to comfort you, I'll tell you this: I'm sure you'll never be a
lord; and I think the chances are a thousand to one against your ever
being the other, in the sense in which you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should lose myself every time I had to fetch my bonnet, or else
get tired of long passages and great staircases long before I could
go out walking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'd have your lady's-maid, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, papa, I think lady's-maids are worse than ladies. I
should not mind being a housekeeper so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! the jam-cupboards and dessert would lie very conveniently to
one's hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, meditatively. <div class="bookquote">``But Mrs. Brown tells
me that the thought of the dinners often keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) from sleeping;
there's that anxiety to be taken into consideration. Still, in every
condition of life, there are heavy cares and responsibilities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I know Betty says I wear

the cherry-tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Miss Browning said she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) had fretted herself into a headache with

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I went by myself to see the gardens; they are so beautiful! and
I lost myself, and sat down to rest under a great tree; and Lady

she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) would waken me in time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) didn't; and so they'd all gone
away; and when they planned for me to stop till to-morrow, I didn't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it was rather a dismal day of pleasure, goosey, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the morning. I shall never forget the morning in that garden.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson thought it his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) duty to ride round by the Towers, and pay
a visit of apology and thanks to the family, before they left for
London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) found them all on the wing, and no one was sufficiently
at liberty to listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) grateful civilities but Mrs. Kirkpatrick,
who, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was to accompany Lady Cuxhaven, and pay a visit
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) former pupil, made leisure enough to receive Mr. Gibson, on
behalf of the family; and assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) faithful remembrance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) great professional attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) in former days in the most
winning manner.




<p/>CHAPTER III.

<p/>MOLLY GIBSON``S CHILDHOOD.


<p/>Sixteen years before this time, all Hollingford had been disturbed
to its foundations by the intelligence that Mr. Hall, the skilful
doctor, who had attended them all their days, was going to take
a partner. It was no use reasoning to them on the subject; so Mr.
Browning the vicar, Mr. Sheepshanks -LRB-Lord Cumnor's agent-RRB-, and Mr.
Hall himself, the masculine reasoners of the little society, left
off the attempt, feeling that the _Che sarà sarà_ would prove more
silencing to the murmurs than many arguments. Mr. Hall had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>)
faithful patients that, even with the strongest spectacles, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>)
sight was not to be depended upon; and they might have found out for
themselves that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) hearing was very defective, although, on this
point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) obstinately adhered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) own opinion, and was frequently
heard to regret the carelessness of people's communication nowadays,
<div class="bookquote">``like writing on blotting-paper, all the words running into each
other,''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would say. And more than once Mr. Hall had had attacks
of a suspicious nature,--<div class="bookquote">``rheumatism''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hall</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) used to call them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>)
prescribed for himself as if they had been gout--which had prevented
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) immediate attention to imperative summonses. But, blind and deaf,
and rheumatic as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) might be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) was still Mr. Hall the doctor who
could heal all their ailments--unless they died meanwhile--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) had
no right to speak of growing old, and taking a partner.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) went very steadily to work all the same; advertising in medical
journals, reading testimonials, sifting character and qualifications;
and just when the elderly maiden ladies of Hollingford thought that
they had convinced their contemporary that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was as young as ever,
he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) startled them by bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) new partner, Mr. Gibson, to call
upon them, and began <div class="bookquote">``slyly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>as these ladies said, to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
into practice. And <div class="bookquote">``who was this Mr. Gibson?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>they asked, and echo
might answer the question, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) liked, for no one else did. No
one ever in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) life knew anything more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) antecedents than
the Hollingford people might have found out the first day they saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>): that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was tall, grave, rather handsome than otherwise; thin
enough to be called <div class="bookquote">``a very genteel figure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in those days, before
muscular Christianity had come into vogue; speaking with a slight
Scotch accent; and, as one good lady observed, <div class="bookquote">``so very trite in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) conversation,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>by which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) meant sarcastic. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) birth,
parentage, and education,--the favourite conjecture of Hollingford
society was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was the illegitimate son of a Scotch duke, by
a Frenchwoman; and the grounds for this conjecture were these:--He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
spoke with a Scotch accent; therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) must be Scotch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
a very genteel appearance, an elegant figure, and was apt--so his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
ill-wishers said--to give himself airs; therefore, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) father must
have been some person of quality; and, that granted, nothing was
easier than to run this supposition up all the notes of the scale of
the peerage,--baronet, baron, viscount, earl, marquis, duke. Higher
they dared not go, though one old lady, acquainted with English
history, hazarded the remark, that <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) believed that one or two
of the Stuarts--hem--had not always been,--ahem--quite correct in
their--conduct; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) fancied such--ahem--things ran in families.''
 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>But, in popular opinion, Mr. Gibson's father always remained a duke;
nothing more.

<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother must have been a Frenchwoman, because his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hair was
so black; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so sallow; and because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been in Paris.
All this might be true, or might not; nobody ever knew, or found out
anything more about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) than what Mr. Hall told them, namely, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) professional qualifications were as high as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) moral character,
and that both were far above the average, as Mr. Hall had taken pains
to ascertain before introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) patients. The popularity
of this world is as transient as its glory, as Mr. Hall found out
before the first year of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) partnership was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) had plenty of
leisure left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) now to nurse his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) gout and cherish his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) eyesight.
The younger doctor had carried the day; nearly every one sent for
Mr. Gibson. Even at the great houses--even at the Towers, that
greatest of all, where Mr. Hall had introduced his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) new partner with
fear and trembling, with untold anxiety as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) behaviour, and
the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) might make on my lord the Earl, and my lady the
Countess, Mr. Gibson was received at the end of a twelvemonth with as
much welcome respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) professional skill as Mr. Hall himself
had ever been. Nay--and this was a little too much for even the kind
old doctor's good temper--Mr. Gibson had even been invited once to
dinner at the Towers, to dine with the great Sir Astley, the head of
the profession! To be sure, Mr. Hall had been asked as well; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>)
was laid up just then with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) gout -LRB-since he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) had had a partner the
rheumatism had been allowed to develope itself-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) had not been
able to go. Poor Mr. Hall never quite got over this mortification;
after it he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) allowed himself to become dim of sight and hard of
hearing, and kept pretty closely to the house during the two winters
that remained of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) sent for an orphan grand-niece to keep
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) company in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) old age; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>), the woman-contemning old bachelor,
became thankful for the cheerful presence of the pretty, bonny Mary
Pearson, who was good and sensible, and nothing more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pearson</b></font>) formed
a close friendship with the daughters of the vicar, Mr. Browning,
and Mr. Gibson found time to become very intimate with all three.
Hollingford speculated much on which young lady would become Mrs.
Gibson, and was rather sorry when the talk about possibilities, and
the gossip about probabilities, with regard to the handsome young
surgeon's marriage, ended in the most natural manner in the world, by
his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) marrying his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) predecessor's niece. The two Miss Brownings showed
no signs of going into a consumption on the occasion, although
their looks and manners were carefully watched. On the contrary,
they were rather boisterously merry at the wedding, and poor Mrs.
Gibson it was that died of consumption, four or five years after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
marriage--three years after the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) great-uncle, and when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) only child, Molly, was just three years old.

<p/>Mr. Gibson did not speak much about the grief at the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
wife, which it was supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) avoided all
demonstrations of sympathy, and got up hastily and left the room
when Miss Phoebe Browning first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) loss, and burst
into an uncontrollable flood of tears, which threatened to end in
hysterics. Miss Browning declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) never could forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
hard-heartedness on that occasion; but a fortnight afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)
came to very high words with old Mrs. Goodenough, for gasping out her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>)
doubts whether Mr. Gibson was a man of deep feeling; judging by the
narrowness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) crape hat-band, which ought to have covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
hat, whereas there was at least three inches of beaver to be seen.
And, in spite of it all, Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe considered
themselves as Mr. Gibson's most intimate friends, in right of their
regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) dead wife, and would fain have taken a quasi-motherly
interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) little girl, had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not been guarded by a watchful
dragon in the shape of Betty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) nurse, who was jealous of any
interference between her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) charge; and especially resentful and
disagreeable towards all those ladies who, by suitable age, rank, or
propinquity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) thought capable of <div class="bookquote">``casting sheep's eyes at master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Several years before the opening of this story, Mr. Gibson's position
seemed settled for life, both socially and professionally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
a widower, and likely to remain so; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) domestic affections were
centred on little Molly, but even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), in their most private
moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not give way to much expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) feelings;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) most caressing appellation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``Goosey,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took a
pleasure in bewildering her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) infant mind with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) badinage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
rather a contempt for demonstrative people, arising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) medical
insight into the consequences to health of uncontrolled feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
deceived himself into believing that still his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reason was lord of
all, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had never fallen into the habit of expression on any
other than purely intellectual subjects. Molly, however, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
intuitions to guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) papa laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), quizzed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
joked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), in a way which the Miss Brownings called <div class="bookquote">``really cruel''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brownings/Brownings</b></font>)</div>to each other when they were quite alone, Molly took her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) little
griefs and pleasures, and poured them into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) papa's ears, sooner
even than into Betty's, that kind-hearted termagant. The child grew
to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) father well, and the two had the most delightful
intercourse together--half banter, half seriousness, but altogether
confidential friendship. Mr. Gibson kept three servants; Betty, a
cook, and a girl who was supposed to be housemaid, but who was under
both the elder two, and had a pretty life of it in consequence.
Three servants would not have been required if it had not been Mr.
Gibson's habit, as it had been Mr. Hall's before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>), to take two
<div class="bookquote">``pupils''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as they were called in the genteel language of Hollingford,
<div class="bookquote">``apprentices''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as they were in fact--being bound by indentures, and
paying a handsome premium to learn their business. They lived in the
house, and occupied an uncomfortable, ambiguous, or, as Miss Browning
called it with some truth, <div class="bookquote">``amphibious''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>position. They had their
meals with Mr. Gibson and Molly, and were felt to be terribly in the
way; Mr. Gibson not being a man who could make conversation, and
hating the duty of talking under restraint. Yet something within him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wince, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) duties were not rightly performed, when,
as the cloth was drawn, the two awkward lads rose up with joyful
alacrity, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) a nod, which was to be interpreted as a bow,
knocked against each other in their endeavours to get out of the
dining-room quickly; and then might be heard dashing along a passage
which led to the surgery, choking with half-suppressed laughter. Yet
the annoyance he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt at this dull sense of imperfectly fulfilled
duties only made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sarcasms on their inefficiency, or stupidity, or
ill manners, more bitter than before.

<p/>Beyond direct professional instruction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not know what to do
with the succession of pairs of young men, whose mission seemed to
be, to be plagued by their master consciously, and to plague him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
unconsciously. Once or twice Mr. Gibson had declined taking a fresh
pupil, in the hopes of shaking himself free from the incubus, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
reputation as a clever surgeon had spread so rapidly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fees
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had thought prohibitory, were willingly paid, in order that
the young man might make a start in life, with the prestige of having
been a pupil of Gibson of Hollingford. But as Molly grew to be a
little girl instead of a child, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was about eight years old,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father perceived the awkwardness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) having her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) breakfasts
and dinners so often alone with the pupils, without his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uncertain
presence. To do away with this evil, more than for the actual
instruction she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could give, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) engaged a respectable woman, the
daughter of a shopkeeper in the town, who had left a destitute
family, to come every morning before breakfast, and to stay with
Molly till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came home at night; or, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was detained, until the
child's bed-time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Miss Eyre,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), summing up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) instructions the day before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) entered upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) office, <div class="bookquote">``remember this: you are to make good tea
for the young men, and see that they have their meals comfortably,
and--you are five-and-thirty, I think you said?--try and make them
talk,--rationally, I am afraid is beyond your or anybody's power; but
make them talk without stammering or giggling. Don't teach Molly too
much: she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must sew, and read, and write, and do her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sums; but I want
to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a child, and if I find more learning desirable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
I'll see about giving it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) myself. After all, I'm not sure that
reading or writing is necessary. Many a good woman gets married
with only a cross instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name; it's rather a diluting
of mother-wit, to my fancy; but, however, we must yield to the
prejudices of society, Miss Eyre, and so you may teach the child to
read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Eyre listened in silence, perplexed but determined to be
obedient to the directions of the doctor, whose kindness she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) family had good cause to know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) made strong tea; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) helped
the young men liberally in Mr. Gibson's absence, as well as in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
presence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) found the way to unloosen their tongues, whenever
their master was away, by talking to them on trivial subjects in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>)
pleasant homely way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) taught Molly to read and write, but tried
honestly to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) back in every other branch of education. It was
only by fighting and struggling hard, that bit by bit Molly persuaded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) have French and drawing lessons. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was always
afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) becoming too much educated, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) need not have
been alarmed; the masters who visited such small country towns as
Hollingford forty years ago, were no such great proficients in their
arts. Once a week she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) joined a dancing class in the assembly-room
at the principal inn in the town: the <div class="bookquote">``George;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and, being daunted
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father in every intellectual attempt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) read every book
that came in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) way, almost with as much delight as if it had been
forbidden. For his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) station in life, Mr. Gibson had an unusually
good library; the medical portion of it was inaccessible to Molly,
being kept in the surgery, but every other book she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had either read,
or tried to read. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) summer place of study was that seat in the
cherry-tree, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) got the green stains on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) frock, that have
already been mentioned as likely to wear Betty's life out. In spite
of this <div class="bookquote">``hidden worm i' th' bud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betty</b></font>)</div>Betty was to all appearance strong,
alert, and flourishing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) was the one crook in Miss Eyre's lot,
who was otherwise so happy in having met with a suitable well-paid
employment just when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) needed it most. But Betty, though agreeing
in theory with her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) master when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) of the necessity of having
a governess for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) little daughter, was vehemently opposed to any
division of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) authority and influence over the child who had been
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) charge, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) plague, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) delight ever since Mrs. Gibson's
death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) position as censor of all Miss Eyre's sayings
and doings from the very first, and did not for a moment condescend
to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) disapprobation. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) could not help
respecting the patience and painstaking of the good lady,--for
a <div class="bookquote">``lady''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Miss Eyre was in the best sense of the word, though in
Hollingford she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) only took rank as a shopkeeper's daughter. Yet Betty
buzzed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) with the teasing pertinacity of a gnat, always ready
to find fault, if not to bite. Miss Eyre's only defence came from the
quarter whence it might least have been expected--from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) pupil; on
whose fancied behalf, as an oppressed little personage, Betty always
based her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) attacks. But very early in the day Molly perceived their
injustice, and soon afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began to respect Miss Eyre for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>)
silent endurance of what evidently gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) far more pain than Betty
imagined. Mr. Gibson had been a friend in need to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) family, so Miss
Eyre restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) complaints, sooner than annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) had
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) reward. Betty would offer Molly all sorts of small temptations to
neglect Miss Eyre's wishes; Molly steadily resisted, and plodded away
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) task of sewing or her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) difficult sum. Betty made cumbrous jokes
at Miss Eyre's expense; Molly looked up with the utmost gravity, as
if requesting the explanation of an unintelligible speech; and there
is nothing so quenching to a wag as to be asked to translate his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
jest into plain matter-of-fact English, and to show wherein the
point lies. Occasionally Betty lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) temper entirely, and spoke
impertinently to Miss Eyre; but when this had been done in Molly's
presence, the girl flew out into such a violent passion of words
in defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) silent trembling governess, that even Betty
herself was daunted, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) chose to take the child's anger as
a good joke, and tried to persuade Miss Eyre herself to join in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>)
amusement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless the child! one `ud think I was a hungry pussy-cat, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
a hen-sparrow, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wings all fluttering, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little eyes
aflame, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beak ready to peck me just because I happened to
look near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nest. Nay, child! if thou lik`st to be stifled in a
nasty close room, learning things as is of no earthly good when they
is learnt, instead o' riding on Job Donkin's hay-cart, it's thy
look-out, not mine. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a little vixen, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Eyre</b></font>)</div>smiling at
Miss Eyre, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) speech. But the poor governess saw no
humour in the affair; the comparison of Molly to a hen-sparrow was
lost upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sensitive and conscientious, and knew, from
home experience, the evils of an ungovernable temper. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began to
reprove Molly for giving way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) passion, and the child thought
it hard to be blamed for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) just anger against
Betty. But, after all, these were the small grievances of a very
happy childhood.




<p/>CHAPTER IV.

<p/>MR. GIBSON``S NEIGHBOURS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>Molly grew up among these quiet people in calm monotony of life,
without any greater event than that which has been recorded--the
being left behind at the Towers--until she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was nearly seventeen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had become a visitor at the school, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had never gone again to
the annual festival at the great house; it was easy to find some
excuse for keeping away, and the recollection of that day was not
a pleasant one on the whole, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) often thought how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
should like to see the gardens again.

<p/>Lady Agnes was married; there was only Lady Harriet remaining at
home; Lord Hollingford, the eldest son, had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wife, and was
a good deal more at the Towers since he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had become a widower. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
was a tall ungainly man, considered to be as proud as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mother,
the countess; but, in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was only shy, and slow at making
commonplace speeches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) did not know what to say to people whose
daily habits and interests were not the same as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would have
been very thankful for a handbook of small-talk, and would have
learnt off his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sentences with good-humoured diligence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) often
envied the fluency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) garrulous father, who delighted in talking
to everybody, and was perfectly unconscious of the incoherence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
conversation. But, owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) constitutional reserve and shyness,
Lord Hollingford was not a popular man although his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) kindness of
heart was very great, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) simplicity of character extreme, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>)
scientific acquirements considerable enough to entitle him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) to much
reputation in the European republic of learned men. In this respect
Hollingford was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>). The inhabitants knew that the great,
grave, clumsy heir to its fealty was highly esteemed for his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) wisdom;
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) had made one or two discoveries, though in what direction
they were not quite sure. But it was safe to point him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) out to
strangers visiting the little town, as <div class="bookquote">``That's Lord Hollingford--the
famous Lord Hollingford, you know; you must have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) is
so scientific.''  (<font color='red'><b>strangers</b></font>)</div>If the strangers knew his (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>) name, they also knew his (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>)
claims to fame; if they did not, ten to one but they would make as
if they did, and so conceal not only their own ignorance, but that
of their companions, as to the exact nature of the sources of his (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>)
reputation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>) was left a widower with two or three boys. They were at a public
school; so that their companionship could make the house in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>) had passed his (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>) married life but little of a home to him (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>)
consequently spent much of his (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>) time at the Towers; where his (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>) mother
was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>) father very fond, but ever so little afraid
of him (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>GIBSON</b></font>) friends were always welcomed by Lord and Lady Cumnor; the
former, indeed, was in the habit of welcoming everybody everywhere;
but it was a proof of Lady Cumnor's real affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
distinguished son, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to ask what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``all
sorts of people''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to the Towers. <div class="bookquote">``All sorts of people''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hall</b></font>)</div>meant really
those who were distinguished for science and learning, without regard
to rank: and it must be confessed, without much regard to polished
manners likewise.

<p/>Mr. Hall, Mr. Gibson's predecessor, had always been received with
friendly condescension by my lady, who had found him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) established as
the family medical man, when first she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to the Towers on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
marriage; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never thought of interfering with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) custom of
taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) meals, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) needed refreshment, in the housekeeper's
room, not _with_ the housekeeper, _bien entendu_. The comfortable,
clever, stout, and red-faced doctor would very much have preferred
this, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had had the choice given him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) never had-RRB- of
taking his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``snack,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) called it, with my lord and my lady, in the
grand dining-room. Of course, if some great surgical gun -LRB-like Sir
Astley-RRB- was brought down from London to bear on the family's health,
it was due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Astley</b></font>), as well as to the local medical attendant, to ask
Mr. Hall to dinner, in a formal and ceremonious manner, on which
occasions Mr. Hall buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) chin in voluminous folds of white
muslin, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) black knee-breeches, with bunches of ribbon at
the sides, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) silk stockings and buckled shoes, and otherwise made
himself excessively uncomfortable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) attire, and went forth in
state in a post-chaise from the <div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hall</b></font>)</div>consoling himself in the
private corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) heart for the discomfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) was enduring with
the idea of how well it would sound the next day in the ears of the
squires whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) was in the habit of attending: <div class="bookquote">``Yesterday at dinner
the earl said,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``the countess remarked,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``I was surprised to
hear when I was dining at the Towers yesterday.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But somehow things
had changed since Mr. Gibson had become <div class="bookquote">``the doctor''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>_par excellence_
at Hollingford. Miss Brownings thought that it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
such an elegant figure, and <div class="bookquote">``such a distinguished manner;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Goodenough, <div class="bookquote">``because of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) aristocratic connections'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``the son of a
Scotch duke, my dear, never mind on which side of the blanket.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>But
the fact was certain; although he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might frequently ask Mrs. Brown
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) something to eat in the housekeeper's room--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had no
time for all the fuss and ceremony of luncheon with my lady--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
always welcome to the grandest circle of visitors in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
might lunch with a duke any day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) chose; given that a duke was
forthcoming at the Towers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) accent was Scotch, not provincial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
had not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) bones; and leanness goes
a great way to gentility. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) complexion was sallow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hair
black; in those days, the decade after the conclusion of the great
continental war, to be sallow and black-a-vised was of itself a
distinction; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not jovial -LRB-as my lord remarked with a sigh, but
it was my lady who endorsed the invitations-RRB-, sparing of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) words,
intelligent, and slightly sarcastic. Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was perfectly
presentable.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) Scotch blood -LRB-for that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was of Scottish descent there could be
no manner of doubt-RRB- gave him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) just the kind of thistly dignity which
made every one feel that they must treat him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) with respect; so on that
head he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was assured. The grandeur of being an invited guest to dinner
at the Towers from time to time, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) but little pleasure for
many years, but it was a form to be gone through in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
profession, without any idea of social gratification.

<p/>But when Lord Hollingford returned to make the Towers his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) home,
affairs were altered. Mr. Gibson really heard and learnt things that
interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) seriously, and that gave fresh flavour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reading.
From time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) met the leaders of the scientific world;
odd-looking, simple-hearted men, very much in earnest about their
own particular subjects, and not having much to say on any other. Mr.
Gibson found himself capable of appreciating such persons, and also
perceived that they valued his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) appreciation, as it was honestly
and intelligently given. Indeed, by-and-by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) began to send
contributions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own to the more scientific of the medical
journals, and thus partly in receiving, partly in giving out
information and accurate thought, a new zest was added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) life.
There was not much intercourse between Lord Hollingford and himself;
the one was too silent and shy, the other too busy, to seek each
other's society with the perseverance required to do away with the
social distinction of rank that prevented their frequent meetings.
But each was thoroughly pleased to come into contact with the other.
Each could rely on the other's respect and sympathy with a security
unknown to many who call themselves friends; and this was a source
of happiness to both; to Mr. Gibson the most so, of course; for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) range of intelligent and cultivated society was the smaller.
Indeed, there was no one equal to himself among the men with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
associated, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had felt as a depressing influence, although
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) never recognized the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) depression. There was Mr.
Ashton, the vicar, who had succeeded Mr. Browning, a thoroughly good
and kind-hearted man, but one without an original thought in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);
whose habitual courtesy and indolent mind led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to agree to every
opinion, not palpably heterodox, and to utter platitudes in the most
gentlemanly manner. Mr. Gibson had once or twice amused himself, by
leading the vicar on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) agreeable admissions of arguments <div class="bookquote">``as
perfectly convincing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>and of statements as <div class="bookquote">``curious but undoubted,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had planted the poor clergyman in a bog of heretical
bewilderment. But then Mr. Ashton's pain and suffering at suddenly
finding out into what a theological predicament he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) had been brought,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) real self-reproach at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) previous admissions, were so great
that Mr. Gibson lost all sense of fun, and hastened back to the
Thirty-nine Articles with all the good-will in life, as the only
means of soothing the vicar's conscience. On any other subject,
except that of orthodoxy, Mr. Gibson could lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) any lengths; but
then his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ignorance on most of them prevented bland acquiescence from
arriving at any results which could startle him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had some private
fortune, and was not married, and lived the life of an indolent and
refined bachelor; but though he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) himself was no very active visitor
among his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) poorer parishioners, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was always willing to relieve their
wants in the most liberal, and, considering his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) habits, occasionally
in the most self-denying manner, whenever Mr. Gibson, or any one
else, made them clearly known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Use my purse as freely as if
it was your own, Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was wont to say. <div class="bookquote">``I'm such a bad one at
going about and making talk to poor folk--I daresay I don't do enough
in that way--but I am most willing to give you anything for any one
you may consider in want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; I come upon you pretty often, I believe, and make very
little scruple about it; but if you'll allow me to suggest, it is,
that you shouldn't try to make talk when you go into the cottages;
but just talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see the difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>said the vicar, a little querulously;
<div class="bookquote">``but I daresay there is a difference, and I have no doubt what you
say is quite true. I shouldn't make talk, but talk; and as both are
equally difficult to me, you must let me purchase the privilege of
silence by this ten-pound note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. It's not so satisfactory to me; and, I should think, not
to yourself. But probably the Joneses and Greens will prefer it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ashton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Ashton would look with plaintive inquiry into Mr. Gibson's face
after some such speech, as if asking if a sarcasm was intended. On
the whole, they went on in the most amicable way; only beyond the
gregarious feeling common to most men, they had very little actual
pleasure in each other's society. Perhaps the man of all others
to whom Mr. Gibson took the most kindly--at least, until Lord
Hollingford came into the neighbourhood--was a certain Squire Hamley.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) ancestors had been called squire as long back as local
tradition extended. But there was many a greater land-owner in the
county, for Squire Hamley's estate was not more than eight hundred
acres or so. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) family had been in possession of it long before
the Earls of Cumnor had been heard of; before the Hely-Harrisons
had bought Coldstone Park; no one in Hollingford knew the time when
the Hamleys had not lived at Hamley. <div class="bookquote">``Ever since the Heptarchy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>said the vicar. <div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, <div class="bookquote">``I have heard that there
were Hamleys of Hamley before the Romans.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>The vicar was preparing
a polite assent, when Mrs. Goodenough came in with a still more
startling assertion. <div class="bookquote">``I have always heerd,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>), with all the
slow authority of an oldest inhabitant, <div class="bookquote">``that there was Hamleys of
Hamley afore the time of the pagans.''  (<font color='red'><b>an inhabitant</b></font>)</div>Mr. Ashton could only bow, and
say, <div class="bookquote">``Possibly, very possibly, madam.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ashton</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) said it in so courteous
a manner that Mrs. Goodenough looked round in a gratified way, as
much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``The Church confirms my words; who now will dare
dispute them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>At any rate, the Hamleys were a very old family, if
not aborigines. They had not increased their estate for centuries;
they had held their own, if even with an effort, and had not sold
a rood of it for the last hundred years or so. But they were not
an adventurous race. They never traded, or speculated, or tried
agricultural improvements of any kind. They had no capital in any
bank; nor what perhaps would have been more in character, hoards of
gold in any stocking. Their mode of life was simple, and more like
that of yeomen than squires. Indeed Squire Hamley, by continuing the
primitive manners and customs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) forefathers, the squires of the
eighteenth century, did live more as a yeoman, when such a class
existed, than as a squire of this generation. There was a dignity in
this quiet conservatism that gained him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) an immense amount of respect
both from high and low; and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) might have visited at every house
in the county had he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) so chosen. But he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was very indifferent to the
charms of society; and perhaps this was owing to the fact that the
squire, Roger Hamley, who at present lived and reigned at Hamley,
had not received so good an education as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) ought to have done.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father, Squire Stephen, had been plucked at Oxford, and, with
stubborn pride, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had refused to go up again. Nay, more! he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
sworn a great oath, as men did in those days, that none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
children to come should ever know either university by becoming a
member of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had only one child, the present Squire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was
brought up according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father's word; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was sent to a petty
provincial school, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) saw much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hated, and then turned
loose upon the estate as its heir. Such a bringing up did not do him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
all the harm that might have been anticipated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was imperfectly
educated, and ignorant on many points; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
deficiency, and regretted it in theory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was awkward and ungainly
in society, and so kept out of it as much as possible; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was
obstinate, violent-tempered, and dictatorial in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own immediate
circle. On the other side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was generous, and true as steel; the
very soul of honour, in fact. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had so much natural shrewdness, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) conversation was always worth listening to, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was apt
to start by assuming entirely false premises, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) considered
as incontrovertible as if they had been mathematically proved; but,
given the correctness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) premises, nobody could bring more
natural wit and sense to bear upon the arguments based upon them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had married a delicate fine London lady; it was one of those
perplexing marriages of which one cannot understand the reasons. Yet
they were very happy, though possibly Mrs. Hamley would not have sunk
into the condition of a chronic invalid, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) husband had cared a
little more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) various tastes, or allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) the companionship
of those who did. After his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was wont to say he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had got
all that was worth having out of the crowd of houses they called
London. It was a compliment to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) repeated until the
year of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death; it charmed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at first, it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up to the
last time of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hearing it; but, for all that, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) used sometimes
to wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would recognize the fact that there might still be
something worth hearing and seeing in the great city. But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never
went there again, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not prohibit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) going, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
showed so little sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came back full of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) visit that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ceased caring to go. Not but what
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was kind and willing in giving his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) consent, and in furnishing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
amply with money. <div class="bookquote">``There, there, my little woman, take that! Dress
yourself up as fine as any on 'em, and buy what you like, for the
credit of Hamley of Hamley; and go to the park and the play, and show
off with the best on 'em. I shall be glad to see thee back again, I
know; but have thy fling while thou`rt about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came
back it was, <div class="bookquote">``Well, well, it has pleased thee, I suppose, so that's
all right. But the very talking about it tires me, I know, and I
can't think how you have stood it all. Come out and see how pretty
the flowers are looking in the south garden. I've made them sow all
the seeds you like; and I went over to Hollingford nursery to buy the
cuttings of the plants you admired last year. A breath of fresh air
will clear my brain after listening to all this talk about the whirl
of London, which is like to have turned me giddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hamley was a great reader, and had considerable literary taste.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was gentle and sentimental; tender and good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
visits to London; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sociable pleasure in the company
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) fellows in education and position. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) husband, owing to the
deficiencies of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) early years, disliked associating with those
to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ought to have been an equal; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was too proud to mingle
with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) inferiors. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife all the more dearly for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
sacrifices for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); but, deprived of all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) strong interests, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
sank into ill-health; nothing definite; only she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never was well.
Perhaps if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had had a daughter it would have been better for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>):
but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) two children were boys, and their father, anxious to give
them the advantages of which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) himself had suffered the deprivation,
sent the lads very early to a preparatory school. They were to go
on to Rugby and Cambridge; the idea of Oxford was hereditarily
distasteful in the Hamley family. Osborne, the eldest--so called
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) mother's maiden name--was full of taste, and had some
talent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) appearance had all the grace and refinement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
mother's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was sweet-tempered and affectionate, almost as
demonstrative as a girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) did well at school, carrying away many
prizes; and was, in a word, the pride and delight of both father and
mother; the confidential friend of the latter, in default of any
other. Roger was two years younger than Osborne; clumsy and heavily
built, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) father; his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) face was square, and the expression
grave, and rather immobile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was good, but dull, his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) schoolmasters
said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) won no prizes, but brought home a favourable report of his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
conduct. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) caressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used laughingly to allude
to the fable of the lap-dog and the donkey; so thereafter he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) left
off all personal demonstration of affection. It was a great question
as to whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) brother to college after he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
left Rugby. Mrs. Hamley thought it would be rather a throwing
away of money, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was so little likely to distinguish himself
in intellectual pursuits; anything practical--such as a civil
engineer--would be more the kind of life for him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thought that
it would be too mortifying for him (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) to go to the same college and
university as his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) brother, who was sure to distinguish himself--and,
to be repeatedly plucked, to come away wooden-spoon at last. But his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)
father persevered doggedly, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) wont, in his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) intention of
giving both his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) sons the same education; they should both have the
advantages of which he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) had been deprived. If Roger did not do well at
Cambridge it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own fault. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father did not send him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
thither, some day or other he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might be regretting the omission, as
the Squire had done himself for many a year. So Roger followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
brother Osborne to Trinity, and Mrs. Hamley was again left alone,
after the year of indecision as to Roger's destination, which had
been brought on by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) urgency. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had not been able for many years
to walk beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) garden; the greater part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) life was spent on
a sofa, wheeled to the window in summer, to the fireside in winter.
The room which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) inhabited was large and pleasant; four tall
windows looked out upon a lawn dotted over with flower-beds, and
melting away into a small wood, in the centre of which there was a
pond, filled with water-lilies. About this unseen pond in the deep
shade Mrs. Hamley had written many a pretty four-versed poem since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sofa, alternately reading and composing verse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had
a small table by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) side on which there were the newest works of
poetry and fiction; a pencil and blotting-book, with loose sheets
of blank paper; a vase of flowers always of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) husband's gathering;
winter and summer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had a sweet fresh nosegay every day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) maid
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) a draught of medicine every three hours, with a glass of
clear water and a biscuit; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) husband came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) as often as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
love for the open air and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) labours out-of-doors permitted; but
the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) day, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) boys were absent, was Mr. Gibson's
frequent professional visits.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew there was real secret harm going on all this time that people
spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) as a merely fanciful invalid; and that one or two
accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of humouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) fancies. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) only smiled at such
accusations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) visits were a real pleasure and
lightening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) growing and indescribable discomfort; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew that
Squire Hamley would have been only too glad if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had come every day;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was conscious that by careful watching of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) symptoms he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
might mitigate her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) bodily pain. Besides all these reasons, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) took
great pleasure in the Squire's society. Mr. Gibson enjoyed the
other's unreasonableness; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) quaintness; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) strong conservatism
in religion, politics, and morals. Mrs. Hamley tried sometimes to
apologize for, or to soften away, opinions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) fancied were
offensive to the doctor, or contradictions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thought too
abrupt; but at such times her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) husband would lay his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) great hand almost
caressingly on Mr. Gibson's shoulder, and soothe his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife's anxiety,
by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Let us alone, little woman. We understand each other,
don't we, doctor? Why, bless your life, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) gives me better than he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
gets many a time; only, you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sugars it over, and says a sharp
thing, and pretends it's all civility and humility; but I can tell
when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s giving me a pill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>One of Mrs. Hamley's often-expressed wishes had been, that Molly
might come and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a visit. Mr. Gibson always refused this
request of hers, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could hardly have given his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reasons for
these refusals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not want to lose the companionship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
child, in fact; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) put it to himself in quite a different way.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lessons and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) regular course of employment would be
interrupted. The life in Mrs. Hamley's heated and scented room would
not be good for the girl; Osborne and Roger Hamley would be at home,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) did not wish Molly to be thrown too exclusively upon them for
young society; or they would not be at home, and it would be rather
dull and depressing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) girl to be all the day long with a
nervous invalid.

<p/>But at length the day came when Mr. Gibson rode over, and volunteered
a visit from Molly; an offer which Mrs. Hamley received with the
<div class="bookquote">``open arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) expressed it; and of which the
duration was unspecified.

<p/>The cause for the change in Mr. Gibson's wishes just referred to
was as follows:--It has been mentioned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took pupils, rather
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) inclination, it is true; but there they were, a Mr. Wynne
and Mr. Coxe, <div class="bookquote">``the young gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>as they were called in the
household; <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gibson's young gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>as they were termed in the
town. Mr. Wynne was the elder, the more experienced one, who could
occasionally take his (<font color='blue'><b>Wynne</b></font>) master's place, and who gained experience by
visiting the poor, and the <div class="bookquote">``chronic cases.''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gibson used to talk
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) practice with Mr. Wynne, and try and elicit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) opinions in
the vain hope that, some day or another, Mr. Wynne might start an
original thought. The young man was cautious and slow; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wynne</b></font>) would never
do any harm by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wynne</b></font>) rashness, but at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Wynne</b></font>) would always be
a little behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Wynne</b></font>) day. Still Mr. Gibson remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had had
far worse <div class="bookquote">``young gentlemen''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to deal with; and was content with, if
not thankful for, such an elder pupil as Mr. Wynne. Mr. Coxe was a
boy of nineteen or so, with brilliant red hair, and a tolerably red
face, of both of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was very conscious and much ashamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was
the son of an Indian officer, an old acquaintance of Mr. Gibson's.
Major Coxe was at some unpronounceable station in the Punjaub, at the
present time; but the year before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been in England, and had
repeatedly expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) great satisfaction at having placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) only
child as a pupil to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) old friend, and had in fact almost charged
Mr. Gibson with the guardianship as well as the instruction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
boy, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) many injunctions which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought were special in
this case; but which Mr. Gibson with a touch of annoyance assured the
major were always attended to in every case, with every pupil. But
when the poor major ventured to beg that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) boy might be considered
as one of the family, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) evenings in the
drawing-room instead of the surgery, Mr. Gibson turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with
a direct refusal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) must live like the others. I can't have the pestle and mortar
carried into the drawing-room, and the place smelling of aloes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must my boy make pills himself, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the major, ruefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. The youngest apprentice always does. It's not hard
work. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll have the comfort of thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won't have to swallow
them himself. And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll have the run of the pomfret cakes, and the
conserve of hips, and on Sundays he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shall have a taste of tamarinds
to reward him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) weekly labour at pill-making.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div><p/>Major Coxe was not quite sure whether Mr. Gibson was not laughing
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sleeve; but things were so far arranged, and the real
advantages were so great, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought it was best to take no
notice, but even to submit to the indignity of pill-making. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
consoled for all these rubs by Mr. Gibson's manner at last when the
supreme moment of final parting arrived. The doctor did not say much;
but there was something of real sympathy in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) manner that spoke
straight to the father's heart, and an implied <div class="bookquote">``you have trusted me
with your boy, and I have accepted the trust in full,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>in each of the
few last words.

<p/>Mr. Gibson knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) business and human nature too well to distinguish
young Coxe by any overt marks of favouritism; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could not help
showing the lad occasionally that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with especial
interest as the son of a friend. Besides this claim upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) regard,
there was something about the young man himself that pleased Mr.
Gibson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was rash and impulsive, apt to speak, hitting the nail on
the head sometimes with unconscious cleverness, at other times making
gross and startling blunders. Mr. Gibson used to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
motto would always be <div class="bookquote">``kill or cure,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and to this Mr. Coxe once made
answer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) thought it was the best motto a doctor could have; for
if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could not cure the patient, it was surely best to get him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) misery quietly, and at once. Mr. Wynne looked up in surprise,
and observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wynne</b></font>) should be afraid that such putting out of misery
might be looked upon as homicide by some people. Mr. Gibson said
in a dry tone, that for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) part he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) should not mind the imputation
of homicide, but that it would not do to make away with profitable
patients in so speedy a manner; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought that as long as
they were willing and able to pay two-and-sixpence for the doctor's
visit, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) duty to keep them alive; of course, when they
became paupers the case was different. Mr. Wynne pondered over this
speech; Mr. Coxe only laughed. At last Mr. Wynne said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you go every morning, sir, before breakfast to see old Nancy
Grant, and you've ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) this medicine, sir, which is about the
most costly in Corbyn's bill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wynne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you not found out how difficult it is for men to live up to
their precepts? You've a great deal to learn yet, Mr. Wynne!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Gibson, leaving the surgery as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never can make the governor out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wynne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wynne, in a tone of
utter despair. <div class="bookquote">``What are you laughing at, Coxey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh! I'm thinking how blest you are in having parents who have
instilled moral principles into your youthful bosom. You'd go and be
poisoning all the paupers off, if you hadn't been told that murder
was a crime by your mother; you'd be thinking you were doing as you
were bid, and quote old Gibson's words when you came to be tried.
<div class="bookquote">``Please, my lord judge, they were not able to pay for my visits, and
so I followed the rules of the profession as taught me by Mr. Gibson,
the great surgeon at Hollingford, and poisoned the paupers.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear that scoffing way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I like it. If it wasn't for the governor's fun, and the
tamarinds, and something else that I know of, I would run off to
India. I hate stifling rooms, and sick people, and the smell of
drugs, and the stink of pills on my hands;--faugh!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V.

<p/>CALF-LOVE.


<p/>One day, for some reason or other, Mr. Gibson came home unexpectedly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was crossing the hall, having come in by the garden-door--the
garden communicated with the stable-yard, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
horse--when the kitchen door opened, and the girl who was underling
in the establishment, came quickly into the hall with a note in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hand, and made as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was taking it upstairs; but on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
master she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave a little start, and turned back as if to hide herself
in the kitchen. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not made this movement, so conscious of
guilt, Mr. Gibson, who was anything but suspicious, would never have
taken any notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stepped quickly forwards,
opened the kitchen door, and called out <div class="bookquote">``Bethia''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>so sharply that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
could not delay coming forwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me that note,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hesitated a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's for Miss Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stammered out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) repeated more quickly than before. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would cry; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept the note tight held behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said as I was to give it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own hands; and I promised as I
would, faithful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cook, go and find Miss Molly. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to come here at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fixed Bethia with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes. It was of no use trying to escape: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
might have thrown it into the fire, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not presence of mind
enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood immovable, only her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes looked any way rather than
encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) master's steady gaze. <div class="bookquote">``Molly, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa! I did not know you were at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said innocent, wondering
Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bethia, keep your word. Here is Miss Molly; give her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) the note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, miss, I couldn't help it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly took the note, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could open it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father
said,--<div class="bookquote">``That's all, my dear; you needn't read it. Give it to me. Tell
those who sent you, Bethia, that all letters for Miss Molly must pass
through my hands. Now be off with you, goosey, and go back to where
you came from.''


 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: A LOVE LETTER.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I shall make you tell me who my correspondent is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see about that, by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went a little reluctantly, with ungratified curiosity, upstairs
to Miss Eyre, who was still her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) daily companion, if not her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>)
governess. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) turned into the empty dining-room, shut the door,
broke the seal of the note, and began to read it. It was a flaming
love-letter from Mr. Coxe; who professed himself unable to go on
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) day after day without speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) of the passion she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>)
had inspired--an <div class="bookquote">``eternal passion,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) called it; on reading which
Mr. Gibson laughed a little. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) not look kindly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)? would
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) not think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) whose only thought was of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>)? and so on, with a
very proper admixture of violent compliments to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) was
fair, not pale; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) eyes were loadstars, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) dimples marks of Cupid's
finger, &c.

<p/>Mr. Gibson finished reading it; and began to think about it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
own mind. ``Who would have thought the lad had been so poetical? but,
to be sure, there's a ``Shakspeare' in the surgery library: I'll take
it away and put <div class="bookquote">``Johnson's Dictionary' instead. One comfort is the
conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) perfect innocence--ignorance, I should rather
say--for it's easy to see it's the first `confession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) love,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) calls it. But it's an awful worry--to begin with lovers so early.
Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>)'s only just seventeen,--not seventeen, indeed, till July;
not for six weeks yet. Sixteen and three-quarters! Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>)'s quite
a baby. To be sure--poor Jeanie was not so old, and how I did love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanie</b></font>)!'' -LRB-Mrs. Gibson's name was Mary, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) must have been referring to
some one else.-RRB- Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thoughts wandered back to other days, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) still held the open note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand. By-and-by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes fell upon
it again, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind came back to bear upon the present time. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
not be hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>). I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) a hint; he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)'s quite sharp enough
to take it. Poor laddie! if I send him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) away, which would be the
wisest course, I do believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)'s got no home to go to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>After a little more consideration in the same strain, Mr. Gibson went
and sat down at the writing-table and wrote the following formula:--

<p/>_Master Coxe._

<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``That `master' will touch him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to the quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson to
himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wrote the word.-RRB-


<p/>Rx. Verecundiæ i oz.
Fidelitatis Domesticæ i oz.
Reticentiæ gr. iij.
M. Capiat hanc dosim ter die in aquâ purâ.

<p/>R. GIBSON, _Ch._


<p/>Mr. Gibson smiled a little sadly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) re-read his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) words. <div class="bookquote">``Poor
Jeanie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said aloud. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) chose out an envelope, enclosed
the fervid love-letter, and the above prescription; sealed it with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own sharply-cut seal-ring, R. G., in old English letters, and
then paused over the address.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'ll not like _Master Coxe_ outside; no need to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) to
unnecessary shame.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward</b></font>)</div>So the direction on the envelope was--

<p/>_Edward Coxe, Esq._

<p/>Then Mr. Gibson applied himself to the professional business which
had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) home so opportunely and unexpectedly, and afterwards
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went back through the garden to the stables; and just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said to the stable-man,--<div class="bookquote">``Oh! by the way,
here's a letter for Mr. Coxe. Don't send it through the women; take
it round yourself to the surgery-door, and do it at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The slight smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode out of the gates, died
away as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) found himself in the solitude of the lanes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
slackened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) speed, and began to think. It was very awkward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
considered, to have a motherless girl growing up into womanhood in
the same house with two young men, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only met them at
meal-times; and all the intercourse they had with each other was
merely the utterance of such words as, <div class="bookquote">``May I help you to potatoes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>or, as Mr. Wynne would persevere in saying, <div class="bookquote">``May I assist you to
potatoes?'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wynne</b></font>)</div>--a form of speech which grated daily more and more upon
Mr. Gibson's ears. Yet Mr. Coxe, the offender in this affair which
had just occurred, had to remain for three years more as a pupil in
Mr. Gibson's family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) should be the very last of the race. Still
there were three years to be got over; and if this stupid passionate
calf-love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lasted, what was to be done? Sooner or later Molly
would become aware of it. The contingencies of the affair were so
excessively disagreeable to contemplate, that Mr. Gibson determined
to dismiss the subject from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind by a good strong effort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) horse to a gallop, and found that the violent shaking over
the lanes--paved as they were with round stones, which had been
dislocated by the wear and tear of a hundred years--was the very best
thing for the spirits, if not for the bones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) made a long round
that afternoon, and came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) home imagining that the worst
was over, and that Mr. Coxe would have taken the hint conveyed in
the prescription. All that would be needed was to find a safe place
for the unfortunate Bethia, who had displayed such a daring aptitude
for intrigue. But Mr. Gibson reckoned without his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) host. It was the
habit of the young men to come in to tea with the family in the
dining-room, to swallow two cups, munch their bread or toast, and
then disappear. This night Mr. Gibson watched their countenances
furtively from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) long eye-lashes, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) tried against his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
wont to keep up a dégagé manner, and a brisk conversation on general
subjects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) saw that Mr. Wynne was on the point of breaking out
into laughter, and that red-haired, red-faced Mr. Coxe was redder
and fiercer than ever, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) whole aspect and ways betrayed
indignation and anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) will have it, will he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Gibson to himself; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
girded up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) loins for the battle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not follow Molly and Miss
Eyre into the drawing-room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usually did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) remained where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
was, pretending to read the newspaper, while Bethia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) face swelled
up with crying, and with an aggrieved and offended aspect, removed
the tea-things. Not five minutes after the room was cleared, came
the expected tap at the door. <div class="bookquote">``May I speak to you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>said the
invisible Mr. Coxe, from outside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. Come in, Mr. Coxe. I was rather wanting to talk to you
about that bill of Corbyn's. Pray sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is about nothing of that kind, sir, that I wanted--that I
wished--No, thank you--I would rather not sit down.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>), accordingly,
stood in offended dignity. <div class="bookquote">``It is about that letter, sir--that letter
with the insulting prescription, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Insulting prescription! I am surprised at such a word being applied
to any prescription of mine--though, to be sure, patients are
sometimes offended at being told the nature of their illnesses; and,
I daresay, they may take offence at the medicines which their cases
require.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not ask you to prescribe for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ho! Then you were the Master Coxe who sent the note through
Bethia! Let me tell you it has cost her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) place, and was a very
silly letter into the bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not the conduct of a gentleman, sir, to intercept it, and to
open it, and to read words never addressed to you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, with a slight twinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eye and a curl on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lips, not unnoticed by the indignant Mr. Coxe. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I was
once considered tolerably good-looking, and I daresay I was as great
a coxcomb as any one at twenty; but I don't think that even then I
should quite have believed that all those pretty compliments were
addressed to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not the conduct of a gentleman, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Coxe,
stammering over his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) words--he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was going on to say something more,
when Mr. Gibson broke in,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And let me tell you, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Gibson, with a sudden
sternness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``that what you have done is only excusable
in consideration of your youth and extreme ignorance of what are
considered the laws of domestic honour. I receive you into my house
as a member of my family--you induce one of my servants--corrupting
her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) with a bribe, I have no doubt--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir! I never gave her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) a penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you ought to have done. You should always pay those who do your
dirty work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now, sir, you called it corrupting with a bribe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>muttered Mr.
Coxe.

<p/>Mr. Gibson took no notice of this speech, but went on--<div class="bookquote">``Inducing one
of my servants to risk her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) place, without offering her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) the slightest
equivalent, by begging her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to convey a letter clandestinely to my
daughter--a mere child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Gibson, sir, is nearly seventeen! I heard you say so only the
other day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Coxe, aged twenty. Again Mr. Gibson ignored the
remark.

<p/>``A letter which you were unwilling to have seen by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) father, who
had tacitly trusted to your honour, by receiving you as an inmate of
his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) house. Your father's son--I know Major Coxe well--ought to have
come to me, and have said out openly, ``Mr. Gibson, I love--or I fancy
that I love--your daughter; I do not think it right to conceal this
from you, although unable to earn a penny; and with no prospect of an
unassisted livelihood, even for myself, for several years, I shall
not say a word about my feelings--or fancied feelings--to the very
young lady herself.<div class="bookquote">'' That is what your father's son ought to have
said; if, indeed, a couple of grains of reticent silence wouldn't
have been better still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I had said it, sir--perhaps I ought to have said it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Coxe, in a hurry of anxiety, <div class="bookquote">``what would have been your answer?
Would you have sanctioned my passion, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have said, most probably--I will not be certain of my exact
words in a suppositional case--that you were a young fool, but not
a dishonourable young fool, and I should have told you not to let
your thoughts run upon a calf-love until you had magnified it into
a passion. And I daresay, to make up for the mortification I should
have given you, I might have prescribed your joining the Hollingford
Cricket Club, and set you at liberty as often as I could on the
Saturday afternoons. As it is, I must write to your father's agent in
London, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to remove you out of my household, repaying the
premium, of course, which will enable you to start afresh in some
other doctor's surgery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will so grieve my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Coxe, startled into dismay,
if not repentance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see no other course open. It will give Major Coxe some trouble
-LRB-I shall take care that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) is at no extra expense-RRB-, but what I think
will grieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) the most is the betrayal of confidence; for I trusted
you, Edward, like a son of my own!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>There was something in Mr.
Gibson's voice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) spoke seriously, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) referred
to any feeling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) who so rarely betrayed what was passing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart--that was irresistible to most people: the change from
joking and sarcasm to tender gravity.

<p/>Mr. Coxe hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) head a little, and meditated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do love Miss Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>), at length. <div class="bookquote">``Who could help it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wynne, I hope!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Wynne</b></font>) heart is pre-engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Coxe. <div class="bookquote">``Mine was free as air
till I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it tend to cure your--well! passion, we'll say--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wore
blue spectacles at meal-times? I observe you dwell much on the beauty
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are ridiculing my feelings, Mr. Gibson. Do you forget that you
yourself were young once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Jeanie''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>rose before Mr. Gibson's eyes; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) felt a little
rebuked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Mr. Coxe, let us see if we can't make a bargain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>),
after a minute or so of silence. <div class="bookquote">``You have done a really wrong thing,
and I hope you are convinced of it in your heart, or that you will
be when the heat of this discussion is over, and you come to think a
little about it. But I won't lose all respect for your father's son.
If you will give me your word that, as long as you remain a member of
my family--pupil, apprentice, what you will--you won't again try to
disclose your passion--you see I am careful to take your view of what
I should call a mere fancy--by word or writing, looks or acts, in any
manner whatever, to my daughter, or to talk about your feelings to
any one else, you shall remain here. If you cannot give me your word,
I must follow out the course I named, and write to your father's
agent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Coxe stood irresolute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wynne knows all I feel for Miss Gibson, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wynne</b></font>) and I have no

of a Mr. Wynne, went to the reeds that grew on the shores of a
neighbouring lake, and whispered to them, ``King Midas has the ears of
an ass.<div class="bookquote">'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) repeated it so often that the reeds learnt the words,

that very reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ought to move among you all, as unharmed as Una
herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gibson, if you wish it, I'll swear it on the Bible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the
excitable young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense. As if your word, if it's worth anything, wasn't enough!
We'll shake hands upon it, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Coxe came forward eagerly, and almost squeezed Mr. Gibson's ring
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) finger.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was leaving the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said, a little uneasily, <div class="bookquote">``May I give
Bethia a crown-piece?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed! Leave Bethia to me. I hope you won't say another word to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Una</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Una</b></font>)'s here. I shall see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Una</b></font>) gets a respectable place
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Una</b></font>) goes away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Gibson rang for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) horse, and went out on the last visits
of the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) used to reckon that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode the world around in the
course of the year. There were not many surgeons in the county who
had so wide a range of practice as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went to lonely cottages on
the borders of great commons; to farm-houses at the end of narrow
country lanes that led to nowhere else, and were overshadowed by the
elms and beeches overhead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) attended all the gentry within a circle
of fifteen miles round Hollingford; and was the appointed doctor to
the still greater families who went up to London every February--as
the fashion then was--and returned to their acres in the early weeks
of July. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was, of necessity, a great deal from home, and on this
soft and pleasant summer evening he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) felt the absence as a great evil.
He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was startled at discovering that his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) little one was growing fast
into a woman, and already the passive object of some of the strong
interests that affect a woman's life; and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother as well as
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father--so much away that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not guard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would
have wished. The end of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cogitations was that ride to Hamley the
next morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) proposed to allow his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter to accept Mrs.
Hamley's last invitation--an invitation that had been declined at the
time.

<p/>``You may quote against me the proverb, ``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) that will not when he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
may, when he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shall have nay.<div class="bookquote">'' And I shall have no reason to
complain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said.

<p/>But Mrs. Hamley was only too much charmed with the prospect of having
a young girl for a visitor; one whom it would not be a trouble to
entertain; who might be sent out to ramble in the gardens, or told
to read when the invalid was too much fatigued for conversation; and
yet one whose youth and freshness would bring a charm, like a waft
of sweet summer air, into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) lonely shut-up life. Nothing could be
pleasanter, and so Molly's visit to Hamley was easily settled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wish Osborne and Roger had been at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) low soft voice. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) may find it dull, being with old people,
like the squire and me, from morning till night. When can she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) come?
the darling--I am beginning to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) already!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson was very glad in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart that the young men of the house
were out of the way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not want his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) little Molly to be passing
from Scylla to Charybdis; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) afterwards scoffed at himself
for thinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had got an idea that all young men were wolves in
chase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) one ewe-lamb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) knows nothing of the pleasure in store for her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) replied;
<div class="bookquote">``and I'm sure I don't know what feminine preparations she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) may think
necessary, or how long they may take. You'll remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) is a little
ignoramus, and has had no ... training in etiquette; our ways at
home are rather rough for a girl, I'm afraid. But I know I could not
send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into a kinder atmosphere than this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When the Squire heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife of Mr. Gibson's proposal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was
as much pleased as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at the prospect of their youthful visitor;
for he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was a man of a hearty hospitality, when his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) pride did not
interfere with its gratification; and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was delighted to think of
his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sick wife's having such an agreeable companion in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hours of
loneliness. After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``It's as well the lads are at
Cambridge; we might have been having a love-affair if they had been
at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--and if we had?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) more romantic wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``Osborne
will have had a first-rate education--as good as any man in the
county--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll have this property, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a Hamley of Hamley; not a
family in the shire is as old as we are, or settled on their ground
so well. Osborne may marry where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes. If Lord Hollingford had a
daughter, Osborne would have been as good a match as she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) could have
required. It would never do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) to fall in love with Gibson's
daughter--I shouldn't allow it. So it's as well he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>)'s out of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! perhaps Osborne had better look higher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps! I say he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) must.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div>The Squire brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hand down with a
thump on the table, near him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife's heart beat hard
for some minutes. <div class="bookquote">``And as for Roger,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) continued, unconscious of
the flutter he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) into, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll have to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own way,
and earn his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own bread; and, I'm afraid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s not getting on very
brilliantly at Cambridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mustn't think of falling in love for
these ten years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) marries a fortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley, more by way of
concealing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) palpitation than anything else; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was unworldly
and romantic to a fault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No son of mine shall ever marry a wife who is richer than himself
with my good will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire again, with emphasis, but without
a thump.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say but what if Roger is gaining five hundred a year by
the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s thirty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) shall not choose a wife with ten thousand
pounds down; but I do say, if a boy of mine, with only two hundred a
year--which is all Roger will have from us, and that not for a long
time--goes and marries a woman with fifty thousand to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) portion,
I'll disown him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)--it would be just disgusting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if they loved each other, and their whole happiness depended
upon their marrying each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>put in Mrs. Hamley, mildly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! away with love! Nay, my dear, we loved each other so dearly
we should never have been happy with any one else; but that's a
different thing. People aren't like what they were when we were
young. All the love nowadays is just silly fancy, and sentimental
romance, as far as I can see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had settled everything about Molly's going
to Hamley before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) about it, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not do, until
the morning of the day on which Mrs. Hamley expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
said,--<div class="bookquote">``By the way, Molly! you're to go to Hamley this afternoon;
Mrs. Hamley wants you to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) for a week or two, and it suits me
capitally that you should accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) invitation just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to Hamley! This afternoon! Papa, you've got some odd reason at
the back of your head--some mystery, or something. Please, tell me
what it is. Go to Hamley for a week or two! Why, I never was from
home before this without you in all my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. I don't think you ever walked before you put your feet
to the ground. Everything must have a beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has something to do with that letter that was directed to me, but
that you took out of my hands before I could even see the writing of
the direction.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) grey eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father's face, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) meant to pluck out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) secret.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) only smiled and said,--<div class="bookquote">``You're a witch, goosey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it had! But if it was a note from Mrs. Hamley, why might I
not see it? I have been wondering if you had some plan in your head
ever since that day.--Thursday, wasn't it? You've gone about in a
kind of thoughtful, perplexed way, just like a conspirator. Tell me,
papa'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), and putting on a beseeching manner--<div class="bookquote">``why
mightn't I see that note? and why am I to go to Hamley all on a
sudden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like to go? Would you rather not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had said that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) did not want to go he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would have been rather pleased than
otherwise, although it would have put him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) into a great perplexity;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was beginning to dread the parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) even for so short
a time. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) replied directly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I daresay I shall like it when I have thought a little
more about it. Just now I'm so startled by the suddenness of the
affair, I haven't considered whether I shall like it or not. I shan't
like going away from you, I know. Why am I to go, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are three old ladies sitting somewhere, and thinking about
you just at this very minute; one has a distaff in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hands, and is
spinning a thread; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has come to a knot in it, and is puzzled what
to do with it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sister has a great pair of scissors in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hands,
and wants--as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) always does, when any difficulty arises in the
smoothness of the thread--to cut it off short; but the third, who has
the most head of the three, plans how to undo the knot; and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) it is
who has decided that you are to go to Hamley. The others are quite
convinced by her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) arguments; so, as the Fates have decreed that this
visit is to be paid, there is nothing left for you and me but to
submit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all nonsense, papa, and you're only making me more curious to
find out this hidden reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) tone, and spoke gravely now. <div class="bookquote">``There is a
reason, Molly, and one which I do not wish to give. When I tell you
this much, I expect you to be an honourable girl, and to try and not
even conjecture what the reason may be,--much less endeavour to put
little discoveries together till very likely you may find out what I
want to conceal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I won't even think about your reason again. But then I shall
have to plague you with another question. I've had no new gown this
year, and I've outgrown all my last summer frocks. I've only three
that I can wear at all. Betty was saying only yesterday that I ought
to have some more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll do that you have got on, won't it? It's a very pretty
colour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but, papa''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-holding it out as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was going to dance-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``it's
made of woollen, and so hot and heavy; and every day it will be
getting warmer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish girls could dress like boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, with a little
impatience. <div class="bookquote">``How is a man to know when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter wants clothes?
and how is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to rig her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) out when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds it out, just when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
needs them most and hasn't got them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's the question!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in some despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you go to Miss Rose's? Doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) keep ready-made frocks for
girls of your age?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Rose! I never had anything from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>replied Molly,
in some surprise; for Miss Rose was the great dressmaker and milliner
of the little town, and hitherto Betty had made the girl's frocks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but it seems people consider you as a young woman now, and
so I suppose you must run up milliners' bills like the rest of your
kind. Not that you're to get anything anywhere that you can't pay for
down in ready money. Here's a ten-pound note; go to Miss Rose's, or
Miss anybody's, and get what you want at once. The Hamley carriage
is to come for you at two, and anything that isn't quite ready, can
easily be sent by their cart on Saturday, when some of their people
always come to market. Nay, don't thank me! I don't want to have the
money spent, and I don't want you to go and leave me: I shall miss
you, I know; it's only hard necessity that drives me to send you
a-visiting, and to throw away ten pounds on your clothes. There, go
away; you're a plague, and I mean to leave off loving you as fast as
I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) finger as in warning, <div class="bookquote">``you're getting
mysterious again; and though my honourableness is very strong, I
won't promise that it shall not yield to my curiosity if you go on
hinting at untold secrets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away and spend your ten pounds. What did I give it you for but to
keep you quiet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Rose's ready-made resources and Molly's taste combined, did not
arrive at a very great success. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bought a lilac print, because
it would wash, and would be cool and pleasant for the mornings; and
this Betty could make at home before Saturday. And for high-days and
holidays--by which was understood afternoons and Sundays--Miss Rose
persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) to order a gay-coloured flimsy plaid silk, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>)
assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was quite the latest fashion in London, and which Molly
thought would please her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's Scotch blood. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw the
scrap which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had brought home as a pattern, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried out that the
plaid belonged to no clan in existence, and that Molly ought to have
known this by instinct. It was too late to change it, however, for
Miss Rose had promised to cut the dress out as soon as Molly left her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
shop.

<p/>Mr. Gibson had hung about the town all the morning instead of going
away on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usual distant rides. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter once or twice
in the street, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not cross over when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was on the opposite
side--only gave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a look or a nod, and went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) way, scolding
himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) weakness in feeling so much pain at the thought of
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) absence for a fortnight or so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'm only where I was when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) comes
back; at least, if that foolish fellow goes on with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) imaginating
fancy. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll have to come back some time, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chooses to
imagine himself constant, there's still the devil to pay.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Presently
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) began to hum the air out of the <div class="bookquote">``Beggar's Opera'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>I wonder any man alive
Should ever rear a daughter.




<p/>CHAPTER VI.

<p/>A VISIT TO THE HAMLEYS.


<p/>Of course the news of Miss Gibson's approaching departure had spread
through the household before the one o'clock dinner-time came; and
Mr. Coxe's dismal countenance was a source of much inward irritation
to Mr. Gibson, who kept giving the youth sharp glances of savage
reproof for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) melancholy face, and want of appetite; which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
trotted out, with a good deal of sad ostentation; all of which was
lost upon Molly, who was too full of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own personal concerns to
have any thought or observation to spare from them, excepting once or
twice when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought of the many days that must pass over before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should again sit down to dinner with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) named this to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) after the meal was over, and they were
sitting together in the drawing-room, waiting for the sound of the
wheels of the Hamley carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laughed, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm coming over to-morrow to see Mrs. Hamley; and I daresay I shall
dine at their lunch; so you won't have to wait long before you've the
treat of seeing the wild beast feed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they heard the approaching carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, catching at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``I do so wish I wasn't
going, now that the time is come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense; don't let us have any sentiment. Have you got your keys?
that's more to the purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) keys, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) purse; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) little box was
put up on the seat by the coachman; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in;
the door was shut, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) drove away in solitary grandeur, looking
back and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, who stood at the gate, in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dislike of sentiment, as long as the carriage could
be seen. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned into the surgery, and found Mr. Coxe had
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) watching too, and had, indeed, remained at the window
gazing, moonstruck, at the empty road, up which the young lady had
disappeared. Mr. Gibson startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reverie by a sharp,
almost venomous, speech about some small neglect of duty a day or two
before. That night Mr. Gibson insisted on passing by the bedside of a
poor girl whose parents were worn-out by many wakeful anxious nights
succeeding to hard-working days.

<p/>Molly cried a little, but checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tears as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) remembered
how annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father would have been at the sight of them. It
was very pleasant driving quickly along in the luxurious carriage,
through the pretty green lanes, with dog-roses and honeysuckles so
plentiful and rathe in the hedges, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) once or twice was tempted
to ask the coachman to stop till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had gathered a nosegay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
began to dread the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) little journey of seven miles; the only
drawback to which was, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) silk was not a true clan-tartan, and
a little uncertainty as to Miss Rose's punctuality. At length they
came to a village; straggling cottages lined the road, an old church
stood on a kind of green, with the public-house close by it; there
was a great tree, with a bench all round the trunk, midway between
the church gates and the little inn. The wooden stocks were close to
the gates. Molly had long passed the limit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) rides, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew
this must be the village of Hamley, and that they must be very near
to the hall.

<p/>They swung in at the gates of the park in a few minutes, and drove up
through meadow-grass, ripening for hay,--it was no grand aristocratic
deer-park this--to the old red-brick hall; not three hundred yards
from the high-road. There had been no footman sent with the carriage,
but a respectable servant stood at the door, even before they drew
up, ready to receive the expected visitor, and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) into the
drawing-room where his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) mistress lay awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Hamley rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sofa to give Molly a gentle welcome; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
kept the girl's hand in hers after she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had finished speaking, looking
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) face, as if studying it, and unconscious of the faint blush
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) called up on the otherwise colourless cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we shall be great friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), at length. <div class="bookquote">``I like
your face, and I am always guided by first impressions. Give me a
kiss, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was far easier to be active than passive during this process of
<div class="bookquote">``swearing eternal friendship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>and Molly willingly kissed the sweet
pale face held up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant to have gone and fetched you myself; but the heat oppresses
me, and I did not feel up to the exertion. I hope you had a pleasant
drive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, with shy conciseness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I will take you to your room; I have had you put close to
me; I thought you would like it better, even though it was a smaller
room than the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) rose languidly, and wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) light shawl round her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) yet
elegant figure, led the way upstairs. Molly's bedroom opened
out of Mrs. Hamley's private sitting-room; on the other side of
which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) showed Molly this easy means of
communication, and then, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) visitor she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would await her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in
the sitting-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) closed the door, and Molly was left at leisure
to make acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) surroundings.

<p/>First of all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went to the window to see what was to be seen.
A flower-garden right below; a meadow of ripe grass just beyond,
changing colour in long sweeps, as the soft wind blew over it; great
old forest-trees a little on one side; and, beyond them again, to be
seen only by standing very close to the side of the window-sill, or
by putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head out, if the window was open, the silver shimmer
of a mere, about a quarter of a mile off. On the opposite side to the
trees and the mere, the look-out was bounded by the old walls and
high-peaked roofs of the extensive farm-buildings. The deliciousness
of the early summer silence was only broken by the song of the birds,
and the nearer hum of bees. Listening to these sounds, which enhanced
the exquisite sense of stillness, and puzzling out objects obscured
by distance or shadow, Molly forgot herself, and was suddenly
startled into a sense of the present by a sound of voices in the
next room--some servant or other speaking to Mrs. Hamley. Molly
hurried to unpack her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) box, and arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) few clothes in the
pretty old-fashioned chest of drawers, which was to serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
as dressing-table as well. All the furniture in the room was as
old-fashioned and as well-preserved as it could be. The chintz
curtains were Indian calico of the last century--the colours almost
washed out, but the stuff itself exquisitely clean. There was a
little strip of bedside carpeting, but the wooden flooring, thus
liberally displayed, was of finely-grained oak, so firmly joined,
plank to plank, that no grain of dust could make its way into the
interstices. There were none of the luxuries of modern days; no
writing-table, or sofa, or pier-glass. In one corner of the walls was
a bracket, holding an Indian jar filled with pot-pourri; and that and
the climbing honeysuckle outside the open window scented the room
more exquisitely than any toilette perfumes. Molly laid out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) white
gown -LRB-of last year's date and size-RRB- upon the bed, ready for the -LRB-to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) new-RRB- operation of dressing for dinner, and having arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
hair and dress, and taken out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) company worsted-work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) opened
the door softly, and saw Mrs. Hamley lying on the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we stay up here, my dear? I think it is pleasanter than
down below; and then I shall not have to come upstairs again at
dressing-time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall like it very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>replied Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you've got your sewing, like a good girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, I don't sew much. I live alone a great deal. You see, both
my boys are at Cambridge, and the squire is out of doors all day
long--so I have almost forgotten how to sew. I read a great deal. Do
you like reading?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It depends upon the kind of book,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I don't
like `steady reading,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>as papa calls it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you like poetry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley, almost interrupting Molly.
<div class="bookquote">``I was sure you did, from your face. Have you read this last poem of
Mrs. Hemans? Shall I read it aloud to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) began. Molly was not so much absorbed in listening but that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could glance round the room. The character of the furniture was
much the same as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own. Old-fashioned, of handsome material,
and faultlessly clean, the age and the foreign appearance of it gave
an aspect of comfort and picturesqueness to the whole apartment. On
the walls there hung some crayon sketches--portraits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could make out that one of them was a likeness of Mrs. Hamley,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) beautiful youth. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) became interested in the poem,
and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) work, and listened in a manner that was after Mrs.
Hamley's own heart. When the reading of the poem was ended, Mrs.
Hamley replied to some of Molly's words of admiration, by saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I think I must read you some of Osborne's poetry some day; under
seal of secrecy, remember; but I really fancy they are almost as good
as Mrs. Hemans'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>To be nearly as good as Mrs. Hemans' was saying as much to the young
ladies of that day, as saying that poetry is nearly as good as
Tennyson's would be in this. Molly looked up with eager interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Osborne Hamley? Does your son write poetry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I really think I may say he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is a poet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is a very brilliant,
clever young man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) quite hopes to get a fellowship at Trinity.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is sure to be high up among the wranglers, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) expects to get one of the Chancellor's medals. That is his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
likeness--the one hanging against the wall behind you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly turned round, and saw one of the crayon sketches--representing
two boys, in the most youthful kind of jackets and trousers, and
falling collars. The elder was sitting down, reading intently.
The younger was standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tennyson</b></font>), and evidently trying to call the
attention of the reader off to some object out of doors--out of
the window of the very room in which they were sitting, as Molly
discovered when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began to recognize the articles of furniture
faintly indicated in the picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like their faces!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is so long ago now,
that I may speak of their likenesses to you as if they were somebody
else; may not I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) understood what Molly
meant. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me just what you think of them, my dear; it will amuse
me to compare your impressions with what they really are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but I did not mean to guess at their characters. I could not do
it; and it would be impertinent, if I could. I can only speak about
their faces as I see them in the picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! tell me what you think of them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The eldest--the reading boy--is very beautiful; but I can't quite
make out his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face yet, because his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head is down, and I can't see the
eyes. That is the Mr. Osborne Hamley who writes poetry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is not quite so handsome now; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was a beautiful boy.
Roger was never to be compared with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is not handsome. And yet I like his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face. I can see his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes.
They are grave and solemn-looking; but all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face is
rather merry than otherwise. It looks too steady and sober, too good
a face, to go tempting his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but it was not a lesson. I remember the painter, Mr. Green, once
saw Osborne reading some poetry, while Roger was trying to persuade
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to come out and have a ride in the hay-cart--that was the
`motive' of the picture, to speak artistically. Roger is not much of
a reader; at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) doesn't care for poetry, and books of romance,
or sentiment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is so fond of natural history; and that takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),
like the squire, a great deal out of doors; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is
always reading scientific books that bear upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pursuits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is a
good, steady fellow, though, and gives us great satisfaction, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
is not likely to have such a brilliant career as Osborne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly tried to find out in the picture the characteristics of the
two boys, as they were now explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) by their mother; and in
questions and answers about the various drawings hung round the room
the time passed away until the dressing-bell rang for the six o'clock
dinner.

<p/>Molly was rather dismayed by the offers of the maid whom Mrs. Hamley
had sent to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid they expect me to be very
smart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) kept thinking to herself. <div class="bookquote">``If they do, they'll be
disappointed; that's all. But I wish my plaid silk gown had been
ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) looked at herself in the glass with some anxiety, for the first
time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) saw a slight, lean figure, promising to be
tall; a complexion browner than cream-coloured, although in a year or
two it might have that tint; plentiful curly black hair, tied up in a
bunch behind with a rose-coloured ribbon; long, almond-shaped, soft
gray eyes, shaded both above and below by curling black eyelashes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I am pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>thought Molly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) turned away from
the glass; <div class="bookquote">``and yet I'm not sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have been sure, if,
instead of inspecting herself with such solemnity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had smiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
own sweet merry smile, and called out the gleam of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) teeth, and the
charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dimples.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) way downstairs into the drawing-room in good time;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and learn how to feel at home in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
new quarters. The room was forty-feet long or so, fitted up with
yellow satin at some distant period; high spindle-legged chairs and
pembroke-tables abounded. The carpet was of the same date as the
curtains, and was thread-bare in many places; and in others was
covered with drugget. Stands of plants, great jars of flowers,
old Indian china and cabinets gave the room the pleasant aspect
it certainly had. And to add to it, there were five high, long
windows on one side of the room, all opening to the prettiest
bit of flower-garden in the grounds--or what was considered as
such--brilliant-coloured, geometrically-shaped beds, converging
to a sun-dial in the midst. The Squire came in abruptly, and in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) morning dress; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) stood at the door, as if surprised at the
white-robed stranger in possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hearth. Then, suddenly
remembering himself, but not before Molly had begun to feel very hot,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, God bless my soul, I'd quite forgotten you; you're Miss Gibson,
Gibson's daughter, aren't you? Come to pay us a visit? I'm sure I'm
very glad to see you, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time, they had met in the middle of the room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was
shaking Molly's hand with vehement friendliness, intended to make up
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) not knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go and dress, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) soiled
gaiters. <div class="bookquote">``Madam likes it. It's one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fine London ways, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s
broken me into it at last. Very good plan, though, and quite right
to make oneself fit for ladies' society. Does your father dress for
dinner, Miss Gibson?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not stay to wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) answer, but
hastened away to perform his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) toilette.

<p/>They dined at a small table in a great large room. There were so few
articles of furniture in it, and the apartment itself was so vast,
that Molly longed for the snugness of the home dining-room; nay,
it is to be feared that, before the stately dinner at Hamley Hall
came to an end, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) even regretted the crowded chairs and tables,
the hurry of eating, the quick unformal manner in which everybody
seemed to finish their meal as fast as possible, and to return to the
work they had left. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tried to think that at six o'clock all the
business of the day was ended, and that people might linger if they
chose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) measured the distance from the sideboard to the table with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eye, and made allowances for the men who had to carry things
backwards and forwards; but, all the same, this dinner appeared to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a wearisome business, prolonged because the Squire liked it, for
Mrs. Hamley seemed tired out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) ate even less than Molly, and sent
for fan and smelling-bottle to amuse herself with, until at length
the table-cloth was cleared away, and the dessert was put upon a
mahogany table, polished like a looking-glass.

<p/>The Squire had hitherto been too busy to talk, except about the
immediate concerns of the table, and one or two of the greatest
breaks to the usual monotony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) days; a monotony in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
delighted, but which sometimes became oppressive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife. Now,
however, peeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) orange, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) turned to Molly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow you'll have to do this for me, Miss Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I? I'll do it to-day, if you like, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; to-day I shall treat you as a visitor, with all proper ceremony.
To-morrow I shall send you errands, and call you by your Christian
name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wanting to call you something less formal than Miss Gibson,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Molly. It is an old-fashioned name, and I was christened
Mary. But papa likes Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right. Keep to the good old fashions, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must say I think Mary is prettier than Molly, and quite as
old a name, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) voice, and dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
eyes, <div class="bookquote">``because mamma was Mary, and I was called Molly while she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>said the squire, not perceiving his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) wife's signs
to change the subject, <div class="bookquote">``I remember how sorry every one was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
died; no one thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was delicate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had such a fresh colour,
till all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) popped off, as one may say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must have been a terrible blow to your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley,
seeing that Molly did not know what to answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay. It came so sudden, so soon after they were married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was nearly four years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And four years is soon--is a short time to a couple who look to
spending their lifetime together. Every one thought Gibson would have
married again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley, seeing in Molly's eyes and change of colour
how completely this was a new idea to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). But the squire was not so
easily stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I'd perhaps better not have said it, but it's the truth; they
did. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s not likely to marry now, so one may say it out. Why, your
father is past forty, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty-three. I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ever thought of marrying again,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, recurring to the idea, as one does to that of danger
which has passed by, without one's being aware of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did, my dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks to me just like a man
who would be constant to the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife. You must not mind
what the squire says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you'd better go away, if you're going to teach Miss Gibson such
treason as that against the master of the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly went into the drawing-room with Mrs. Hamley, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thoughts
did not change with the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not help dwelling on the
danger which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had escaped, and was astonished at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own stupidity at never having imagined such a possibility as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's second marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was answering Mrs.
Hamley's remarks in a very unsatisfactory manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is papa, with the Squire!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) suddenly exclaimed. There they
were coming across the flower-garden from the stable-yard, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father
switching his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) boots with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) riding whip, in order to make them
presentable in Mrs. Hamley's drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked so exactly like
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) usual self, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) home-self, that the seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the flesh was
the most efficacious way of dispelling the phantom fears of a second
wedding, which were beginning to harass his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's mind; and the
pleasant conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not rest till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had come over
to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was going on in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) new home, stole into her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heart,
although he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke but little to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and that little was all in a
joking tone. After he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had gone away, the Squire undertook to teach
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cribbage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was happy enough now to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) kept on prattling while they played; sometimes in
relation to the cards; at others telling her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) of small occurrences
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought might interest her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you don't know my boys, even by sight. I should have thought you
would have done, for they're fond enough of riding into Hollingford;
and I know Roger has often enough been to borrow books from your
father. Roger is a scientific sort of a fellow. Osborne is clever,
like his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother. I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) published a book some day.
You're not counting right, Miss Gibson. Why, I could cheat you as
easily as possible.''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>And so on, till the butler came in with a solemn
look, placed a large prayer-book before his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) master, who huddled the
cards away in a hurry, as if caught in an incongruous employment; and
then the maids and men trooped in to prayers--the windows were still
open, and the sounds of the solitary corncrake, and the owl hooting
in the trees, mingled with the words spoken. Then to bed; and so
ended the day.

<p/>Molly looked out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) chamber window--leaning on the sill, and
snuffing up the night odours of the honeysuckle. The soft velvet
darkness hid everything that was at any distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); although
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was as conscious of their presence as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had seen them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall be very happy here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>was in Molly's thoughts, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
turned away at length, and began to prepare for bed. Before long the
Squire's words, relating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's second marriage, came across
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and spoilt the sweet peace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) final thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``Who could he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
have married?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) asked herself. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Eyre? Miss Browning? Miss
Phoebe? Miss Goodenough?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>One by one, each of these was rejected
for sufficient reasons. Yet the unsatisfied question rankled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
mind, and darted out of ambush to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dreams.

<p/>Mrs. Hamley did not come down to breakfast; and Molly found out
with a little dismay, that the Squire and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were to have it by
themselves. On this first morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) put aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) newspapers--one
an old established Tory journal, with all the local and county
news, which was the most interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); the other the _Morning
Chronicle_, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) dose of bitters, and which called out
many a strong expression and tolerably pungent oath. To-day, however,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) manners,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) afterwards explained to Molly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
plunged about, trying to find ground for a conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could
talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sons, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) estate, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mode of farming;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tenants, and the mismanagement of the last county election.
Molly's interests were her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, Miss Eyre, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) garden and pony;
in a fainter degree Miss Brownings, the Cumnor Charity School, and
the new gown that was to come from Miss Rose's; into the midst of
which the one great question, <div class="bookquote">``Who was it that people thought it was
possible papa might marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>kept popping up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) mouth, like a
troublesome Jack-in-the-box. For the present, however, the lid was
snapped down upon the intruder as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) head between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) teeth. They were very polite to each other during the meal; and
it was not a little tiresome to both. When it was ended the Squire
withdrew into his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) study to read the untasted newspapers. It was
the custom to call the room in which Squire Hamley kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) coats,
boots, and gaiters, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) different sticks and favourite spud, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
gun and fishing-rods, <div class="bookquote">``the study.''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>There was a bureau in it, and a
three-cornered arm-chair, but no books were visible. The greater part
of them were kept in a large, musty-smelling room, in an unfrequented
part of the house; so unfrequented that the housemaid often neglected
to open the window-shutters, which looked into a part of the grounds
over-grown with the luxuriant growth of shrubs. Indeed, it was a
tradition in the servants' hall that, in the late squire's time--he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
who had been plucked at college--the library windows had been boarded
up to avoid paying the window-tax. And when the <div class="bookquote">``young gentlemen''
 (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>were at home the housemaid, without a single direction to that
effect, was regular in her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) charge of this room; opened the windows
and lighted fires daily, and dusted the handsomely-bound volumes,
which were really a very fair collection of the standard literature
in the middle of the last century. All the books that had been
purchased since that time were held in small book-cases between
each two of the drawing-room windows, and in Mrs. Hamley's own
sitting-room upstairs. Those in the drawing-room were quite enough to
employ Molly; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was so deep in one of Sir Walter Scott's
novels that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) jumped as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been shot, when an hour or so
after breakfast the Squire came to the gravel-path outside one of the
windows, and called to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would like to come out of doors
and go about the garden and home-fields with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be a little dull for you, my girl, all by yourself, with
nothing but books to look at, in the mornings here; but you see,
madam has a fancy for being quiet in the mornings: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told your
father about it, and so did I, but I felt sorry for you all the same,
when I saw you sitting on the ground all alone in the drawing-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had been in the very middle of the _Bride of Lammermoor_, and
would gladly have stayed in-doors to finish it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt the
squire's kindness all the same. They went in and out of old-fashioned
greenhouses, over trim lawns, the Squire unlocked the great walled
kitchen-garden, and went about giving directions to gardeners; and
all the time Molly followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) like a little dog, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind quite
full of <div class="bookquote">``Ravenswood''  (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Lucy Ashton.''  (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div>Presently, every place near
the house had been inspected and regulated, and the Squire was more
at liberty to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) companion, as they passed
through the little wood that separated the gardens from the adjoining
fields. Molly, too, plucked away her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thoughts from the seventeenth
century; and, somehow or other, that one question, which had so
haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) before, came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lips before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was aware--a
literal impromptu,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who did people think papa would marry? That time--long ago--soon
after mamma died?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) voice very soft and low, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke the last words.
The Squire turned round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) knew not
why. It was very grave, a little pale, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) steady eyes almost
commanded some kind of answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whew,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), whistling to gain time; not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had anything
definite to say, for no one had ever had any reason to join Mr.
Gibson's name with any known lady: it was only a loose conjecture
that had been hazarded on the probabilities--a young widower, with a
little girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard of any one--his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) name was never coupled with any
lady's--'twas only in the nature of things that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should marry
again; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) may do it yet, for aught I know, and I don't think it would
be a bad move either. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) so, the last time but one he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked breathless Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh: he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) only smiled and said nothing. You shouldn't take up words so
seriously, my dear. Very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) may never think of marrying again,
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did, it would be a very good thing both for him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and for
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly muttered something, as if to herself, but the Squire might have
heard it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had chosen. As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wisely turned the current of
the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said, as they suddenly came upon the mere, or
large pond. There was a small island in the middle of the glassy
water, on which grew tall trees, dark Scotch firs in the centre,
silvery shimmering willows close to the water's edge. <div class="bookquote">``We must get
you punted over there, some of these days. I'm not fond of using the
boat at this time of the year, because the young birds are still in
the nests among the reeds and water-plants; but we'll go. There are
coots and grebes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, look, there's a swan!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; there are two pair of them here. And in those trees there's
both a rookery and a heronry; the herons ought to be here by now, for
they're off to the sea in August, but I've not seen one yet. Stay!
isn't that one--that fellow on a stone, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) long neck bent down,
looking into the water?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I think so. I have never seen a heron, only pictures of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They and the rooks are always at war, which doesn't do for such near
neighbours. If both herons leave the nest they are building, the
rooks come and tear it to pieces; and once Roger showed me a long
straggling fellow of a heron, with a flight of rooks after him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), with
no friendly purpose in their minds, I'll be bound. Roger knows a deal
of natural history, and finds out queer things sometimes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d have
been off a dozen times during this walk of ours, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d been here:
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes are always wandering about, and see twenty things where I
only see one. Why! I've known him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) bolt into a copse because he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) saw
something fifteen yards off--some plant, maybe, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d tell me
was very rare, though I should say I'd seen its marrow at every turn
in the woods; and, if we came upon such a thing as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>touching
a delicate film of a cobweb upon a leaf with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) stick, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) spoke,
<div class="bookquote">``why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could tell you what insect or spider made it, and if it
lived in rotten fir-wood, or in a cranny of good sound timber, or
deep down in the ground, or up in the sky, or anywhere. It's a pity
they don't take honours in Natural History at Cambridge. Roger would
be safe enough if they did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Osborne Hamley is very clever, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly asked, timidly.

<p/>``Oh, yes. Osborne's a bit of a genius. His (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) mother looks for great
things from Osborne. I'm rather proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>)'ll get a
Trinity fellowship, if they play him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) fair. As I was saying at the
magistrates' meeting yesterday, ``I've got a son who will make a noise
at Cambridge, or I'm very much mistaken.<div class="bookquote">'' Now, isn't it a queer quip
of Nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>continued the squire, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) honest face towards
Molly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was going to impart a new idea to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I, a
Hamley of Hamley, straight in descent from nobody knows where--the
Heptarchy, they say--What's the date of the Heptarchy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, startled at being thus appealed to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! it was some time before King Alfred, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was the
King of all England, you know; but, as I was saying, here am I, of
as good and as old a descent as any man in England, and I doubt
if a stranger, to look at me, would take me for a gentleman, with
my red face, great hands and feet, and thick figure, fourteen
stone, and never less than twelve even when I was a young man; and
there's Osborne, who takes after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, who couldn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
great-grandfather from Adam, bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>); and Osborne has a girl's
delicate face, and a slight make, and hands and feet as small as a
lady's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) takes after madam's side, who, as I said, can't tell who
was her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) grandfather. Now, Roger is like me, a Hamley of Hamley, and
no one who sees him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in the street will ever think that red-brown,
big-boned, clumsy chap is of gentle blood. Yet all those Cumnor
people, you make such ado of in Hollingford, are mere muck of
yesterday. I was talking to madam the other day about Osborne's
marrying a daughter of Lord Hollingford's--that's to say, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had
a daughter--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>)'s only got boys, as it happens; but I'm not sure if
I should consent to it. I really am not sure; for you see Osborne
will have had a first-rate education, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) family dates from the
Heptarchy, while I should be glad to know where the Cumnor folk were
in the time of Queen Anne?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) walked on, pondering the question of
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) could have given his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) consent to this impossible marriage;
and after some time, and when Molly had quite forgotten the subject
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) alluded, he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) broke out with--<div class="bookquote">``No! I'm sure I should have
looked higher. So, perhaps, it's as well my Lord Hollingford has only
boys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After a while, he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) thanked Molly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) companionship, with
old-fashioned courtesy; and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) thought, by this time,
madam would be up and dressed, and glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) young visitor
with her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) pointed out the deep purple house, with its stone
facings, as it was seen at some distance between the trees, and
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) protectingly on her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) way along the field-paths.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a nice girl of Gibson's,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to himself. <div class="bookquote">``But what a
tight hold the wench got of the notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) marrying again! One had
need be on one's guard as to what one says before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). To think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) never having thought of the chance of a stepmother. To be sure, a
stepmother to a girl is a different thing to a second wife to a man!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VII.

<p/>FORESHADOWS OF LOVE PERILS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>If Squire Hamley had been unable to tell Molly who had ever been
thought of as her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's second wife, fate was all this time
preparing an answer of a pretty positive kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wondering
curiosity. But fate is a cunning hussy, and builds up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) plans as
imperceptibly as a bird builds her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) nest; and with much the same kind
of unconsidered trifles. The first <div class="bookquote">``trifle''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>of an event was the
disturbance which Jenny -LRB-Mr. Gibson's cook-RRB- chose to make at Bethia's
being dismissed. Bethia was a distant relation and protégée of
Jenny's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) chose to say it was Mr. Coxe the tempter who ought
to have <div class="bookquote">``been sent packing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tempter</b></font>)</div>not Bethia the tempted, the victim. In
this view there was quite enough plausibility to make Mr. Gibson
feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been rather unjust. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had, however, taken care to
provide Bethia with another situation, to the full as good as that
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) family. Jenny, nevertheless, chose to give
warning; and though Mr. Gibson knew full well from former experience
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) warnings were words, not deeds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hated the discomfort, the
uncertainty,--the entire disagreeableness of meeting a woman at any
time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) house, who wore a grievance and an injury upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face
as legibly as Jenny took care to do.

<p/>Down into the middle of this small domestic trouble came another, and
one of greater consequence. Miss Eyre had gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) old mother,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) orphan nephews and nieces, to the sea-side, during Molly's
absence, which was only intended at first to last for a fortnight.
After about ten days of this time had elapsed, Mr. Gibson received a
beautifully written, beautifully worded, admirably folded, and most
neatly sealed letter from Miss Eyre. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) eldest nephew had fallen ill
of scarlet fever, and there was every probability that the younger
children would be attacked by the same complaint. It was distressing
enough for poor Miss Eyre--this additional expense, this anxiety--the
long detention from home which the illness involved. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) said
not a word of any inconvenience to herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) only apologized with
humble sincerity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) inability to return at the appointed time
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) charge in Mr. Gibson's family; meekly adding, that perhaps it
was as well, for Molly had never had the scarlet fever, and even if
Miss Eyre had been able to leave the orphan children to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>)
employments, it might not have been a safe or a prudent step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, tearing the letter in two, and
throwing it into the hearth, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) soon saw it burnt to ashes. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish I'd a five-pound house and not a woman within ten miles of me. I
might have some peace then.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) forgot Mr. Coxe's powers
of making mischief; but indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might have traced that evil back
to the unconscious Molly. The martyr-cook's entrance to take away
the breakfast things, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) announced by a heavy sigh, roused Mr.
Gibson from thought to action.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly must stay a little longer at Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) resolved. <div class="bookquote">``They've
often asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and now they'll have enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), I think. But
I can't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) back here just yet; and so the best I can do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
is to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is. Mrs. Hamley seems very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), and
the child is looking happy, and stronger in health. I'll ride round
by Hamley to-day at any rate, and see how the land lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) found Mrs. Hamley lying on a sofa placed under the shadow of the
great cedar-tree on the lawn. Molly was flitting about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), gardening
away under her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) directions; tying up the long sea-green stalks of
bright budded carnations, snipping off dead roses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! here's papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cried out, joyfully, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode up to the
white paling which separated the trim lawn and trimmer flower-garden
from the rough park-like ground in front of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in--come here--through the drawing-room window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Hamley, raising herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) elbow. <div class="bookquote">``We've got a rose-tree to show
you that Molly has budded all by herself. We are both so proud of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>So Mr. Gibson rode round to the stables, left his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) horse there, and
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) way through the house to the open-air summer-parlour under
the cedar-tree, where there were chairs, table, books, and tangled
work. Somehow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rather disliked asking for Molly to prolong her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
visit; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) determined to swallow his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) bitter first, and then take
the pleasure of the delicious day, the sweet repose, the murmurous,
scented air. Molly stood by him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sate
opposite to Mrs. Hamley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come here to-day to ask a favour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Granted before you name it. Am not I a bold woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) smiled and bowed, but went straight on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Eyre, who has been Molly's governess, I suppose I must call
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)--for many years, writes to-day to say that one of the little
nephews she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to Newport while Molly was staying here,
has caught the scarlet fever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess your request. I make it before you do. I beg for dear little
Molly to stay on here. Of course Miss Eyre can't come back to you;
and of course Molly must stay here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; thank you very much. That was my request.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly's hand stole down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), and nestled in that firm compact
grasp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa!--Mrs. Hamley!--I know you'll both understand me--but mayn't I
go home? I am very happy here; but--oh papa! I think I should like to
be at home with you best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>An uncomfortable suspicion flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
round, and looked straight and piercingly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) innocent face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
colour came at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) unwonted scrutiny, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sweet eyes were filled
with wonder, rather than with any feeling which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) dreaded to find.
For an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had doubted whether young red-headed Mr. Coxe's
love might not have called out a response in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter's breast;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was quite clear now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, you're rude to begin with. I don't know how you're to make
your peace with Mrs. Hamley, I'm sure. And in the next place, do
you think you're wiser than I am; or that I don't want you at home,
if all other things were conformable? Stay where you are, and be
thankful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) well enough to be certain that the prolongation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
visit at Hamley was quite a decided affair in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was smitten with a sense of ingratitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, and
went to Mrs. Hamley, and bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) did
not speak. Mrs. Hamley took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) hand, and made room on the
sofa for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to have asked for a longer visit the next time you came,
Mr. Gibson. We are such happy friends, are not we, Molly? and now,
that this good little nephew of Miss Eyre's--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was whipped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--has given us such a capital reason, I shall keep Molly for a real
long visitation. You must come over and see us very often. There's a
room here for you always, you know; and I don't see why you should
not start on your rounds from Hamley every morning, just as well as
from Hollingford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. If you hadn't been so kind to my little girl, I might be
tempted to say something rude in answer to your last speech.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray say it. You won't be easy till you have given it out, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Hamley has found out from whom I get my rudeness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly,
triumphantly. <div class="bookquote">``It's an hereditary quality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to say that proposal of yours that I should sleep at
Hamley was just like a woman's idea--all kindness, and no common
sense. How in the world would my patients find me out, seven miles
from my accustomed place? They'd be sure to send for some other
doctor, and I should be ruined in a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't they send on here? A messenger costs very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy old Goody Henbury struggling up to my surgery, groaning at
every step, and then being told to just step on seven miles farther!
Or take the other end of society:--I don't think my Lady Cumnor's
smart groom would thank me for having to ride on to Hamley every time
his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) mistress wants me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, I submit. I am a woman. Molly, thou art a woman! Go and
order some strawberries and cream for this father of yours. Such
humble offices fall within the province of women. Strawberries and
cream are all kindness and no common sense, for they'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a
horrid fit of indigestion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please speak for yourself, Mrs. Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, merrily.
<div class="bookquote">``I ate--oh, such a great basketful yesterday, and the squire went
himself to the dairy and brought out a great bowl of cream, when he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
found me at my busy work. And I'm as well as ever I was, to-day, and
never had a touch of indigestion near me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s a good girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had danced out of
hearing. The words were not quite an inquiry, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so certain of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answer. There was a mixture of tenderness and trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) awaited the reply, which came in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s a darling. I cannot tell you how fond the Squire and I are of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>); both of us. I am so delighted to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) isn't to go away for
a long time. The first thing I thought of this morning when I wakened
up, was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) would soon have to return to you, unless I could
persuade you into leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) with me a little longer. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
must stay--oh, two months at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>It was quite true that the Squire had become very fond of Molly. The
charm of having a young girl dancing and singing inarticulate ditties
about the house and garden, was indescribable in its novelty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).
And then Molly was so willing and so wise; ready both to talk and to
listen at the right times. Mrs. Hamley was quite right in speaking
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) husband's fondness for Molly. But either she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) herself chose a
wrong time for telling him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of the prolongation of the girl's visit,
or one of the fits of temper to which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was liable, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
generally strove to check in the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>);
at any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) received the news in anything but a gracious frame of
mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay longer! Did Gibson ask for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I don't see what else is to become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); Miss Eyre away and
all. It's a very awkward position for a motherless girl like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to
be at the head of a household with two young men in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Gibson's look-out; he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should have thought of it before taking
pupils, or apprentices, or whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) calls them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Squire! why, I thought you'd be as glad as I was--as I am to
keep Molly. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to stay for an indefinite time; two months at
least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to be in the house with Osborne! Roger, too, will be at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>By the cloud in the Squire's eyes, Mrs. Hamley read his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)'s not at all the sort of girl young men of their age would
take to. We like her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) because we see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) really is; but lads of
one or two and twenty want all the accessories of a young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Want what?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>growled the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such things as becoming dress, style of manner. They would not at
their age even see that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is pretty; their ideas of beauty would
include colour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose all that's very clever; but I don't understand it. All I
know is, that it's a very dangerous thing to shut two young men of
one and three and twenty up in a country-house like this with a girl
of seventeen--choose what her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gowns may be like, or her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair, or her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
eyes. And I told you particularly I didn't want Osborne, or either of
them, indeed, to be falling in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>). I'm very much annoyed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hamley's face fell; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) became a little pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we make arrangements for their stopping away while she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) is
here; staying up at Cambridge, or reading with some one? going abroad
for a month or two?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you've been reckoning this ever so long on their coming home.
I've seen the marks of the weeks on your almanack. I'd sooner speak
to Gibson, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must take his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) daughter away, for it's not
convenient to us--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Roger! I beg you will do no such thing. It will be so
unkind; it will give the lie to all I said yesterday. Don't, please,
do that. For my sake, don't speak to Mr. Gibson!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, don't put yourself in a flutter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was afraid of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) becoming hysterical; <div class="bookquote">``I'll speak to Osborne when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) comes home,
and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) how much I should dislike anything of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Roger is always far too full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) natural history and
comparative anatomy, and messes of that sort, to be thinking of
falling in love with Venus herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has not the sentiment and
imagination of Osborne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you don't know; you never can be sure about a young man! But
with Roger it wouldn't so much signify. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would know he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) couldn't
marry for years to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>All that afternoon the Squire tried to steer clear of Molly, to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) felt himself to have been an inhospitable traitor. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was so
perfectly unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) shyness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and so merry and sweet
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) behaviour as a welcome guest, never distrusting him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) for a
moment, however gruff he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) might be, that by the next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
completely won him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) round, and they were quite on the old terms again.
At breakfast this very morning, a letter was passed from the Squire
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife, and back again, without a word as to its contents; but--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fortunate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! very!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Little did Molly apply these expressions to the piece of news Mrs.
Hamley told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) in the course of the day; namely, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) son
Osborne had received an invitation to stay with a friend in the
neighbourhood of Cambridge, and perhaps to make a tour on the
Continent with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) subsequently; and that, consequently, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not
accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brother when Roger came home.

<p/>Molly was very sympathetic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear! I am so sorry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hamley was thankful her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) husband was not present, Molly spoke the
words so heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been thinking so long of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) coming home. I am afraid it is
a great disappointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hamley smiled--relieved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! it is a disappointment certainly, but we must think of
Osborne's pleasure. And with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) poetical mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will write us such
delightful travelling letters. Poor fellow! he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) must be going into the
examination to-day! Both his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father and I feel sure, though, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
will be a high wrangler. Only--I should like to have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), my own
dear boy. But it is best as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was a little puzzled by this speech, but soon put it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
head. It was a disappointment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should not see
this beautiful, brilliant young man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's hero. From time to
time her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) maiden fancy had dwelt upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be like; how the
lovely boy of the picture in Mrs. Hamley's dressing-room would have
changed in the ten years that had elapsed since the likeness was
taken; if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would read poetry aloud; if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would even read his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own
poetry. However, in the never-ending feminine business of the day,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) soon forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own disappointment; it only came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) on
first wakening the next morning, as a vague something that was not
quite so pleasant as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had anticipated, and then was banished as a
subject of regret. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) days at Hamley were well filled up with the
small duties that would have belonged to a daughter of the house had
there been one. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) made breakfast for the lonely squire, and would
willingly have carried up madam's, but that daily piece of work
belonged to the squire, and was jealously guarded by him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) read
the smaller print of the newspapers aloud to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), city articles,
money and corn markets included. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) strolled about the gardens with
him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), gathering fresh flowers, meanwhile, to deck the drawing-room
against Mrs. Hamley should come down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) companion when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) drives in the close carriage; they read poetry and mild
literature together in Mrs. Hamley's sitting-room upstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was
quite clever at cribbage now, and could beat the squire if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) took
pains. Besides these things, there were her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own independent ways of
employing herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) used to try to practise an hour daily on
the old grand piano in the solitary drawing-room, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had
promised Miss Eyre she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) would do so. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) way into
the library, and used to undo the heavy bars of the shutters if the
housemaid had forgotten this duty, and mount the ladder, sitting on
the steps, for an hour at a time, deep in some book of the old
English classics. The summer days were very short to this happy girl
of seventeen.




<p/>CHAPTER VIII.

<p/>DRIFTING INTO DANGER.


<p/>On Thursday, the quiet country household was stirred through all
its fibres with the thought of Roger's coming home. Mrs. Hamley had
not seemed quite so well, or quite in such good spirits for two or
three days before; and the squire himself had appeared to be put out
without any visible cause. They had not chosen to tell Molly that
Osborne's name had only appeared very low down in the mathematical
tripos. So all that their visitor knew was that something was out of
tune, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hoped that Roger's coming home would set it to rights,
for it was beyond the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) small cares and wiles.

<p/>On Thursday, the housemaid apologized to her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) for some slight
negligence in her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) bedroom, by saying she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) had been busy scouring
Mr. Roger's rooms. <div class="bookquote">``Not but what they were as clean as could be
beforehand; but mistress would always have the young gentlemen's
rooms cleaned afresh before they came home. If it had been Mr.
Osborne, the whole house would have had to be done; but, to be sure,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was the eldest son, so it was but likely.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly was amused at
this testimony to the rights of heirship; but somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) herself had
fallen into the family manner of thinking that nothing was too great
or too good for <div class="bookquote">``the eldest son.''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father's eyes, Osborne was
the representative of the ancient house of Hamley of Hamley, the
future owner of the land which had been theirs for a thousand years.
His (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) mother clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) because they two were cast in the same
mould, both physically and mentally--because he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) bore her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) maiden name.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had indoctrinated Molly with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) faith, and, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
amusement at the housemaid's speech, the girl visitor would have
been as anxious as any one to show her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feudal loyalty to the heir,
if indeed it had been he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) that was coming. After luncheon, Mrs. Hamley
went to rest, in preparation for Roger's return; and Molly also
retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own room, feeling that it would be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to
remain there until dinner-time, and so to leave the father and mother
to receive their boy in privacy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took a book of MS. poems with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); they were all of Osborne Hamley's composition; and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother
had read some of them aloud to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) young visitor more than once.
Molly had asked permission to copy one or two of those which were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) greatest favourites; and this quiet summer afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took
this copying for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) employment, sitting at the pleasant open window,
and losing herself in dreamy out-looks into the gardens and woods,
quivering in the noon-tide heat. The house was so still, in its
silence it might have been the <div class="bookquote">``moated grange;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the booming buzz of
the blue flies, in the great staircase window, seemed the loudest
noise in-doors. And there was scarcely a sound out-of-doors but the
humming of bees, in the flower-beds below the window. Distant voices
from the far-away fields where they were making hay--the scent of
which came in sudden wafts distinct from that of the nearer roses
and honeysuckles--these merry piping voices just made Molly feel the
depth of the present silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had left off copying, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand
weary with the unusual exertion of so much writing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was
lazily trying to learn one or two of the poems off by heart.

<p/>I asked of the wind, but answer made it none,
Save its accustomed sad and solitary moan--

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) kept saying to herself, losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sense of whatever meaning the
words had ever had, in the repetition which had become mechanical.
Suddenly there was the snap of a shutting gate; wheels crackling on
the dry gravel, horses' feet on the drive; a loud cheerful voice
in the house, coming up through the open windows, the hall, the
passages, the staircase, with unwonted fulness and roundness of tone.
The entrance-hall downstairs was paved with diamonds of black and
white marble; the low wide staircase that went in short flights
around the hall, till you could look down upon the marble floor from
the top story of the house, was uncarpeted--uncovered. The Squire
was too proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) beautifully-joined oaken flooring to cover this
stair-case up unnecessarily; not to say a word of the usual state of
want of ready money to expend upon the decorations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) house. So,
through the undraperied hollow square of the hall and staircase every
sound ascended clear and distinct; and Molly heard the Squire's glad
<div class="bookquote">``Hallo! here he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire Hallo</b></font>)</div>and madam's softer, more plaintive voice; and
then the loud, full, strange tone, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew must be Roger's.
Then there was an opening and shutting of doors, and only a distant
buzz of talking. Molly began again--

<p/>I asked of the wind, but answer made it none.

<p/>And this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had nearly finished learning the poem, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
heard Mrs. Hamley come hastily into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sitting-room that adjoined
Molly's bedroom, and burst out into an irrepressible half-hysterical
fit of sobbing. Molly was too young to have any complication of
motives which should prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) going at once to try and give what
comfort she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could. In an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was kneeling at Mrs. Hamley's
feet, holding the poor lady's hands, kissing them, murmuring soft
words; which, all unmeaning as they were of aught but sympathy with
the untold grief, did Mrs. Hamley good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) checked herself, smiling
sadly at Molly through the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thick-coming sobs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only Osborne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), at last. <div class="bookquote">``Roger has been telling us
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew on Monday; we had a letter--he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not done so well
as we had hoped--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had hoped himself, poor fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had
just passed, but was only low down among the _junior optimes_, and
not where he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had expected, and had led us to expect. But the Squire
has never been at college, and does not understand college terms, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) has been asking Roger all about it, and Roger has been telling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and it has made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) so angry. But the squire hates college
slang;--he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) has never been there, you know; and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) thought poor
Osborne was taking it too lightly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) has been asking Roger about
it, and Roger--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a fresh fit of the sobbing crying. Molly burst out,--<div class="bookquote">``I
don't think Mr. Roger should have told; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had no need to begin so
soon about his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother's failure. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hasn't been in the house an
hour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush, love!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley. <div class="bookquote">``Roger is so good. You don't
understand. The squire would begin and ask questions before Roger had
tasted food--as soon as ever we had got into the dining-room. And all
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said--to me, at any rate--was that Osborne was nervous, and that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could only have gone in for the Chancellor's medals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) would
have carried all before him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>). But Roger said that after failing like
this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is not very likely to get a fellowship, which the Squire had
placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hopes on. Osborne himself seemed so sure of it, that the
squire can't understand it, and is seriously angry, and growing more
so the more he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) talks about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) has kept it in two or three days,
and that never suits him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) is always better when he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) is angry about
a thing at once, and doesn't let it smoulder in his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) mind. Poor, poor
Osborne! I did wish he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had been coming straight home, instead of
going to these friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>); I thought I could have comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>).
But now I'm glad, for it will be better to let his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) father's anger
cool first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>So talking out what was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) heart, Mrs. Hamley became more
composed; and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) dismissed Molly to dress for dinner, with
a kiss, saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a real blessing to mothers, child! You give one such pleasant
sympathy, both in one's gladness and in one's sorrow; in one's
pride -LRB-for I was so proud last week, so confident-RRB-, and in one's
disappointment. And now your being a fourth at dinner will keep
us off that sore subject; there are times when a stranger in the
household is a wonderful help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly thought over all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had heard, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was dressing
and putting on the terrible, over-smart plaid gown in honour of
the new arrival. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) unconscious fealty to Osborne was not in the
least shaken by his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) having come to grief at Cambridge. Only she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was
indignant--with or without reason--against Roger, who seemed to have
brought the reality of bad news as an offering of first-fruits on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
return home.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) went down into the drawing-room with anything but a welcome to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was standing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother; the Squire had not
yet made his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) appearance. Molly thought that the two were hand in hand
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) first opened the door, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not be quite sure. Mrs.
Hamley came a little forwards to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), and introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) in so
fondly intimate a way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) son, that Molly, innocent and simple,
knowing nothing but Hollingford manners, which were anything but
formal, half put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand to shake hands with one of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
heard so much--the son of such kind friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could only hope he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
had not seen the movement, for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) made no attempt to respond to it;
only bowed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was a tall powerfully-made young man, giving the impression
of strength more than elegance. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face was rather square,
ruddy-coloured -LRB-as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father had said-RRB-, hair and eyes brown--the
latter rather deep-set beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) thick eyebrows; and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had a trick
of wrinkling up his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyelids when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wanted particularly to observe
anything, which made his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes look even smaller still at such times.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had a large mouth, with excessively mobile lips; and another trick
of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was amused at anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) resisted the
impulse to laugh, by a droll manner of twitching and puckering up
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mouth, till at length the sense of humour had its way, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) features relaxed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) broke into a broad sunny smile; his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
beautiful teeth--his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) only beautiful feature--breaking out with a
white gleam upon the red-brown countenance. These two tricks of
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)--of crumpling up the eyelids, so as to concentrate the power
of sight, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) look stern and thoughtful; and the odd
twitching of the lips that was preliminary to a smile, which made
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) look intensely merry--gave the varying expressions of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face
a greater range <div class="bookquote">``from grave to gay, from lively to severe,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>than is
common with most men. To Molly, who was not finely discriminative
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) glances at the stranger this first night, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) simply appeared
<div class="bookquote">``heavy-looking, clumsy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``a person she (<font color='blue'><b>mothers</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mothers</b></font>) should never
get on with.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) certainly did not seem to care much what impression
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) made upon his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mother's visitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was at that age when young men
admire a formed beauty more than a face with any amount of future
capability of loveliness, and when they are morbidly conscious of the
difficulty of finding subjects of conversation in talking to girls
in a state of feminine hobbledehoyhood. Besides, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) thoughts were
full of other subjects, which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) did not intend to allow to ooze out
in words, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wanted to prevent any of that heavy silence which
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) feared might be impending--with an angry and displeased father,
and a timorous and distressed mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) only looked upon Molly as
a badly-dressed, and rather awkward girl, with black hair and an
intelligent face, who might help him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) in the task he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had set himself
of keeping up a bright general conversation during the rest of the
evening; might help him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought
him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) unfeeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) talkativeness; his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) constant flow of words upon
indifferent subjects was a wonder and a repulsion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). How could
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) go on so cheerfully while his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mother sat there, scarcely eating
anything, and doing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) best, with ill-success, to swallow down the
tears that would keep rising to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes; when his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) father's heavy
brow was deeply clouded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) evidently cared nothing--at first at
least--for all the chatter his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) son poured forth? Had Mr. Roger Hamley
no sympathy in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would show that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had some, at any rate. So
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) quite declined the part, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have taken,
of respondent, and possible questioner; and his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) work became more
and more like that of a man walking in a quagmire. Once the Squire
roused himself to speak to the butler; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) felt the need of outward
stimulus--of a better vintage than usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring up a bottle of the Burgundy with the yellow seal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) spoke low; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had no spirit to speak in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) usual voice. The
butler answered in the same tone. Molly sitting near them, and silent
herself, heard what they said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir, there are not above six bottles of that seal
left; and it is Mr. Osborne's favourite wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire turned round with a growl in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring up a bottle of the Burgundy with the yellow seal, as I said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The butler</b></font>)</div><p/>The butler went away wondering. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Osborne's''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>likes and dislikes
had been the law of the house in general until now. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had liked
any particular food or drink, any seat or place, any special degree
of warmth or coolness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wishes were to be attended to; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
was the heir, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was delicate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was the clever one of
the family. All the out-of-doors men would have said the same.
Mr. Osborne wished a tree cut down, or kept standing, or had
such-and-such a fancy about the game, or desired something unusual
about the horses; and they had all to attend to it as if it were
law. But to-day the Burgundy with the yellow seal was to be brought;
and it was brought. Molly testified with quiet vehemence of action;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) never took wine, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) need not have been afraid of the man's
pouring it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) glass; but as an open mark of fealty to the
absent Osborne, however little it might be understood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) placed the
palm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) small brown hand over the top of the glass, and held it
there, till the wine had gone round, and Roger and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father were in
full enjoyment of it.

<p/>After dinner, too, the gentlemen lingered long over their dessert,
and Molly heard them laughing; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw them loitering
about in the twilight out-of-doors; Roger hatless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
pockets, lounging by his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father's side, who was now able to talk in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) usual loud and cheerful way, forgetting Osborne. _Væ victis!_


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: VÆ VICTIS!-RSB-


<p/>And so in mute opposition on Molly's side, in polite indifference,
scarcely verging upon kindliness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), Roger and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) steered
clear of each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had many occupations in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) needed no
companionship, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been qualified to give it. The worst
was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was in the habit of occupying the library,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) favourite retreat, in the mornings before Mrs. Hamley came down.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) opened the half-closed door a day or two after his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) return home,
and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) busy among books and papers, with which the large
leather-covered table was strewn; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) softly withdrew before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
could turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), so as to distinguish her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) from one
of the housemaids. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) rode out every day, sometimes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father
about the outlying fields, sometimes far away for a good gallop.
Molly would have enjoyed accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) on these occasions, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was very fond of riding; and there had been some talk of sending
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) habit and grey pony when first she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came to Hamley; only the
Squire, after some consideration, had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) so rarely did more
than go slowly from one field to another, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) labourers were
at work, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) feared she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would find such slow work--ten minutes
riding through heavy land, twenty minutes sitting still on horseback,
listening to the directions he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) should have to give to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) men--rather
dull. Now, when if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pony here she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might have ridden
out with Roger, without giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) any trouble--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have taken
care of that--nobody seemed to think of renewing the proposal.

<p/>Altogether it was pleasanter before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came home.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father rode over pretty frequently; sometimes there were long
unaccountable absences, it was true; when his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter began to
fidget after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and to wonder what had become of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But when
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) appearance he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had always good reasons to give; and the
right she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) familiar household tenderness;
the power she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) possessed of fully understanding the exact value of
both his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) words and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) silence, made these glimpses of intercourse
with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) inexpressibly charming. Latterly her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) burden had always been,
<div class="bookquote">``When may I come home, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was unhappy, or
uncomfortable; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was passionately fond of Mrs. Hamley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was a
favourite of the Squire's, and could not as yet fully understand
why some people were so much afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); and as for Roger, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
did not add to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) pleasure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) scarcely took away from it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
wanted to be at home once more. The reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) could not tell;
but this she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) knew full well. Mr. Gibson reasoned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was weary of being completely convinced that it was right and
necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to stay where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was. And then with an effort she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
stopped the cry upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) tongue, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) saw that its repetition
harassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father.

<p/>During this absence of hers Mr. Gibson was drifting into matrimony.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was partly aware of whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was going; and partly it was
like the soft floating movement of a dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was more passive
than active in the affair; though, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reason had not fully
approved of the step he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was tending to--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had not believed that
a second marriage was the very best way of cutting the Gordian knot
of domestic difficulties, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could have made an effort without any
great trouble, and extricated himself without pain from the mesh
of circumstances. It happened in this manner:--Lady Cumnor having
married her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) two eldest daughters, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) labours as a chaperone to
Lady Harriet, the youngest, considerably lightened by co-operation;
and, at length, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had leisure to be an invalid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was, however,
too energetic to allow herself this indulgence constantly; only she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
permitted herself to break down occasionally after a long course of
dinners, late hours, and London atmosphere: and then, leaving Lady
Harriet with either Lady Cuxhaven or Lady Agnes Manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) betook
herself to the comparative quiet of the Towers, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) found
occupation in doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) benevolence, which was sadly neglected in
the hurly-burly of London. This particular summer she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had broken
down earlier than usual, and longed for the repose of the country.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) state of health, too, was more serious than
previously; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) did not say a word of this to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) husband or
daughters; reserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) confidence for Mr. Gibson's ears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
did not wish to take Lady Harriet away from the gaieties of town
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was thoroughly enjoying, by any complaint of hers, which
might, after all, be ill-founded; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not quite like
being without a companion in the three weeks or a month that might
intervene before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) family would join her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at the Towers, especially
as the annual festivity to the school visitors was impending; and
both the school and the visit of the ladies connected with it, had
rather lost the zest of novelty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thursday the 19th, Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, meditatively; <div class="bookquote">``what
do you say to coming down to the Towers on the 18th, and helping me
over that long day. You could stay in the country till Monday, and
have a few days' rest and good air; you would return a great deal
fresher to the remainder of your gaieties. Your father would bring
you down, I know: indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is coming naturally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, the youngest daughter of the
house--the prettiest, the most indulged; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot go; there's the
water-party up to Maidenhead on the 20th, I should be so sorry to
miss it: and Mrs. Duncan's ball, and Grisi's concert; please, don't
want me. Besides, I should do no good. I can't make provincial
small-talk; I'm not up in the local politics of Hollingford. I should
be making mischief, I know I should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, sighing, <div class="bookquote">``I had forgotten the
Maidenhead water-party, or I would not have asked you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity it isn't the Eton holidays, so that you could have had
Hollingford's boys to help you to do the honours, mamma. They are
such affable little prigs. It was the greatest fun to watch them last
year at Sir Edward's, doing the honours of their grandfather's house
to much such a collection of humble admirers as you get together at
the Towers. I shall never forget seeing Edgar gravely squiring about
an old lady in a portentous black bonnet, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) information
in the correctest grammar possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I like those lads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cuxhaven; <div class="bookquote">``they are on the way
to become true gentlemen. But, mamma, why shouldn't you have Clare to
stay with you? You like her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is just the person to save you
the troubles of hospitality to the Hollingford people, and we should
all be so much more comfortable if we knew you had her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Clare would do very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor; <div class="bookquote">``but isn't it her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
school-time or something? We must not interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) school so
as to injure her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), for I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is not doing too well as it is;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) has been so very unlucky ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) left us--first her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
husband died, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lost Lady Davies' situation, and then Mrs.
Maude's, and now Mr. Preston told your father it was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maude</b></font>) could
do to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Maude</b></font>) way in Ashcombe, though Lord Cumnor lets her (<font color='blue'><b>Maude</b></font>) have the
house rent-free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think how it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maude</b></font>)'s not very wise,
certainly; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maude</b></font>) is so useful and agreeable, and has such pleasant
manners, I should have thought any one who wasn't particular about
education would have been charmed to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Maude</b></font>) as a governess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by not being particular about education? Most
people who keep governesses for their children are supposed to be
particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cuxhaven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they think themselves so, I've no doubt; but I call you
particular, Mary, and I don't think mamma was; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought
herself so, I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think what you mean, Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, a good deal
annoyed at this speech of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) clever, heedless, youngest daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, mamma, you did everything you could think of for us; but
you see you'd ever so many other engrossing interests, and Mary
hardly ever allows her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband to interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
all-absorbing care for the children. You gave us the best of masters
in every department, and Clare to dragonize and keep us up to
our preparation for them, as well as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could; but then you
know, or rather you didn't know, some of the masters admired our
very pretty governess, and there was a kind of respectable veiled
flirtation going on, which never came to anything, to be sure; and
then you were often so overwhelmed with your business as a great
lady--fashionable and benevolent, and all that sort of thing--that
you used to call Clare away from us at the most critical times of
our lessons, to write your notes, or add up your accounts, and the
consequence is, that I'm about the most ill-informed girl in London.
Only Mary was so capitally trained by good awkward Miss Benson, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is always full to overflowing with accurate knowledge, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
glory is reflected upon me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think what Harriet says is true, Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Cumnor,
rather anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was so little with Clare in the school-room. I used to read French
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had a beautiful accent, I remember. Both Agnes and
Harriet were very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). I used to be jealous for Miss Benson's
sake, and perhaps--''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div>Lady Cuxhaven paused a minute--<div class="bookquote">``that made me
fancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) had a way of flattering and indulging them--not quite
conscientious, I used to think. But girls are severe judges, and
certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) had had an anxious enough lifetime. I am always so glad
when we can have her (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>), and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) a little pleasure. The only thing
that makes me uneasy now is the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) seems to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>)
daughter away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) so much; we never can persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Benson</b></font>) to bring
Cynthia with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) comes to see us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that I call ill-natured,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet; <div class="bookquote">``here is a poor
dear woman trying to earn her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) livelihood, first as a governess, and
what could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) do with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter then, but send her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to school? and
after that, when Clare is asked to go visiting, and is too modest
to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) girl with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)--besides all the expense of the journey,
and the rigging out--Mary finds fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) modesty and

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, after all, we are not discussing Clare and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) affairs, but
trying to plan for mamma's comfort. I don't see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) can do
better than ask Mrs. Kirkpatrick to come to the Towers--as soon as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) holidays begin, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) last letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, who had been searching
for it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) escritoire, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) daughters were talking. Holding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) glasses before her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) began to read, ''`My wonted
misfortunes appear to have followed me to Ashcombe'--um, um, um;
that's not it--``Mr. Preston is most kind in sending me fruit and
flowers from the Manor-house, according to dear Lord Cumnor's kind
injunction.'' Oh, here it is! ``The vacation begins on the 11th,
according to the usual custom of schools in Ashcombe; and I must
then try and obtain some change of air and scene, in order to fit
myself for the resumption of my duties on the 10th of August.<div class="bookquote">'' You
see, girls, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) would be at liberty, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) has not made any other
arrangement for spending her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) holidays. To-day is the 15th.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) at once, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>Lady Harriet said. <div class="bookquote">``Clare and I
are always great friends; I was her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) confidant in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) loves with poor
Mr. Kirkpatrick, and we've kept up our intimacy ever since. I know of
three offers she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had besides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sincerely hope Miss Bowes is not telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) love-affairs to Grace
or Lily. Why, Harriet, you could not have been older than Grace when
Clare was married!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cuxhaven, in maternal alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I was well versed in the tender passion, thanks to novels.
Now I daresay you don't admit novels into your school-room, Mary; so
your daughters wouldn't be able to administer discreet sympathy to
their governess in case she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was the heroine of a love-affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Harriet, don't let me hear you talking of love in that way;
it is not pretty. Love is a serious thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear mamma, your exhortations are just eighteen years too late.
I've talked all the freshness off love, and that's the reason I'm
tired of the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>This last speech referred to a recent refusal of Lady Harriet's,
which had displeased Lady Cumnor, and rather annoyed my lord; as
they, the parents, could see no objection to the gentleman in
question. Lady Cuxhaven did not want to have the subject brought up,
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) hastened to say,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do ask the poor little daughter to come with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother to the
Towers; why, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must be seventeen or more; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would really be a
companion to you, mamma, if her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother was unable to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not ten when Clare married, and I'm nearly nine-and-twenty,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>added Lady Harriet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of it, Harriet; at any rate you are but eight-and-twenty
now, and you look a great deal younger. There is no need to be always
bringing up your age on every possible occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was need of it now, though. I wanted to make out how old
Cynthia Kirkpatrick was. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) can't be far from eighteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) is at school at Boulogne, I know; and so I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) can
be as old as that. Clare says something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) in this letter:
``Under these circumstances' -LRB-the ill-success of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) school-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I
cannot think myself justified in allowing myself the pleasure of
having darling Cynthia at home for the holidays; especially as the
period when the vacation in French schools commences differs from
that common in England; and it might occasion some confusion in my
arrangements if darling Cynthia were to come to Ashcombe, and occupy
my time and thoughts so immediately before the commencement of my
scholastic duties as the 8th of August, on which day her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) vacation
begins, which is but two days before my holidays end.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Miss Clare</b></font>)</div>So, you see,
Clare would be quite at liberty to come to me, and I daresay it would
be a very nice change for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Hollingford is busy seeing after his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) new laboratory at the
Towers, and is constantly backwards and forwards. And Agnes wants to
go there for change of air, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) is strong enough after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) confinement. And even my own dear insatiable `me' will have had
enough of gaiety in two or three weeks, if this hot weather lasts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I may be able to come down for a few days too, if you will
let me, mamma; and I'll bring Grace, who is looking rather pale and
weedy; growing too fast, I'm afraid. So I hope you won't be dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, drawing herself up, <div class="bookquote">``I should be ashamed
of feeling dull with my resources; my duties to others and to
myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/>So the plan in its present shape was told to Lord Cumnor, who highly
approved of it; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) always did of every project of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wife's. Lady
Cumnor's character was perhaps a little too ponderous for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) in
reality, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was always full of admiration for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) words and
deeds, and used to boast of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wisdom, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) benevolence, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) power
and dignity, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) absence, as if by this means he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) could buttress up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own more feeble nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good--very good, indeed! Clare to join you at the Towers!
Capital! I couldn't have planned it better myself! I shall go down
with you on Wednesday in time for the jollification on Thursday. I
always enjoy that day; they are such nice, friendly people, those
good Hollingford ladies. Then I'll have a day with Sheepshanks, and
perhaps I may ride over to Ashcombe and see Preston--Brown Jess can
do it in a day, eighteen miles--to be sure! But there's back again to
the Towers!--how much is twice eighteen--thirty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty-six,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is; you're always right, my dear. Preston's a clever, sharp
fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) takes looking after; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s a sharp fellow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s such a
good-looking man, too, I wonder you don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never think whether a land-agent is handsome or not. They don't
belong to the class of people whose appearance I notice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure not. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) is a handsome fellow; and what should make
you like him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is the interest he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) takes in Clare and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) prospects. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
is constantly suggesting something that can be done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) house, and
I know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fruit, and flowers, and game just as regularly as
we should ourselves if we lived at Ashcombe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, with a faint suspicion of motives
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About twenty-seven, I think. Ah! I see what is in your ladyship's
head. No! no! he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s too young for that. You must look out for some
middle-aged man, if you want to get poor Clare married; Preston won't
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not a match-maker, as you might know. I never did it for my own
daughters. I'm not likely to do it for Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), leaning back
languidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! you might do a worse thing. I'm beginning to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'ll
never get on as a schoolmistress, though why she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) shouldn't, I'm sure
I don't know; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'s an uncommonly pretty woman for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) age, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) having lived in our family, and your having had her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) so often with
you, ought to go a good way. I say, my lady, what do you think of
Gibson? He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would be just the right age--widower--lives near the
Towers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you just now I was no match-maker, my lord. I suppose we had
better go by the old road--the people at those inns know us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div><p/>And so they passed on to speaking about other things than Mrs.
Kirkpatrick and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) prospects, scholastic or matrimonial.




<p/>CHAPTER IX.

<p/>THE WIDOWER AND THE WIDOW.


<p/>Mrs. Kirkpatrick was only too happy to accept Lady Cumnor's
invitation. It was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had been hoping for, but hardly daring to
expect, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) believed that the family were settled in London for
some time to come. The Towers was a pleasant and luxurious house in
which to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) holidays; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was not one to make deep
plans, or to look far ahead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was quite aware of the prestige
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) being able to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had been staying with <div class="bookquote">``dear Lady
Cumnor''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>at the Towers, was likely to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) school in
the eyes of a good many people; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) gladly prepared to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
ladyship on the 17th. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wardrobe did not require much arrangement;
if it had done, the poor lady would not have had much money to
appropriate to the purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very pretty and graceful; and
that goes a great way towards carrying off shabby clothes; and it was
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) taste more than any depth of feeling, that had made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) persevere
in wearing all the delicate tints--the violets and grays--which, with
a certain admixture of black, constitute half-mourning. This style of
becoming dress she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was supposed to wear in memory of Mr. Kirkpatrick;
in reality because it was both lady-like and economical. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
beautiful hair was of that rich auburn that hardly ever turns gray;
and partly out of consciousness of its beauty, and partly because the
washing of caps is expensive, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not wear anything on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head;
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) complexion had the vivid tints that often accompany the kind
of hair which has once been red; and the only injury her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) skin had
received from advancing years was that the colouring was rather more
brilliant than delicate, and varied less with every passing emotion.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could no longer blush; and at eighteen she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been very proud
of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blushes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes were soft, large, and china-blue in colour;
they had not much expression or shadow about them, which was perhaps
owing to the flaxen colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyelashes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) figure was a little
fuller than it used to be, but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) movements were as soft and sinuous
as ever. Altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked much younger than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) age, which
was not far short of forty. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a very pleasant voice, and read
aloud well and distinctly, which Lady Cumnor liked. Indeed, for some
inexplicable reason, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was a greater, more positive favourite with
Lady Cumnor than with any of the rest of the family, though they all
liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) up to a certain point, and found it agreeably useful to
have any one in the house who was so well acquainted with their ways
and habits; so ready to talk, when a little trickle of conversation
was required; so willing to listen, and to listen with tolerable
intelligence, if the subjects spoken about did not refer to serious
solid literature, or science, or politics, or social economy. About
novels and poetry, travels and gossip, personal details, or anecdotes
of any kind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) always made exactly the remarks which are expected
from an agreeable listener; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had sense enough to confine
herself to those short expressions of wonder, admiration, and
astonishment, which may mean anything, when more recondite things
were talked about.

<p/>It was a very pleasant change to a poor unsuccessful schoolmistress
to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own house, full of battered and shabby furniture -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
had taken the good-will and furniture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) predecessor at a
valuation, two or three years before-RRB-, where the look-out was as
gloomy, and the surrounding as squalid, as is often the case in the
smaller streets of a country town, and to come bowling through the
Towers Park in the luxurious carriage sent to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>); to alight,
and feel secure that the well-trained servants would see after her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
bags, and umbrella, and parasol, and cloak, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) loading
herself with all these portable articles, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had had to do
while following the wheelbarrow containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) luggage in going to
the Ashcombe coach-office that morning; to pass up the deep-piled
carpets of the broad shallow stairs into my lady's own room, cool and
deliciously fresh, even on this sultry day, and fragrant with great
bowls of freshly gathered roses of every shade of colour. There were
two or three new novels lying uncut on the table; the daily papers,
the magazines. Every chair was an easy-chair of some kind or other;
and all covered with French chintz that mimicked the real flowers in
the garden below. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was familiar with the bedroom called hers, to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was soon ushered by Lady Cumnor's maid. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
far more like home than the dingy place she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had left that morning;
it was so natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to like dainty draperies, and harmonious
colouring, and fine linen, and soft raiment. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sate down in the
arm-chair by the bed-side, and wondered over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fate something in
this fashion--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One would think it was an easy enough thing to deck a looking-glass
like that with muslin and pink ribbons; and yet how hard it is to
keep it up! People don't know how hard it is till they've tried as
I have. I made my own glass just as pretty when I first went to
Ashcombe; but the muslin got dirty, and the pink ribbons faded, and
it is so difficult to earn money to renew them; and when one has got
the money one hasn't the heart to spend it all at once. One thinks
and one thinks how one can get the most good out of it; and a new
gown, or a day's pleasure, or some hot-house fruit, or some piece of
elegance that can be seen and noticed in one's drawing-room, carries
the day, and good-by to prettily decked looking-glasses. Now here,
money is like the air they breathe. No one even asks or knows how
much the washing costs, or what pink ribbon is a yard. Ah! it would
be different if they had to earn every penny as I have! They would
have to calculate, like me, how to get the most pleasure out of it.
I wonder if I am to go on all my life toiling and moiling for money?
It's not natural. Marriage is the natural thing; then the husband
has all that kind of dirty work to do, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife sits in the
drawing-room like a lady. I did, when poor Kirkpatrick was alive.
Heigho! it's a sad thing to be a widow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there was the contrast between the dinners which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had to
share with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) scholars at Ashcombe--rounds of beef, legs of mutton,
great dishes of potatoes, and large batter-puddings, with the tiny
meal of exquisitely cooked delicacies, sent up on old Chelsea china,
that was served every day to the earl and countess and herself at
the Towers. She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) dreaded the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) holidays as much as the most
home-loving of her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) pupils. But at this time that end was some weeks
off, so Clare shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes to the future, and tried to relish the
present to its fullest extent. A disturbance to the pleasant, even
course of the summer days came in the indisposition of Lady Cumnor.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) husband had gone back to London, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and Mrs. Kirkpatrick had
been left to the very even tenor of life, which was according to my
lady's wish just now. In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) languor and fatigue, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
gone through the day when the school visitors came to the Towers, in
full dignity, dictating clearly all that was to be done, what walks
were to be taken, what hothouses to be seen, and when the party were
to return to the <div class="bookquote">``collation.''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) herself remained indoors, with
one or two ladies who had ventured to think that the fatigue or the
heat might be too much for them, and who had therefore declined
accompanying the ladies in charge of Mrs. Kirkpatrick, or those other
favoured few to whom Lord Cumnor was explaining the new buildings
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) farm-yard. <div class="bookquote">``With the utmost condescension,''  (<font color='red'><b>hearers</b></font>)</div>as her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) hearers
afterwards expressed it, Lady Cumnor told them all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) married
daughters' establishments, nurseries, plans for the education of
their children, and manner of passing the day. But the exertion tired
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>); and when every one had left, the probability is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) would
have gone to lie down and rest, had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) husband made an unlucky
remark in the kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) and put his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you're sadly tired, my lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) braced her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) muscles, and drew herself up, saying coldly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I am tired, Lord Cumnor, I will tell you so.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) fatigue
showed itself during the rest of the evening in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) sitting
particularly upright, and declining all offers of easy-chairs or
foot-stools, and refusing the insult of a suggestion that they
should all go to bed earlier. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) went on in something of this
kind of manner as long as Lord Cumnor remained at the Towers. Mrs.
Kirkpatrick was quite deceived by it, and kept assuring Lord Cumnor
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had never seen dear Lady Cumnor looking better, or so
strong. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had an affectionate heart, if a blundering head; and
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) could give no reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) belief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was almost certain
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wife was not well. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was too much afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to send for
Mr. Gibson without her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) permission. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) last words to Clare were--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's such a comfort to leave my lady to you; only don't you be
deluded by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ways. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll not show she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s ill till she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can't help
it. Consult with Bradley''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Miss Clare</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Lady Cumnor's <div class="bookquote">``own woman,'' (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) disliked
the new-fangledness of <div class="bookquote">``lady's-maid'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``and if I were you, I'd send
and ask Gibson to call--you might make any kind of a pretence,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and
then the idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had had in London of the fitness of a match
between the two coming into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head just now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could not help
adding,--<div class="bookquote">``Get him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to come and see you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s a very agreeable man;
Lord Hollingford says there's no one like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) in these parts: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>)
might be looking at my lady while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) was talking to you, and see if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) really ill. And let me know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) says about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Clare was just as great a coward about doing anything for Lady
Cumnor which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had not expressly ordered, as Lord Cumnor himself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) might fall into such disgrace if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sent for Mr. Gibson
without direct permission, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) might never be asked to stay at
the Towers again; and the life there, monotonous in its smoothness of
luxury as it might be to some, was exactly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) taste. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
turn tried to put upon Bradley the duty which Lord Cumnor had put
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bradley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) said one day, <div class="bookquote">``are you quite comfortable about
my lady's health? Lord Cumnor fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was looking worn and
ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Mrs. Kirkpatrick, I don't think my lady is herself. I can't
persuade myself as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is, though if you was to question me till
night I couldn't tell you why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think you could make some errand to Hollingford, and see
Mr. Gibson, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to come round this way some day, and make a
call on Lady Cumnor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be as much as my place is worth, Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Till my
lady's dying day, if Providence keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) senses, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll have
everything done her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own way, or not at all. There's only Lady Harriet
that can manage her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) the least, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) not always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then--we must hope that there is nothing the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>);
and I daresay there is not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) says there is not, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought to
know best herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/>But a day or two after this conversation took place, Lady Cumnor
startled Mrs. Kirkpatrick, by saying suddenly,--<div class="bookquote">``Clare, I wish you'd
write a note to Mr. Gibson, saying I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) this
afternoon. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would have called of himself before now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
ought to have done so, to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) respects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson had been far too busy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) profession to have time for
mere visits of ceremony, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew quite well he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was neglecting
what was expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). But the district of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) may be said to
have had medical charge was full of a bad kind of low fever, which
took up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) time and thought, and often made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) very thankful
that Molly was out of the way in the quiet shades of Hamley.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) domestic <div class="bookquote">``rows''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had not healed over in the least, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
was obliged to put the perplexities on one side for the time. The
last drop--the final straw, had been an impromptu visit of Lord
Hollingford's, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had met in the town one forenoon. They had had
a good deal to say to each other about some new scientific discovery,
with the details of which Lord Hollingford was well acquainted,
while Mr. Gibson was ignorant and deeply interested. At length Lord
Hollingford said suddenly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gibson, I wonder if you'd give me some lunch; I've been a good
deal about since my seven-o'clock breakfast, and am getting quite
ravenous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Hollingford/Hollingford</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Mr. Gibson was only too much pleased to show hospitality to one
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) liked and respected so much as Lord Hollingford, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>)
gladly took him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) to the early family dinner. But it was
just at the time when the cook was sulking at Bethia's dismissal--and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) chose to be unpunctual and careless. There was no successor to
Bethia as yet appointed to wait at the meals. So, though Mr. Gibson
knew well that bread-and-cheese, cold beef, or the simplest food
available, would have been welcome to the hungry lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) could not
get either these things for luncheon, or even the family dinner, at
anything like the proper time, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) ringing, and as
much anger as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) liked to show, for fear of making Lord Hollingford
uncomfortable. At last dinner was ready, but the poor host saw
the want of nicety--almost the want of cleanliness, in all its
accompaniments--dingy plate, dull-looking glass, a table-cloth that,
if not absolutely dirty, was anything but fresh in its splashed and
rumpled condition, and compared it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) own mind with the dainty
delicacy with which even a loaf of brown bread was served up at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) guest's home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) did not apologize directly, but, after dinner,
just as they were parting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``You see a man like me--a
widower--with a daughter who cannot always be at home--has not the
regulated household which would enable me to command the small
portions of time I can spend there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) made no allusion to the comfortless meal of which they had both
partaken, though it was full in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) mind. Nor was it absent from Lord
Hollingford's as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) made reply,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True, true. Yet a man like you ought to be free from any thought of
household cares. You ought to have somebody. How old is Miss Gibson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seventeen. It's a very awkward age for a motherless girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; very. I have only boys, but it must be very awkward with
a girl. Excuse me, Gibson, but we're talking like friends. Have
you never thought of marrying again? It wouldn't be like a first
marriage, of course; but if you found a sensible, agreeable woman of
thirty or so, I really think you couldn't do better than take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to
manage your home, and so save you either discomfort or worry; and,
besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be able to give your daughter that kind of tender
supervision which, I fancy, all girls of that age require. It's a
delicate subject, but you'll excuse my having spoken frankly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson had thought of this advice several times since it was
given; but it was a case of <div class="bookquote">``first catch your hare.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Where was the
<div class="bookquote">``sensible and agreeable woman of thirty or so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>Not Miss Browning,
nor Miss Phoebe, nor Miss Goodenough. Among his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) country patients
there were two classes pretty distinctly marked: farmers, whose
children were unrefined and uneducated; squires, whose daughters
would, indeed, think the world was coming to a pretty pass, if they
were to marry a country surgeon.

<p/>But the first day on which Mr. Gibson paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) visit to Lady Cumnor,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) began to think it possible that Mrs. Kirkpatrick was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``hare.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode away with slack rein, thinking over what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>),
more than about the prescriptions he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) should write, or the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
going. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) as a very pretty Miss Clare: the governess
who had the scarlet fever; that was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife's days, a long time
ago; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could hardly understand Mrs. Kirkpatrick's youthfulness
of appearance when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought how long. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
marriage to a curate; and the next day -LRB-or so it seemed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could not
recollect the exact duration of the interval-RRB-, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew,
in some way, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had been living ever since as a governess in
different families; but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had always been a great favourite
with the family at the Towers, for whom, quite independent of their
rank, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had a true respect. A year or two ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
had taken the good-will of a school at Ashcombe; a small town close
to another property of Lord Cumnor's, in the same county. Ashcombe
was a larger estate than that near Hollingford, but the old
Manor-house there was not nearly so good a residence as the Towers;
so it was given up to Mr. Preston, the land-agent for the Ashcombe
property, just as Mr. Sheepshanks was for that at Hollingford.
There were a few rooms at the Manor-house reserved for the
occasional visits of the family, otherwise Mr. Preston, a handsome
young bachelor, had it all to himself. Mr. Gibson knew that Mrs.
Kirkpatrick had one child, a daughter, who must be much about the
same age as Molly. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had very little, if any, property.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) himself had lived carefully, and had a few thousands well
invested; besides which, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) professional income was good, and
increasing rather than diminishing every year. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
arrived at this point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) consideration of the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was at the
house of the next patient on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) round, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) put away all thought
of matrimony and Mrs. Kirkpatrick for the time. Once again, in the
course of the day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) remembered with a certain pleasure that Molly
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) some little details connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) unlucky detention
at the Towers five or six years ago, which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) feel at the
time as if Mrs. Kirkpatrick had behaved very kindly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) little
girl. So there the matter rested for the present, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
concerned.

<p/>Lady Cumnor was out of health; but not so ill as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had been
fancying herself during all those days when the people about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
dared not send for the doctor. It was a great relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) to have
Mr. Gibson to decide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was to do; what to eat, drink,
avoid. Such decisions _ab extra_, are sometimes a wonderful relief
to those whose habit it has been to decide, not only for themselves,
but for every one else; and occasionally the relaxation of the strain
which a character for infallible wisdom brings with it, does much to
restore health. Mrs. Kirkpatrick thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) secret soul that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
had never found it so easy to get on with Lady Cumnor; and Bradley
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) had never done singing the praises of Mr. Gibson, <div class="bookquote">``who always
managed my lady so beautifully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Reports were duly sent up to my lord, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) daughters were
strictly forbidden to come down. Lady Cumnor wished to be weak
and languid, and uncertain both in body and mind, without family
observation. It was a condition so different to anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had
ever been in before, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was unconsciously afraid of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
prestige, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was seen in it. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) herself wrote the
daily bulletins; at other times she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) bade Clare do it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would
always see the letters. Any answers she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) daughters
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) used to read herself, occasionally imparting some of their
contents to <div class="bookquote">``that good Clare.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But anybody might read my lord's
letters. There was no great fear of family secrets oozing out in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
sprawling lines of affection. But once Mrs. Kirkpatrick came upon a
sentence in a letter from Lord Cumnor, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was reading out loud
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wife, that caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) eye before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) came to it, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
could have skipped it and kept it for private perusal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) would
gladly have done so. My lady was too sharp for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), though. In her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
opinion <div class="bookquote">``Clare was a good creature, but not clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the truth
being that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not always quick at resources, though tolerably
unscrupulous in the use of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read on. What are you stopping for? There is no bad news, is there,
about Agnes?--Give me the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Cumnor read, half aloud,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`How are Clare and Gibson getting on? You despised my advice to help
on that affair, but I really think a little match-making would be a
very pleasant amusement now that you are shut up in the house; and I
cannot conceive any marriage more suitable.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``it was awkward for you to come
upon that, Clare: I don't wonder you stopped short. You gave me a
terrible fright, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Cumnor is so fond of joking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Kirkpatrick, a little
flurried, yet quite recognizing the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) last words,--<div class="bookquote">``I
cannot conceive any marriage more suitable.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) wondered what Lady
Cumnor thought of it. Lord Cumnor wrote as if there was really a
chance. It was not an unpleasant idea; it brought a faint smile out
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) sat by Lady Cumnor, while the latter took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
afternoon nap.




<p/>CHAPTER X.

<p/>A CRISIS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>Mrs. Kirkpatrick had been reading aloud till Lady Cumnor fell asleep,
the book rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) knee, just kept from falling by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) hold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
was looking out of the window, not seeing the trees in the park, nor
the glimpses of the hills beyond, but thinking how pleasant it would
be to have a husband once more;--some one who would work while she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
sate at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) elegant ease in a prettily-furnished drawing-room; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was rapidly investing this imaginary breadwinner with the form
and features of the country surgeon, when there was a slight tap
at the door, and almost before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) could rise, the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
thoughts came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) felt herself blush, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was not displeased
at the consciousness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) advanced to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), making a sign towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) sleeping ladyship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), in a low voice, casting a professional eye on
the slumbering figure; <div class="bookquote">``can I speak to you for a minute or two in the
library?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) going to offer?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), with a sudden palpitation, and
a conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) willingness to accept a man whom an hour before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had simply looked upon as one of the category of unmarried men to
whom matrimony was possible.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was only going to make one or two medical inquiries; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) found
that out very speedily, and considered the conversation as rather
flat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), though it might be instructive to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was not aware
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finally made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to propose, during the time that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was speaking--answering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) questions in many words, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
accustomed to winnow the chaff from the corn; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) voice was so
soft, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) accent so pleasant, that it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as particularly
agreeable after the broad country accent he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was perpetually hearing.
Then the harmonious colours of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) dress, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) slow and graceful
movements, had something of the same soothing effect upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nerves
that a cat's purring has upon some people's. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to think
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be fortunate if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could win her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own sake.
Yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) more as a possible stepmother
for Molly; to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) as a wife for himself.
The remembrance of Lord Cumnor's letter gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) a very becoming
consciousness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wished to attract, and hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was
succeeding. Still they only talked of the countess's state for some
time: then a lucky shower came on. Mr. Gibson did not care a jot for
rain, but just now it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) an excuse for lingering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very stormy weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very. My daughter writes me word, that for two days last week
the packet could not sail from Boulogne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Kirkpatrick is at Boulogne, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, poor girl; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is at school there, trying to perfect herself
in the French language. But, Mr. Gibson, you must not call her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Miss
Kirkpatrick. Cynthia remembers you with so much--affection, I may
say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was your little patient when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had the measles here four
years ago, you know. Pray call her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) Cynthia; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would be quite hurt
at such a formal name as Miss Kirkpatrick from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia seems to me such an out-of-the-way name, only fit for
poetry, not for daily use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Kirkpatrick, in a plaintive tone of reproach.
<div class="bookquote">``I was christened Hyacinth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) poor father would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) called
after me. I'm sorry you don't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson did not know what to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not quite prepared to
plunge into the directly personal style. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was hesitating, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hyacinth Clare! Once upon a time I was quite proud of my pretty
name; and other people thought it pretty, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no doubt--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gibson began; and then stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I did wrong in yielding to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wish, to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) called by
such a romantic name. It may excite prejudice against her (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) in some
people; and, poor child! she (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) will have enough to struggle with. A
young daughter is a great charge, Mr. Gibson, especially when there
is only one parent to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), recalled to the remembrance of Molly;
<div class="bookquote">``though I should have thought that a girl who is so fortunate as to
have a mother could not feel the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father so acutely as one
who is motherless must suffer from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) deprivation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are thinking of your own daughter. It was careless of me to say
what I did. Dear child! how well I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sweet little face as
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay sleeping on my bed. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is nearly grown-up now. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
must be near my Cynthia's age. How I should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will. I should like you to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). I should like you to
love my poor little Molly,--to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as your own--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) swallowed
down something that rose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) throat, and was nearly choking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) going to offer? _Is_ he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wondered; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began to
tremble in the suspense before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) next spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you love her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as your daughter? Will you try? Will you give
me the right of introducing you to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) future mother; as my
wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There! he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had done it--whether it was wise or foolish--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had done
it! but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was aware that the question as to its wisdom came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
mind the instant that the words were said past recall.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said; and then, a little to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) surprise, and a
great deal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) burst into hysterical tears: it was such
a wonderful relief to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) need not struggle any more for a
livelihood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear--my dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), trying to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with word and
caress; but, just at the moment, uncertain what name he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ought to
use. After her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sobbing had abated a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said herself, as if
understanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) difficulty,--

<p/>``Call me Hyacinth--your own Hyacinth. I can't bear ``Clare,<div class="bookquote">'' it does
so remind me of being a governess, and those days are all past now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but surely no one can have been more valued, more beloved than
you have been in this family at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! they have been very good. But still one has always had to
remember one's position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We ought to tell Lady Cumnor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), thinking, perhaps, more of
the various duties which lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in consequence of the step he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
had just taken, than of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) future bride was saying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face with
beseeching eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I always like other people to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) things, and
then I can see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) takes them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly! I will do whatever you wish. Shall we go and see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
is awake now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I think not. I had better prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>). You will come to-morrow,
won't you? and you will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that will be best. I ought to tell Molly first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has the
right to know. I do hope you and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) will love each other dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! I'm sure we shall. Then you'll come to-morrow and tell Lady
Cumnor? And I'll prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what preparation is necessary; but you know best, my
dear. When can we arrange for you and Molly to meet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div><p/>Just then a servant came in, and the pair started apart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ladyship is awake, and wishes to see Mr. Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>They both followed the man upstairs; Mrs. Kirkpatrick trying hard
to look as if nothing had happened, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) particularly wished
<div class="bookquote">``to prepare''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Lady Cumnor; that is to say, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) version of Mr.
Gibson's extreme urgency, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) own coy unwillingness.

<p/>But Lady Cumnor had observant eyes in sickness as well as in health.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had gone to sleep with the recollection of the passage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
husband's letter full in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) mind, and, perhaps, it gave a direction
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wakening ideas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you're not gone, Mr. Gibson. I wanted to tell you-- What's
the matter with you both? What have you been saying to Clare? I'm
sure something has happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing for it, in Mr. Gibson's opinion, but to make a
clean breast of it, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) ladyship all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) turned round, and
took hold of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's hand, and said out straight, <div class="bookquote">``I have
been asking Mrs. Kirkpatrick to be my wife, and to be a mother to my
child; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has consented. I hardly know how to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) enough
in words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Umph! I don't see any objection. I daresay you'll be very happy.
I'm very glad of it! Here! shake hands with me, both of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then
laughing a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``It does not seem to me that any
exertion has been required on my part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson looked perplexed at these words. Mrs. Kirkpatrick
reddened.

<p/>``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not tell you? Oh, then, I must. It's too good a joke to be
lost, especially as everything has ended so well. When Lord Cumnor's
letter came this morning--this very morning--I gave it to Clare to
read aloud to me, and I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) suddenly came to a full stop, where
no full stop could be, and I thought it was something about Agnes,
so I took the letter and read--stay! I'll read the sentence to you.
Where's the letter, Clare? Oh! don't trouble yourself, here it is.
``How are Clare and Gibson getting on? You despised my advice to help
on that affair, but I really think a little match-making would be a
very pleasant amusement, now that you are shut up in the house; and
I cannot conceive any marriage more suitable.<div class="bookquote">'' You see, you have my
lord's full approbation. But I must write, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) you have
managed your own affairs without any interference of mine. Now we'll
just have a little medical talk, Mr. Gibson, and then you and Clare
shall finish your tête-à-tête.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>They were neither of them quite as desirous of further conversation
together as they had been before the passage out of Lord Cumnor's
letter had been read aloud. Mr. Gibson tried not to think about it,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was aware that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) dwelt upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might get to fancy all
sorts of things, as to the conversation which had ended in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) offer.
But Lady Cumnor was imperious now, as always.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, no nonsense. I always made my girls go and have tête-à-têtes
with the men who were to be their husbands, whether they would or no:
there's a great deal to be talked over before every marriage, and you
two are certainly old enough to be above affectation. Go away with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So there was nothing for it but for them to return to the library;
Mrs. Kirkpatrick pouting a little, and Mr. Gibson feeling more like
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own cool, sarcastic self, by many degrees, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had done when
last in that room.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) began, half crying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell what poor Kirkpatrick would say if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew what I have
done. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did so dislike the notion of second marriages, poor fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't know, then; or that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
is wiser--I mean, that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sees how second marriages may be most
desirable and expedient in some cases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Altogether, this second tête-à-tête, done to command, was not so
satisfactory as the first; and Mr. Gibson was quite alive to the
necessity of proceeding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) round to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) patients before very
much time had elapsed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall shake down into uniformity before long, I've no doubt,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode away. <div class="bookquote">``It's hardly to be expected that
our thoughts should run in the same groove all at once. Nor should I
like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``It would be very flat and stagnant to have only
an echo of one's own opinions from one's wife. Heigho! I must tell
Molly about it: dear little woman, I wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll take it? It's
done, in a great measure, for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lost himself in
recapitulating Mrs. Kirkpatrick's good qualities, and the advantages
to be gained to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter from the step he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had just taken.

<p/>It was too late to go round by Hamley that afternoon. The Towers and
the Towers' round lay just in the opposite direction to Hamley. So it
was the next morning before Mr. Gibson arrived at the Hall, timing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) visit as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could so as to have half-an-hour's private
talk with Molly before Mrs. Hamley came down into the drawing-room.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter would require sympathy after receiving
the intelligence he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had to communicate; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew there was no one
more fit to give it than Mrs. Hamley.

<p/>It was a brilliantly hot summer's morning; men in their shirtsleeves
were in the fields getting in the early harvest of oats; as Mr.
Gibson rode slowly along, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could see them over the tall hedge-rows,
and even hear the soothing measured sound of the fall of the long
swathes, as they were mown. The labourers seemed too hot to talk; the
dog, guarding their coats and cans, lay panting loudly on the other
side of the elm, under which Mr. Gibson stopped for an instant to
survey the scene, and gain a little delay before the interview that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wished was well over. In another minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had snapped at himself
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) weakness, and put spurs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came up to the Hall
at a good sharp trot; it was earlier than the usual time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
visits, and no one was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); all the stable-men were in
the fields, but that signified little to Mr. Gibson; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) walked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
horse about for five minutes or so before taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) into the stable,
and loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) girths, examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with perhaps unnecessary
exactitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went into the house by a private door, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
way into the drawing-room, half expecting, however, that Molly would
be in the garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been there, but it was too hot and dazzling
now for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to remain out of doors, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had come in by the open
window of the drawing-room. Oppressed with the heat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had fallen
asleep in an easy-chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bonnet and open book upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knee, one
arm hanging listlessly down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked very soft, and young, and
childlike; and a gush of love sprang into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), gently, taking the little brown hand that was
hanging down, and holding it in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``Molly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes, that for one moment had no recognition in them.
Then the light came brilliantly into them and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sprang up, and
threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) neck, exclaiming,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, my dear, dear papa! What made you come while I was asleep?
I lose the pleasure of watching for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson turned a little paler than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) still
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand, and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to a seat by him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) on a sofa, without
speaking. There was no need; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was chattering away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was up so early! It is so charming to be out here in the fresh
morning air. I think that made me sleepy. But isn't it a gloriously
hot day? I wonder if the Italian skies they talk about can be bluer
than that--that little bit you see just between the oaks--there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand away, and used both it and the other to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father's head, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should exactly see the very bit she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) meant.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was rather struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unusual silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard from Miss Eyre, papa? How are they all? And this
fever that is about? Do you know, papa, I don't think you are looking
well? You want me at home to take care of you. How soon may I come
home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I look well? That must be all your fancy, goosey. I feel
uncommonly well; and I ought to look well, for-- I have a piece of
news for you, little woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was doing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) business
very awkwardly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was determined to plunge on.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Can you guess
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tone was changed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was
evidently uneasy, as with the presage of an instinct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), again taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``that you
are in a very awkward position--a girl growing up in such a family
as mine--young men--which was a piece of confounded stupidity on my
part. And I am obliged to be away so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is Miss Eyre,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), sick with the strengthening
indefinite presage of what was to come. <div class="bookquote">``Dear Miss Eyre, I want
nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) and you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still there are times like the present when Miss Eyre cannot be with
you; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) home is not with us; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) has other duties. I've been in
great perplexity for some time; but at last I've taken a step which
will, I hope, make us both happier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going to be married again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), helping him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out, with a
quiet dry voice, and gently drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. To Mrs. Kirkpatrick--you remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)? They call her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) Clare at
the Towers. You recollect how kind she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was to you that day you were
left there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not tell what words to use. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was afraid of saying anything, lest the passion of anger,
dislike, indignation--whatever it was that was boiling up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
breast--should find vent in cries and screams, or worse, in raging
words that could never be forgotten. It was as if the piece of solid
ground on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stood had broken from the shore, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was
drifting out to the infinite sea alone.

<p/>Mr. Gibson saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) silence was unnatural, and half-guessed at
the cause of it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must have time to reconcile
herself to the idea, and still believed that it would be for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
eventual happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had, besides, the relief of feeling that the
secret was told, the confidence made, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been dreading
for the last twenty-four hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went on recapitulating all the
advantages of the marriage; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew them off by heart now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'s a very suitable age for me. I don't know how old she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) is
exactly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) must be nearly forty. I shouldn't have wished to
marry any one younger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'s highly respected by Lord and Lady Cumnor
and their family, which is of itself a character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) has very
agreeable and polished manners--of course, from the circles she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) has
been thrown into--and you and I, goosey, are apt to be a little
brusque, or so; we must brush up our manners now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No remark from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) on this little bit of playfulness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went on,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) has been accustomed to housekeeping--economical housekeeping,
too--for of late years she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) has had a school at Ashcombe, and has had,
of course, to arrange all things for a large family. And last, but
not least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) has a daughter--about your age, Molly--who, of course,
will come and live with us, and be a nice companion--a sister--for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was silent. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I was sent out of the house that all this might be quietly
arranged in my absence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Out of the bitterness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was roused
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) assumed impassiveness by the effect produced. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father started up, and quickly left the room, saying something to
himself--what, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not hear, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) through dark stone passages, into the glare of the stable-yard,
into the stables--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, papa--I'm not myself--I don't know what to say about this
hateful--detestable--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) led his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) horse out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not know if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) words. Just as
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mounted, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with a grey grim face--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's better for both of us, for me to go away now. We
may say things difficult to forget. We are both much agitated. By
to-morrow we shall be more composed; you will have thought it over,
and have seen that the principal--one great motive, I mean--was your
good. You may tell Mrs. Hamley--I meant to have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) myself. I
will come again to-morrow. Good-by, Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For many minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had ridden away--long after the sound of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) horse's hoofs on the round stones of the paved lane, beyond the
home-meadows, had died away--Molly stood there, shading her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes,
and looking at the empty space of air in which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) form had last
appeared. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) very breath seemed suspended; only, two or three times,
after long intervals, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) drew a miserable sigh, which was caught up
into a sob. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) turned away at last, but could not go into the house,
could not tell Mrs. Hamley, could not forget how her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father had
looked and spoken--and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) went out through a side-door--it was the way by which the
gardeners passed when they took the manure into the garden--and the
walk to which it led was concealed from sight as much as possible by
shrubs and evergreens and over-arching trees. No one would know what
became of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)--and, with the ingratitude of misery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) added to
herself, no one would care. Mrs. Hamley had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own husband, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own
children, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) close home interests--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was very good and kind, but
there was a bitter grief in Molly's heart, with which the stranger
could not intermeddle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went quickly on to the bourne which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had fixed for herself--a seat almost surrounded by the drooping
leaves of a weeping-ash--a seat on the long broad terrace walk on
the other side of the wood, that overlooked the pleasant slope of
the meadows beyond. The walk had probably been made to command this
sunny, peaceful landscape, with trees, and a church spire, two or
three red-tiled roofs of old cottages, and a purple bit of rising
ground in the distance; and at some previous date, when there might
have been a large family of Hamleys residing at the Hall, ladies
in hoops, and gentlemen in bag-wigs with swords by their sides,
might have filled up the breadth of the terrace, as they sauntered,
smiling, along. But no one ever cared to saunter there now. It was a
deserted walk. The squire or his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) sons might cross it in passing to a
little gate that led to the meadow beyond; but no one loitered there.
Molly almost thought that no one knew of the hidden seat under the
ash-tree but herself; for there were not more gardeners employed upon
the grounds than were necessary to keep the kitchen-gardens and such
of the ornamental part as was frequented by the family, or in sight
of the house, in good order.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had once got to the seat she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) broke out with suppressed
passion of grief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not care to analyze the sources of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
tears and sobs--her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father was going to be married again--her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father
was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had done very wrong--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had gone away
displeased; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) love; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going to be married--away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)--away from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little daughter--forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
own dear, dear mother. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought in a tumultuous kind of way,
sobbing till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was wearied out, and had to gain strength by being
quiet for a time, to break forth into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) passion of tears afresh.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had cast herself on the ground--that natural throne for violent
sorrow--and leant up against the old moss-grown seat; sometimes
burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands; sometimes clasping them together, as
if by the tight painful grasp of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fingers she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could deaden mental
suffering.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not see Roger Hamley returning from the meadows, nor hear the
click of the little white gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had been out dredging in ponds and
ditches, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) wet sling-net, with its imprisoned treasures of
nastiness, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was coming home to lunch, having
always a fine midday appetite, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) pretended to despise the
meal in theory. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mother liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) companionship
then; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) depended much upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) luncheon, and was seldom downstairs
and visible to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family much before the time. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) overcame his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
theory, for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mother, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) reward in the hearty
relish with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) company in eating.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) did not see Molly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) crossed the terrace-walk on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) way
homewards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had gone about twenty yards along the small wood-path
at right angles to the terrace, when, looking among the grass and
wild plants under the trees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) spied out one which was rare, one
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had been long wishing to find in flower, and saw it at last,
with those bright keen eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>). Down went his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) net, skilfully
twisted so as to retain its contents, while it lay amid the herbage,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) himself went with light and well-planted footsteps in search
of the treasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was so great a lover of nature that, without any
thought, but habitually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) always avoided treading unnecessarily on
any plant; who knew what long-sought growth or insect might develop
itself in that which now appeared but insignificant?

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) steps led him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) in the direction of the ash-tree seat, much less
screened from observation on this side than on the terrace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
stopped; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) saw a light-coloured dress on the ground--somebody
half-lying on the seat, so still just then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) wondered if the
person, whoever it was, had fallen ill or fainted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) paused to
watch. In a minute or two the sobs broke out again--the words. It was
Miss Gibson crying out in a broken voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, papa! if you would but come back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>For a minute or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thought it would be kinder to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
fancying herself unobserved; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had even made a retrograde step or
two, on tip-toe; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) heard the miserable sobbing again. It
was farther than his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mother could walk, or else, be the sorrow what
it would, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was the natural comforter of this girl, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) visitor.
However, whether it was right or wrong, delicate or obtrusive, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) heard the sad voice talking again, in such tones of uncomforted,
lonely misery, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) turned back, and went to the green tent under the
ash-tree. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) started up when he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) came thus close to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tried to
check her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sobs, and instinctively smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wet tangled hair back
with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) looked down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with grave, kind sympathy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) did not
know exactly what to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it lunch-time?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), trying to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) did not see
the traces of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tears and the disturbance of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) features--that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lying, sobbing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart out there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I was going home to lunch. But--you must let me
say it--I couldn't go on when I saw your distress. Has anything
happened?--anything in which I can help you, I mean; for, of course,
I've no right to make the inquiry, if it is any private sorrow, in
which I can be of no use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had exhausted herself so much with crying, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could neither stand nor walk just yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sate down on the seat,
and sighed, and turned so pale, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was going to faint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>),--quite unnecessarily, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not
have stirred,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was off like a shot to some spring of water
that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) knew of in the wood, and in a minute or two he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) returned with
careful steps, bringing a little in a broad green leaf, turned into
an impromptu cup. Little as it was, it did her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) good.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I can walk back now, in a short time. Don't
stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must let me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``my mother wouldn't like me to leave you
to come home alone, while you are so faint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So they remained in silence for a little while; he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), breaking off and
examining one or two abnormal leaves of the ash-tree, partly from the
custom of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) nature, partly to give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) time to recover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa is going to be married again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), at length.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not have said why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) this; an instant before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no intention of doing so. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) dropped the leaf he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) held
in his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) hand, turned round, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) poor wistful eyes
were filling with tears as they met his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), with a dumb appeal for
sympathy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) look was much more eloquent than her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) words. There was
a momentary pause before he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) replied, and then it was more because he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) must say something than that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was in any doubt as to
the answer to the question he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sorry for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes away from his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), as her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) quivering lips formed
the word <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>though her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice made no sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was silent again
now; looking on the ground, kicking softly at a loose pebble with his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
foot. His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) thoughts did not come readily to the surface in the shape
of words; nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) apt at giving comfort till he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) way clear
to the real source from which consolation must come. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
spoke,--almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was reasoning out the matter with himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems as if there might be cases where--setting the question of
love entirely on one side--it must be almost a duty to find some one
to be a substitute for the mother... I can believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), in
a different tone of voice, and looking at Molly afresh, <div class="bookquote">``that this
step may be greatly for your father's happiness--it may relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
from many cares, and may give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a pleasant companion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had me. You don't know what we were to each other--at least, what
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) added, humbly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must have thought it for the best, or he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wouldn't have done
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may have thought it the best for your sake even more than for
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tried to convince me of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger began kicking the pebble again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not got hold of the
right end of the clue. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) looked up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you of a girl I know. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother died when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
about sixteen--the eldest of a large family. From that time--all
through the bloom of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) youth--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave herself up to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father,
first as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comforter, afterwards as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) companion, friend,
secretary--anything you like. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a man with a great deal of
business on hand, and often came home only to set to afresh to
preparations for the next day's work. Harriet was always there, ready
to help, to talk, or to be silent. It went on for eight or ten years
in this way; and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father married again,--a woman not many
years older than Harriet herself. Well--they are just the happiest
set of people I know--you wouldn't have thought it likely, would
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was listening, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had no heart to say anything. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was
interested in this little story of Harriet--a girl who had been so
much to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, more than Molly in this early youth of hers could
have been to Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``How was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sighed out at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's happiness before she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>Roger answered, with something of severe brevity. Molly needed
the bracing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began to cry again a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it were for papa's happiness--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must believe that it is. Whatever you fancy, give him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) a chance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) cannot have much comfort, I should think, if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) sees you fretting
or pining,--you who have been so much to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), as you say. The lady
herself, too--if Harriet's stepmother had been a selfish woman, and
been always clutching after the gratification of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own wishes; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was as anxious for Harriet to be happy as Harriet
was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father--and your father's future wife may be another of
the same kind, though such people are rare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>murmured Molly, a waft of
recollection bringing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind the details of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) day at the
Towers long ago.

<p/>Roger did not want to hear Molly's reasons for this doubting speech.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had no right to hear more of Mr. Gibson's family
life, past, present, or to come, than was absolutely necessary for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might comfort and help the crying girl, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
had come upon so unexpectedly. And besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wanted to go home, and
be with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mother at lunch-time. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is right to hope for the best about everybody, and not to expect
the worst. This sounds like a truism, but it has comforted me before
now, and some day you'll find it useful. One has always to try to
think more of others than of oneself, and it is best not to prejudge
people on the bad side. My sermons aren't long, are they? Have they
given you an appetite for lunch? Sermons always make me hungry, I
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) appeared to be waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to get up and come along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>),
as indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) meant her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) should not
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rose up languidly, too languid to say how much she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
should prefer being left alone, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would only go away without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was very weak, and stumbled over the straggling root of a tree
that projected across the path. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), watchful though silent, saw
this stumble, and putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up from falling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
still held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand when the occasion was past; this little physical
failure impressed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart how young and helpless she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) yearned to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), remembering the passion of sorrow in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
found her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and longing to be of some little tender bit of comfort to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), before they parted--before their tête-à-tête walk was merged in
the general familiarity of the household life. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not know
what to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will have thought me hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) burst out at length, as they
were nearing the drawing-room windows and the garden-door. <div class="bookquote">``I
never can manage to express what I feel--somehow I always fall to
philosophizing--but I am sorry for you. Yes, I am; it's beyond my
power to help you, as far as altering facts goes, but I can feel for
you, in a way which it's best not to talk about, for it can do no
good. Remember how sorry I am for you! I shall often be thinking of
you, though I daresay it's best not to talk about it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I know you are sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>under her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breath, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
broke away, and ran indoors, and upstairs to the solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own
room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mother, who was sitting before the
untasted luncheon, as much annoyed by the mysterious unpunctuality
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) visitor as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was capable of being with anything; for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had heard that Mr. Gibson had been, and was gone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not
discover if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had left any message for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anxiety about
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own health, which some people esteemed hypochondriacal, always
made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) particularly craving for the wisdom which might fall from
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doctor's lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you been, Roger? Where is Molly?--Miss Gibson, I mean,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was careful to keep up a barrier of forms between the young
man and young woman who were thrown together in the same household.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been out dredging. -LRB-By the way, I left my net on the terrace
walk.-RRB- I found Miss Gibson sitting there, crying as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart

again, almost stunned with surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hammond</b></font>) going to marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I didn't ask, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) didn't tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) the best advice in my power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on what you mean by advice. Hush! here she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>To their surprise, Molly came in, trying hard to look as usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had bathed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes, and arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hair; and was making a great
struggle to keep from crying, and to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) voice into order.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was unwilling to distress Mrs. Hamley by the sight of pain and
suffering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) did not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was following Roger's injunction
to think more of others than of herself--but so she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was. Mrs. Hamley
was not sure if it was wise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to begin on the piece of news she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
had just heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) son; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was too full of it herself to
talk of anything else. <div class="bookquote">``So I hear your father is going to be married,

badly--oh, Mrs. Hamley, I did behave so badly to papa this morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) rose up and threw herself into Mrs. Hamley's arms, and sobbed
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) breast. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sorrow was not now for the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father
was going to be married again, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own ill-behaviour.

<p/>If Roger was not tender in words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was in deeds. Unreasonable and
possibly exaggerated as Molly's grief had appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), it was
real suffering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) took some pains to lighten it, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
own way, which was characteristic enough. That evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) adjusted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) microscope, and put the treasures he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had collected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
morning's ramble on a little table; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother to
come and admire. Of course Molly came too, and this was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had
intended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tried to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pursuit, cherished her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
first little morsel of curiosity, and nursed it into a very proper
desire for further information. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brought out books on the
subject, and translated the slightly pompous and technical language
into homely every-day speech. Molly had come down to dinner,
wondering how the long hours till bedtime would ever pass away:
hours during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must not speak on the one thing that would
be occupying her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind to the exclusion of all others; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was
afraid that already she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had wearied Mrs. Hamley with it during their
afternoon tête-à-tête. But prayers and bedtime came long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
expected; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had been refreshed by a new current of thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
was very thankful to Roger. And now there was to-morrow to come, and
a confession of penitence to be made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father.

<p/>But Mr. Gibson did not want speech or words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not fond of
expressions of feeling at any time, and perhaps, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt that
the less said the better on a subject about which it was evident that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) were not thoroughly and impulsively in harmony.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) read her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) repentance in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) saw how much she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had suffered;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had a sharp pang at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart in consequence. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stopped
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) from speaking out her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) regret at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) behaviour the day before, by
a <div class="bookquote">``There, there, that will do. I know all you want to say. I know my
little Molly--my silly little goosey--better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knows herself.
I've brought you an invitation. Lady Cumnor wants you to go and spend
next Thursday at the Towers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish me to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heart sinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you and Hyacinth to become better acquainted--to learn to
love each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hyacinth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, entirely bewildered.

<p/>``Yes; Hyacinth! It's the silliest name I ever heard of; but it's
hers, and I must call her (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) by it. I can't bear Clare, which is
what my lady and all the family at the Towers call her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and <div class="bookquote">``Mrs.
Kirkpatrick' is formal and nonsensical too, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'ll change her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) name
so soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were living in a
strange, unknown world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till after Michaelmas.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then, continuing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own
thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``And the worst is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'s gone and perpetuated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
own affected name by having her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) daughter called after her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>). Cynthia!
One thinks of the moon, and the man in the moon with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bundle of
faggots. I'm thankful you're plain Molly, child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old is she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)--Cynthia, I mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, get accustomed to the name. I should think Cynthia Kirkpatrick
was about as old as you are. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'s at school in France, picking up
airs and graces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'s to come home for the wedding, so you'll be
able to get acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) then; though, I think, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'s to go
back again for another half-year or so.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XI.

<p/>MAKING FRIENDSHIP.


<p/>Mr. Gibson believed that Cynthia Kirkpatrick was to return to England
to be present at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) mother's wedding; but Mrs. Kirkpatrick had
no such intention. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was not what is commonly called a woman
of determination; but somehow what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) disliked she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) avoided, and
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) liked she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) tried to do, or to have. So although in the
conversation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had already led to, as to the when and the
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was to be married, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had listened quietly to Mr. Gibson's
proposal that Molly and Cynthia should be the two bridesmaids, still
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had felt how disagreeable it would be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) young
daughter flashing out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) beauty by the side of the faded bride, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
mother; and as the further arrangements for the wedding became more
definite, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw further reasons in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own mind for Cynthia's
remaining quietly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) school at Boulogne.

<p/>Mrs. Kirkpatrick had gone to bed that first night of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) engagement
to Mr. Gibson, fully anticipating a speedy marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) looked to
it as a release from the thraldom of keeping school--keeping an
unprofitable school, with barely pupils enough to pay for house
rent and taxes, food, washing, and the requisite masters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) saw
no reason for ever going back to Ashcombe, except to wind up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
affairs, and to pack up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) clothes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) hoped that Mr. Gibson's
ardour would be such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would press on the marriage, and urge
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) never to resume her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) school drudgery, but to relinquish it now and
for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) even made up a very pretty, very passionate speech for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) own mind; quite sufficiently strong to prevail upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>),
and to overthrow the scruples which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) ought to have, at
telling the parents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) pupils that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) did not intend to resume
school, and that they must find another place of education for their
daughters, in the last week but one of the midsummer holidays.

<p/>It was rather like a douche of cold water on Mrs. Kirkpatrick's
plans, when the next morning at breakfast Lady Cumnor began to decide
upon the arrangements and duties of the two middle-aged lovers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you can't give up your school all at once, Clare. The
wedding can't be before Christmas, but that will do very well. We
shall all be down at the Towers; and it will be a nice amusement for
the children to go over to Ashcombe, and see you married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think--I am afraid--I don't believe Mr. Gibson will like waiting
so long; men are so impatient under these circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nonsense! Lord Cumnor has recommended you to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) tenants, and
I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wouldn't like them to be put to any inconvenience. Mr.
Gibson will see that in a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s a man of sense, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
wouldn't be our family doctor. Now, what are you going to do about
your little girl? Have you fixed yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Yesterday there seemed so little time, and when one is agitated
it is so difficult to think of anything. Cynthia is nearly eighteen,
old enough to go out as a governess, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wishes it, but I don't
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is so generous and kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! I must give you time to settle some of your affairs to-day.
Don't waste it in sentiment, you're too old for that. Come to a clear
understanding with each other; it will be for your happiness in the
long run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So they did come to a clear understanding about one or two things.
To Mrs. Kirkpatrick's dismay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) found that Mr. Gibson had no more
idea than Lady Cumnor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) breaking faith with the parents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
pupils. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) really was at a serious loss as to what was to
become of Molly till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could be under the protection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) new
wife at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own home, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) domestic worries teased him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) more
and more every day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was too honourable to think of persuading Mrs.
Kirkpatrick to give up school a week sooner than was right for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
sake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not even perceive how easy the task of persuasion would
be; with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) winning wiles she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) could scarcely lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to feel
impatience for the wedding to take place at Michaelmas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly tell you what a comfort and relief it will be to me,
Hyacinth, when you are once my wife--the mistress of my home--poor
little Molly's mother and protector; but I wouldn't interfere with
your previous engagements for the world. It wouldn't be right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my own love. How good you are! So many men would think
only of their own wishes and interests! I'm sure the parents of
my dear pupils will admire you--will be quite surprised at your
consideration for their interests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell them, then. I hate being admired. Why shouldn't you say
it is your wish to keep on your school till they've had time to look
out for another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), daring all. ``I long to be making you
happy; I want to make your home a place of rest and comfort to you;
and I do so wish to cherish your sweet Molly, as I hope to do, when
I come to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother. I can't take virtue to myself which doesn't
belong to me. If I have to speak for myself, I shall say, ``Good
people, find a school for your daughters by Michaelmas,--for after
that time I must go and make the happiness of others.<div class="bookquote">'' I can't bear
to think of your long rides in November--coming home wet at night
with no one to take care of you. Oh! if you leave it to me, I shall
advise the parents to take their daughters away from the care of one
whose heart will be absent. Though I couldn't consent to any time
before Michaelmas--that wouldn't be fair or right, and I'm sure you
wouldn't urge me--you are too good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you think that they will consider we have acted uprightly
by them, let it be Michaelmas with all my heart. What does Lady
Cumnor say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) I was afraid you wouldn't like waiting, because of
your difficulties with your servants, and because of Molly--it would
be so desirable to enter on the new relationship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as soon as
possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure; so it would. Poor child! I'm afraid the intelligence of
my engagement has rather startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia will feel it deeply, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Kirkpatrick, unwilling
to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) daughter be behind Mr. Gibson's in sensibility and
affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) over to the wedding! She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) and Molly shall be
bridesmaids,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, in the unguarded warmth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart.

<p/>This plan did not quite suit Mrs. Kirkpatrick: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) thought it
best not to oppose it, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had a presentable excuse to give,
and perhaps also some reason would naturally arise out of future
circumstances; so at this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) only smiled, and softly pressed
the hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) held in hers.

<p/>It is a question whether Mrs. Kirkpatrick or Molly wished the most
for the day to be over which they were to spend together at the
Towers. Mrs. Kirkpatrick was rather weary of girls as a class. All
the trials of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) life were connected with girls in some way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was
very young when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) first became a governess, and had been worsted
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) struggles with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) pupils, in the first place she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) ever went
to. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) elegance of appearance and manner, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) accomplishments,
more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) character and acquirements, had rendered it easier
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) than for most to obtain good <div class="bookquote">``situations;''  (<font color='red'><b>character acquirements</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had been
absolutely petted in some; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was constantly encountering
naughty or stubborn, or over-conscientious, or severe-judging, or
curious and observant girls. And again, before Cynthia was born, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
had longed for a boy, thinking it possible that if some three or
four intervening relations died, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might come to be a baronet; and
instead of a son, lo and behold it was a daughter! Nevertheless, with
all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dislike to girls in the abstract as <div class="bookquote">``the plagues of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life''
 (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) aversion was not diminished by the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) having kept
a school for <div class="bookquote">``young ladies''  (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div>at Ashcombe-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) really meant to be as
kind as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could be to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) new step-daughter, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) remembered
principally as a black-haired, sleepy child, in whose eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had
read admiration of herself. Mrs. Kirkpatrick accepted Mr. Gibson
principally because she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was tired of the struggle of earning her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) own
livelihood; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) personally--nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) even loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) torpid way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) intended to be good to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) felt as if it would have been easier for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) to have been good to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) son.

<p/>Molly was bracing herself up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) way too. <div class="bookquote">``I will be like Harriet.
I will think of others. I won't think of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) kept repeating
all the way to the Towers. But there was no selfishness in wishing
that the day was come to an end, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did very heartily. Mrs.
Hamley sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thither in the carriage, which was to wait and bring
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) back at night. Mrs. Hamley wanted Molly to make a favourable
impression, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to come and show herself before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
set out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't put on your silk gown--your white muslin will look the nicest,
my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not my silk? it is quite new! I had it to come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, I think your white muslin suits you the best.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anything but
that horrid plaid silk''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>was the thought in Mrs. Hamley's mind; and,
thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), Molly set off for the Towers, looking a little quaint,
it is true, but thoroughly lady-like, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was old-fashioned. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father was to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) there; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been detained, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
to face Mrs. Kirkpatrick by herself, the recollection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) last
day of misery at the Towers fresh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind as if it had been
yesterday. Mrs. Kirkpatrick was as caressing as could be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) held
Molly's hand in hers, as they sate together in the library, after the
first salutations were over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) kept stroking it from time to time,
and purring out inarticulate sounds of loving satisfaction, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
gazed in the blushing face.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: THE NEW MAMMA.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``What eyes! so like your dear father's! How we shall love each
other--shan't we, darling? For his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, bravely; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
sentence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you've just got the same beautiful black curling hair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Kirkpatrick, softly lifting one of Molly's curls from off her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
white temple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa's hair is growing grey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it? I never see it. I never shall see it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will always be to me
the handsomest of men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson was really a very handsome man, and Molly was pleased with
the compliment; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not help saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will grow old, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) hair will grow grey. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will
be just as handsome, but it won't be as a young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that's just it, love. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll always be handsome; some people
always are. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is so fond of you, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly's colour flashed
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not want an assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own father's love
from this strange woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not help being angry; all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
could do was to keep silent. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speaks of you;
`his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little treasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) calls you. I'm almost jealous
sometimes.''

<p/>Molly took her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart began to harden; these
speeches were so discordant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) teeth together,
and <div class="bookquote">``tried to be good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so happy. I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had a great deal to

tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>seeing the cloud in Molly's eyes, <div class="bookquote">``what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes and
dislikes, for of course you will know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly's face cleared a little; of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had not
watched and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so long without believing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) understood
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) better than any one else: though how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had come to like Mrs.
Kirkpatrick enough to wish to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), was an unsolved problem that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) unconsciously put aside as inexplicable. Mrs. Kirkpatrick went
on,--<div class="bookquote">``All men have their fancies and antipathies, even the wisest.
I have known some gentlemen annoyed beyond measure by the merest
trifles; leaving a door open, or spilling tea in their saucers, or
a shawl crookedly put on. Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) voice,
<div class="bookquote">``I know of a house to which Lord Hollingford will never be asked
again because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) didn't wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) shoes on both the mats in the hall!
Now you must tell me what your dear father dislikes most in these
fanciful ways, and I shall take care to avoid it. You must be my
little friend and helper in pleasing him (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>). It will be such a pleasure
to me to attend to his (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) slightest fancies. About my dress, too--what
colours does he (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) like best? I want to do everything in my power with a
view to his (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) approval.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was gratified by all this, and began to think that really,
after all, perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father had done well for himself; and that
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could help towards his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) new happiness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ought to do it. So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tried very conscientiously to think over Mr. Gibson's wishes and
ways; to ponder over what annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) the most in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) household.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``papa isn't particular about many things; but I
think our not having the dinner quite punctual--quite ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) comes in, fidgets him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) more than anything. You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has
often had a long ride, and there is another long ride to come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
has only half-an-hour--sometimes only a quarter--to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) dinner
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my own love. Punctuality! Yes; it's a great thing in a
household. It's what I've had to enforce with my young ladies at
Ashcombe. No wonder poor dear Mr. Gibson has been displeased at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
dinner not being ready, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) so hard-worked!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa doesn't care what he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) has, if it's only ready. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) would take
bread-and-cheese, if cook would only send it in instead of dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bread-and-cheese! Does Mr. Gibson eat cheese?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s very fond of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, innocently. <div class="bookquote">``I've known
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eat toasted cheese when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) has been too tired to fancy anything
else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but, my dear, we must change all that. I shouldn't like to
think of your father eating cheese; it's such a strong-smelling,
coarse kind of thing. We must get him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a cook who can toss him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up an
omelette, or something elegant. Cheese is only fit for the kitchen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa is very fond of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>persevered Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but we will cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) of that. I couldn't bear the smell of
cheese; and I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) would be sorry to annoy me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was silent; it did not do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found, to be too minute in
telling about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's likes or dislikes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had better leave
them for Mrs. Kirkpatrick to find out for herself. It was an awkward
pause; each was trying to find something agreeable to say. Molly
spoke at length. <div class="bookquote">``Please! I should so like to know something about
Cynthia--your daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, call her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) Cynthia. It's a pretty name, isn't it? Cynthia
Kirkpatrick. Not so pretty, though, as my old name, Hyacinth Clare.
People used to say it suited me so well. I must show you an acrostic
that a gentleman--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a lieutenant in the 53rd--made upon it. Oh!
we shall have a great deal to say to each other, I foresee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But about Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! about dear Cynthia. What do you want to know, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was to live with us! When will she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, was it not sweet of your kind father? I thought of nothing
else but Cynthia's going out as a governess when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had completed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) education; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has been brought up for it, and has had great
advantages. But good dear Mr. Gibson wouldn't hear of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said
yesterday that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) must come and live with us when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) left school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When will she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) leave school?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went for two years. I don't think I must let her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) leave before

summer she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) shall come home, and then shan't we be a happy little

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is to come to the wedding, isn't
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went on timidly, not knowing how far Mrs. Kirkpatrick would
like the allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father has begged for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to come; but we must think about it a
little more before quite fixing it. The journey is a great expense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) like you? I do so want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is very handsome, people say. In the bright-coloured
style,--perhaps something like what I was. But I like the dark-haired
foreign kind of beauty best--just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>touching Molly's hair, and
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with an expression of sentimental remembrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Cynthia--is she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) very clever and accomplished?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, a
little afraid lest the answer should remove Miss Kirkpatrick at too
great a distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ought to be; I've paid ever so much money to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) taught by
the best masters. But you will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) before long, and I'm afraid we
must go now to Lady Cumnor. It has been very charming having you all
to myself, but I know Lady Cumnor will be expecting us now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
was very curious to see you,--my future daughter, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) calls you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly followed Mrs. Kirkpatrick into the morning-room, where Lady
Cumnor was sitting--a little annoyed, because, having completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
toilette earlier than usual, Clare had not been aware by instinct
of the fact, and so had not brought Molly Gibson for inspection a
quarter of an hour before. Every small occurrence is an event in
the day of a convalescent invalid, and a little while ago Molly
would have met with patronizing appreciation, where now she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had to
encounter criticism. Of Lady Cumnor's character as an individual she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
knew nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) only knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was going to see and be seen by a
live countess; nay, more, by <div class="bookquote">''_the_ countess''  (<font color='red'><b>a countess</b></font>)</div>of Hollingford.

<p/>Mrs. Kirkpatrick led her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) into Lady Cumnor's presence by the hand, and
in presenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), said,--<div class="bookquote">``My dear little daughter, Lady Cumnor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Clare, don't let me have nonsense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is not your daughter
yet, and may never be,--I believe that one-third of the engagements
I have heard of, have never come to marriages. Miss Gibson, I am very
glad to see you, for your father's sake; when I know you better, I
hope it will be for your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly very heartily hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might never be known any better
by the stern-looking lady who sate so upright in the easy chair,
prepared for lounging, and which therefore gave all the more effect
to the stiff attitude. Lady Cumnor luckily took Molly's silence for
acquiescent humility, and went on speaking after a further little
pause of inspection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) looks, Clare. You may make something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).
It will be a great advantage to you, my dear, to have a lady who has
trained up several young people of quality always about you just at
the time when you are growing up. I'll tell you what, Clare!'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--a
sudden thought striking her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``you and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) must become better
acquainted--you know nothing of each other at present; you are not
to be married till Christmas, and what could be better than that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) should go back with you to Ashcombe! She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would be with you
constantly, and have the advantage of the companionship of your young
people, which would be a good thing for an only child! It's a capital
plan; I'm very glad I thought of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Now it would be difficult to say which of Lady Cumnor's two hearers
was the most dismayed at the idea which had taken possession of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). Mrs. Kirkpatrick had no fancy for being encumbered with a
step-daughter before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) time. If Molly came to be an inmate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
house, farewell to many little background economies, and a still
more serious farewell to many little indulgences, that were innocent
enough in themselves, but which Mrs. Kirkpatrick's former life
had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) to look upon as sins to be concealed: the dirty
dog's-eared delightful novel from the Ashcombe circulating library,
the leaves of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) turned over with a pair of scissors; the
lounging-chair which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had for use at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) own home, straight and
upright as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) sate now in Lady Cumnor's presence; the dainty morsel,
savoury and small, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) treated herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own solitary
supper,--all these and many other similarly pleasant things would
have to be foregone if Molly came to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pupil, parlour-boarder,
or visitor, as Lady Cumnor was planning. One--two things Clare was
instinctively resolved upon: to be married at Michaelmas, and not
to have Molly at Ashcombe. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) smiled as sweetly as if the plan
proposed was the most charming project in the world, while all the
time her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) poor brains were beating about in every bush for the reasons
or excuses of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should make use at some future time. Molly,
however, saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) all this trouble. It was a question which of the
three was the most surprised by the words which burst out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not mean to speak, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart was very full, and
almost before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard herself
saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it would be nice at all. I mean, my lady, that I
should dislike it very much; it would be taking me away from papa
just these very few last months. I will like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went on,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes full of tears; and, turning to Mrs. Kirkpatrick, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) future stepmother's with the prettiest and most
trustful action. <div class="bookquote">``I will try hard to love you, and to do all I can
to make you happy; but you must not take me away from papa just this
very last bit of time that I shall have him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Kirkpatrick fondled the hand thus placed in hers, and was
grateful to the girl for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) outspoken opposition to Lady Cumnor's
plan. Clare was, however, exceedingly unwilling to back up Molly
by any words of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own until Lady Cumnor had spoken and given the
cue. But there was something in Molly's little speech, or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
straightforward manner, that amused instead of irritating Lady Cumnor
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) present mood. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was tired of the silkiness with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had been shut up for so many days.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) glasses, and looked at them both before speaking. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, young lady! Why, Clare, you've got your work
before you! Not but what there is a good deal of truth in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
says. It must be very disagreeable to a girl of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) age to have a
stepmother coming in between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father and herself, whatever may be
the advantages to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the long run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly almost felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could make a friend of the stiff old
countess, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) clearness of sight as to the plan proposed being
a trial; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was afraid, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) new-born desire of thinking for
others, of Mrs. Kirkpatrick being hurt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) need not have feared as
far as outward signs went, for the smile was still on that lady's
pretty rosy lips, and the soft fondling of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand never stopped.
Lady Cumnor was more interested in Molly the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>);
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gaze was pretty steady through her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gold-rimmed eye-glasses.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began a sort of catechism; a string of very straightforward
questions, such as any lady under the rank of countess might have
scrupled to ask, but which were not unkindly meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sixteen, are you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I am seventeen. My birthday was three weeks ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much the same thing, I should think. Have you ever been to
school?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, never! Miss Eyre has taught me everything I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Umph! Miss Eyre was your governess, I suppose? I should not have
thought your father could have afforded to keep a governess. But of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must know his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own affairs best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>replied Molly, a little touchy as to any
reflections on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's wisdom.

<p/>``You say ``certainly!<div class="bookquote">'' as if it was a matter of course that every
one should know their own affairs best. You are very young, Miss
Gibson--very. You'll know better before you come to my age. And I
suppose you've been taught music, and the use of globes, and French,
and all the usual accomplishments, since you have had a governess? I
never heard of such nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went on, lashing herself up. <div class="bookquote">``An
only daughter! If there had been half-a-dozen, there might have been
some sense in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly did not speak, but it was by a strong effort that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) kept
silence. Mrs. Kirkpatrick fondled her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) hand more perseveringly than
ever, hoping thus to express a sufficient amount of sympathy to
prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) from saying anything injudicious. But the caress had
become wearisome to Molly, and only irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) nerves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand out of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's, with a slight manifestation of
impatience.

<p/>It was, perhaps, fortunate for the general peace that just at this
moment Mr. Gibson was announced. It is odd enough to see how the
entrance of a person of the opposite sex into an assemblage of either
men or women calms down the little discordances and the disturbance
of mood. It was the case now; at Mr. Gibson's entrance my lady took
off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glasses, and smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brow; Mrs. Kirkpatrick managed
to get up a very becoming blush, and as for Molly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face glowed
with delight, and the white teeth and pretty dimples came out like
sunlight on a landscape.

<p/>Of course, after the first greeting, my lady had to have a private
interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doctor; and Molly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) future stepmother
wandered about in the gardens with their arms round each other's
waists, or hand in hand, like two babes in the wood; Mrs. Kirkpatrick
active in such endearments, Molly passive, and feeling within herself
very shy and strange; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had that particular kind of shy modesty
which makes any one uncomfortable at receiving caresses from a person
towards whom the heart does not go forth with an impulsive welcome.

<p/>Then came the early dinner; Lady Cumnor having hers in the quiet of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own room, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was still a prisoner. Once or twice during
the meal, the idea crossed Molly's mind that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father disliked his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
position as a middle-aged lover being made so evident to the men in
waiting as it was by Mrs. Kirkpatrick's affectionate speeches and
innuendos. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tried to banish every tint of pink sentimentalism from
the conversation, and to confine it to matter of fact; and when Mrs.
Kirkpatrick would persevere in referring to such things as had a
bearing on the future relationship of the parties, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) insisted upon
viewing them in the most matter-of-fact way; and this continued even
after the men had left the room. An old rhyme Molly had heard Betty
use, would keep running in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) uneasy,--

<p/>Two is company,
Three is trumpery.

<p/>But where could she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) go to in that strange house? What ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to
do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was roused from this fit of wonder and abstraction by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father's saying--<div class="bookquote">``What do you think of this plan of Lady Cumnor's?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was advising you to have Molly as a visitor at Ashcombe
until we are married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Kirkpatrick's countenance fell. If only Molly would be so good
as to testify again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had done before Lady Cumnor! But if the
proposal was made by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) father, it would come to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter from
a different quarter than it had done from a strange lady, be she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
ever so great. Molly did not say anything; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only looked pale, and
wistful, and anxious. Mrs. Kirkpatrick had to speak for herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a charming plan, only--Well! we know why we would rather
not have it, don't we, love? And we won't tell papa, for fear of
making him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) vain. No! I think I must leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with you, dear Mr.
Gibson, to have you all to herself for these last few weeks. It would
be cruel to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you know, my dear, I told you of the reason why it does not do
to have Molly at home just at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, eagerly. For
the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) future wife, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt it necessary
to remember that, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) foibles, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would be able to stand
between Molly and any such adventures as that which had occurred
lately with Mr. Coxe; so that one of the good reasons for the step he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>)
had taken was always present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>), while it had slipped off the
smooth surface of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's mirror-like mind without leaving
any impression. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) now recalled it, on seeing Mr. Gibson's anxious
face.

<p/>But what were Molly's feelings at these last words of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been sent from home for some reason, kept a secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
but told to this strange woman. Was there to be perfect confidence
between these two, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be for ever shut out? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and what
concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--though how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not know--to be discussed between
them for the future, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be kept in the dark? A bitter pang
of jealousy made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart-sick. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might as well go to Ashcombe,
or anywhere else, now. Thinking more of others' happiness than
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own was very fine; but did it not mean giving up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) very
individuality, quenching all the warm love, the true desires, that
made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself? Yet in this deadness lay her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only comfort; or so it
seemed. Wandering in such mazes, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hardly knew how the conversation
went on; a third was indeed <div class="bookquote">``trumpery,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>where there was entire
confidence between the two who were company, from which the other was
shut out. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was positively unhappy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father did not appear
to see it; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was absorbed with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) new plans and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) new wife that
was to be. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did notice it; and was truly sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little
girl: only he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought that there was a greater chance for the future
harmony of the household, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not lead Molly to define her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
present feelings by putting them into words. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) general plan
to repress emotion by not showing the sympathy he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt. Yet, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had to leave, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took Molly's hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and held it there, in such
a different manner to that in which Mrs. Kirkpatrick had done; and
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice softened to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) good-by, and added the
words -LRB-most unusual to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had held up all the day bravely; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had not shown anger, or
repugnance, or annoyance, or regret; but when once more by herself in
the Hamley carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) burst into a passion of tears, and cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
fill till she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) reached the village of Hamley. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) tried in vain
to smooth her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) face into smiles, and do away with the other signs of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) grief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) only hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) could run upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own room
without notice, and bathe her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) eyes in cold water before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was seen.
But at the Hall-door she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was caught by the squire and Roger coming in
from an after-dinner stroll in the garden, and hospitably anxious to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to alight. Roger saw the state of things in an instant, and
saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother has been looking for you to come back for this last hour,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) led the way to the drawing-room. But Mrs. Hamley was not there;
the Squire had stopped to speak to the coachman about one of the
horses; they two were alone. Roger said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you've had a very trying day. I have thought of you
several times, for I know how awkward these new relations are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) lips trembling, and on the point of crying
again. <div class="bookquote">``I did try to remember what you said, and to think more of
others, but it is so difficult sometimes; you know it is, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), gravely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was gratified by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) simple confession
of having borne his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) words of advice in mind, and tried to act up to
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was but a very young man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was honestly flattered;
perhaps this led him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) on to offer more advice, and this time it was
evidently mingled with sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not want to draw out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
confidence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt might very easily be done with such a
simple girl; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wished to help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a few of the
principles on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had learnt to rely. <div class="bookquote">``It is difficult,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went
on, <div class="bookquote">``but by-and-by you will be so much happier for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It will be very dull
when I shall have killed myself, as it were, and live only in trying
to do, and to be, as other people like. I don't see any end to it.
I might as well never have lived. And as for the happiness you speak
of, I shall never be happy again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an unconscious depth in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, that Roger did not
know how to answer at the moment; it was easier to address himself
to the assertion of the girl of seventeen, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should never be
happy again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense: perhaps in ten years' time you will be looking back on
this trial as a very light one--who knows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay it seems foolish; perhaps all our earthly trials will
appear foolish to us after a while; perhaps they seem so now to
angels. But we are ourselves, you know, and this is _now_, not some
time to come, a long, long way off. And we are not angels, to be
comforted by seeing the ends for which everything is sent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never spoken so long a sentence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) before; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had said it, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), as they
stood steadily looking at each other, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blushed a little; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could
not have told why. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tell himself why a sudden pleasure came
over him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) simple expressive face--and for a moment
lost the sense of what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was saying, in the sensation of pity for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sad earnestness. In an instant more he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was himself again. Only
it is pleasant to the wisest, most reasonable youth of one or two
and twenty to find himself looked up to as a Mentor by a girl of
seventeen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, I understand. Yes: it is _now_ we have to do with. Don't let
us go into metaphysics.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes wide at this. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
been talking metaphysics without knowing it? <div class="bookquote">``One looks forward to
a mass of trials, which will only have to be encountered one by one,
little by little. Oh, here is my mother! she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will tell you better
than I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a trio</b></font>)</div><p/>And the _tête-à-tête_ was merged in a trio. Mrs. Hamley lay down; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
had not been well all day--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had missed Molly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) said,--and now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) wanted to hear of all the adventures that had occurred to the
girl at the Towers. Molly sate on a stool close to the head of the
sofa, and Roger, though at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) took up a book and tried to read
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might be no restraint, soon found his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) reading all a pretence:
it was so interesting to listen to Molly's little narrative, and,
besides, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) any help in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) time of need, was it
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) duty to make himself acquainted with all the circumstances of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) case?

<p/>And so they went on during all the remaining time of Molly's stay
at Hamley. Mrs. Hamley sympathized, and liked to hear details; as
the French say, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sympathy was given _en détail_, the Squire's
_en gros_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was very sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) evident grief, and almost felt
guilty, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had had a share in bringing it about, by the mention
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had made of the possibility of Mr. Gibson's marrying again, when
first Molly came on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) visit to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife more than
once,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Pon my word, now, I wish I'd never spoken those unlucky words that
first day at dinner. Do you remember how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took them up? It was
like a prophecy of what was to come, now, wasn't it? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked
pale from that day, and I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has ever fairly enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
food since. I must take more care what I say for the future. Not but
what Gibson is doing the very best thing, both for himself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>),
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) can do. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) so only yesterday. But I'm very sorry for
the little girl, though. I wish I'd never spoken about it, that I do!
but it was like a prophecy, wasn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger tried hard to find out a reasonable and right method of
comfort, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) way, was sorry for the girl, who bravely
struggled to be cheerful, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own private grief, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
mother's sake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt as if high principle and noble precept ought
to perform an immediate work. But they do not, for there is always
the unknown quantity of individual experience and feeling, which
offer a tacit resistance, the amount incalculable by another, to all
good counsel and high decree. But the bond between the Mentor and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>)
Telemachus strengthened every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) endeavoured to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out
of morbid thought into interest in other than personal things; and,
naturally enough, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) own objects of interest came readiest to hand.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know why or how; but after
a talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had got the clue to
goodness and peace, whatever befell.




<p/>CHAPTER XII.

<p/>PREPARING FOR THE WEDDING.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>Meanwhile the love-affairs between the middle-aged couple were
prospering well, after a fashion; after the fashion that they liked
best, although it might probably have appeared dull and prosaic to
younger people. Lord Cumnor had come down in great glee at the news
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wife at the Towers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), too, seemed to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
had taken an active part in bringing about the match by only speaking
about it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) first words on the subject to Lady Cumnor were,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you so. Now didn't I say what a good, suitable thing this
affair between Gibson and Clare would be! I don't know when I've been
so much pleased. You may despise the trade of match-maker, my lady,
but I am very proud of it. After this, I shall go on looking out
for suitable cases among the middle-aged people of my acquaintance.
I shan't meddle with young folks, they are so apt to be fanciful;
but I've been so successful in this, that I do think it's good
encouragement to go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on--with what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Cumnor, drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, planning,--you can't deny that I planned this match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you are likely to do either much good or harm by
planning,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) replied, with cool, good sense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It puts it into people's heads, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you speak about your plans to them, of course it does. But
in this case you never spoke to either Mr. Gibson or Clare, did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Miss Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>All at once the recollection of how Clare had come upon the passage
in Lord Cumnor's letter flashed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) lady, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not say
anything about it, but left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband to flounder about as best he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
might.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I never spoke to them; of course not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must be strongly mesmeric, and your will acted upon theirs,
if you are to take credit for any part in the affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
pitiless wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really can't say. It's no use looking back to what I said or
did. I'm very well satisfied with it, and that's enough, and I mean
to show them how much I'm pleased. I shall give Clare something
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) rigging out, and they shall have a breakfast at Ashcombe
Manor-house. I'll write to Preston about it. When did you say they
were to be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they'd better wait till Christmas, and I have told them so.
It would amuse the children, going over to Ashcombe for the wedding;
and if it's bad weather during the holidays I'm always afraid of
their finding it dull at the Towers. It's very different if it's a
good frost, and they can go out skating and sledging in the park. But
these last two years it has been so wet for them, poor dears!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And will the other poor dears be content to wait to make a holiday
for your grandchildren? ``To make a Roman holiday.'' Pope, or somebody
else, has a line of poetry like that. <div class="bookquote">``To make a Roman holiday,''' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>)
repeated, pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) unusual aptitude at quotation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Byron, and it's nothing to do with the subject in hand. I'm
surprised at your lordship's quoting Byron,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) was a very immoral
poet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) take his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) oaths in the House of Lords,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lord Cumnor,
apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! the less said about him (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor. <div class="bookquote">``I have
told Clare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had better not think of being married before
Christmas: and it won't do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) school in a hurry
either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Miss Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>But Clare did not intend to wait till Christmas; and for this once
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) point against the will of the countess, and without
many words, or any open opposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had a harder task in setting
aside Mr. Gibson's desire to have Cynthia over for the wedding,
even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) school at Boulogne directly after the
ceremony. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had said that it would be delightful, a
charming plan; only she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) must give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own wishes
to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) child near her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) at such a time, on account of the expense
of the double journey.

<p/>But Mr. Gibson, economical as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) habitual expenditure,
had a really generous heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had already shown it, in entirely
relinquishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) future wife's life-interest in the very small
property the late Mr. Kirkpatrick had left, in favour of Cynthia;
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) arranged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) should come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) home as a daughter as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) left the school she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was at. The life-interest was about
thirty pounds a year. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) gave Mrs. Kirkpatrick three five-pound
notes, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) hoped they would do away with the objections
to Cynthia's coming over to the wedding; and at the time Mrs.
Kirkpatrick felt as if they would, and caught the reflection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
strong wish, and fancied it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) own. If the letter could have
been written and the money sent off that day while the reflected
glow of affection lasted, Cynthia would have been bridesmaid to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother. But a hundred little interruptions came in the way of
letter-writing; and by the next day maternal love had diminished;
and the value affixed to the money had increased: money had been
so much needed, so hardly earned in Mrs. Kirkpatrick's life; while
the perhaps necessary separation of mother and child had lessened
the amount of affection the former had to bestow. So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) persuaded
herself, afresh, that it would be unwise to disturb Cynthia at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
studies; to interrupt the fulfilment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) duties just after the
_semestre_ had begun afresh; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) wrote a letter to Madame Lefevre
so well imbued with this persuasion, that an answer which was almost
an echo of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) words was returned, the sense of which being conveyed
to Mr. Gibson, who was no great French scholar, settled the vexed
question, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) moderate but unfeigned regret. But the fifteen
pounds were not returned. Indeed, not merely that sum, but a
great part of the hundred which Lord Cumnor had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
trousseau, was required to pay off debts at Ashcombe; for the school
had been anything but flourishing since Mrs. Kirkpatrick had had it.
It was really very much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) credit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) preferred clearing
herself from debt to purchasing wedding finery. But it was one of the
few points to be respected in Mrs. Kirkpatrick that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had always
been careful in payment to the shops where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) dealt; it was a little
sense of duty cropping out. Whatever other faults might arise from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) superficial and flimsy character, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was always uneasy till she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
was out of debt. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had no scruple in appropriating her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) future
husband's money to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) own use, when it was decided that it was not
to be employed as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) intended. What new articles she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) bought for
herself, were all such as would make a show, and an impression upon
the ladies of Hollingford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) argued with herself that linen, and
all under-clothing, would never be seen; while she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) knew that every
gown she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had, would give rise to much discussion, and would be
counted up in the little town.

<p/>So her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) stock of underclothing was very small, and scarcely any of it
new; but it was made of dainty material, and was finely mended up
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) deft fingers, many a night long after her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) pupils were in bed;
inwardly resolving all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) sewed, that hereafter some one
else should do her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) plain-work. Indeed, many a little circumstance of
former subjection to the will of others rose up before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) during
these quiet hours, as an endurance or a suffering never to occur
again. So apt are people to look forward to a different kind of life
from that to which they have been accustomed, as being free from care
and trial! She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) recollected how, one time during this very summer at
the Towers, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was engaged to Mr. Gibson, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had taken
above an hour to arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) hair in some new mode carefully studied
from Mrs. Bradley's fashion-book--after all, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) came down,
looking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) very best, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) thought, and ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) lover, Lady
Cumnor had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) back again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) room, just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had been
a little child, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) hair over again, and not to make such a
figure of fun of herself! Another time she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had been sent to change
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) gown for one in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) opinion far less becoming, but which suited
Lady Cumnor's taste better. These were little things; but they were
late samples of what in different shapes she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had had to endure for
many years; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) liking for Mr. Gibson grew in proportion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
sense of the evils from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was going to serve as a means of
escape. After all, that interval of hope and plain-sewing, intermixed
though it was with tuition, was not disagreeable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wedding-dress
was secure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) former pupils at the Towers were going to present her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
with that; they were to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) from head to foot on the auspicious
day. Lord Cumnor, as has been said, had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) a hundred pounds
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) trousseau, and had sent Mr. Preston a carte-blanche order for
the wedding-breakfast in the old hall in Ashcombe Manor-house. Lady
Cumnor--a little put out by the marriage not being deferred till
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) grandchildren's Christmas holidays--had nevertheless given Mrs.
Kirkpatrick an excellent English-made watch and chain; more clumsy
but more serviceable than the little foreign elegance that had hung
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) side so long, and misled her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) so often.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) preparations were thus in a very considerable state of
forwardness, while Mr. Gibson had done nothing as yet towards any new
arrangement or decoration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) house for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) intended bride. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ought to do something. But what? Where to begin, when so much
was out of order, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had so little time for superintendence?
At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came to the wise decision of asking one of the Miss
Brownings, for old friendship's sake, to take the trouble of
preparing what was immediately requisite; and resolved to leave all
the more ornamental decorations that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) proposed, to the taste of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
future wife. But before making his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) request to the Miss Brownings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
had to tell them of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) engagement, which had hitherto been kept a
secret from the townspeople, who had set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) frequent visits
at the Towers to the score of the countess's health. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
should have laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sleeve at any middle-aged widower who
came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with a confession of the kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had now to make to Miss
Brownings, and disliked the idea of the necessary call: but it was to
be done, so one evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went in <div class="bookquote">``promiscuous,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as they called it,
and told them his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) story. At the end of the first chapter--that is to
say, at the end of the story of Mr. Coxe's calf-love, Miss Browning
held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) hands in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think of Molly, as I have held in long-clothes, coming to have a
lover! Well, to be sure! Sister Phoebe--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) was just coming into
the room-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``here's a piece of news! Molly Gibson has got a lover!
One may almost say she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s had an offer! Mr. Gibson, may not one?--and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s but sixteen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seventeen, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe, who piqued herself on
knowing all about dear Mr. Gibson's domestic affairs. <div class="bookquote">``Seventeen, the
22nd of last June.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have it your own way. Seventeen, if you like to call her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``The fact is still the same--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s
got a lover; and it seems to me she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was in long-clothes only
yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I hope her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) course of true love will run smooth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Phoebe.

<p/>Now Mr. Gibson came in; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) story was not half told, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
did not want them to run away too far with the idea of Molly's
love-affair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly knows nothing about it. I haven't even named it to any one
but you two, and to one other friend. I trounced Coxe well, and did
my best to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) attachment--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) calls it--in bounds. But I
was sadly puzzled what to do about Molly. Miss Eyre was away, and I
couldn't leave them in the house together without any older woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Gibson! why did you not send her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>broke in Miss
Browning. <div class="bookquote">``We would have done anything in our power for you; for your
sake, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor dear mother's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. I know you would, but it wouldn't have done to have had
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in Hollingford, just at the time of Coxe's effervescence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>)'s
better now. His (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) appetite has come back with double force, after the
fasting he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) thought it right to exhibit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) had three helpings of
black-currant dumpling yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you are most liberal, Mr. Gibson. Three helpings! And, I
daresay, butcher's meat in proportion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I only named it because, with such very young men, it's
generally see-saw between appetite and love, and I thought the third
helping a very good sign. But still, you know, what has happened
once, may happen again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Phoebe had an offer of marriage once--''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! sister. It might hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) feelings to have it spoken about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, child! It's five-and-twenty years ago; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eldest
daughter is married herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I own he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) has not been constant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>pleaded Miss Phoebe, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) tender, piping voice. <div class="bookquote">``All men are not--like you, Mr.
Gibson--faithful to the memory of their first-love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson winced. Jeannie was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) first love; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannie</b></font>) name had never
been breathed in Hollingford. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife--good, pretty, sensible, and
beloved as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been--was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) second; no, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) third love.
And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was come to make a confidence about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) second marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``at any rate, I thought I must do something to
protect Molly from such affairs while she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was so young, and before I
had given my sanction. Miss Eyre's little nephew fell ill of scarlet
fever--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! by-the-by, how careless of me not to inquire. How is the poor
little fellow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse--better. It doesn't signify to what I've got to say now; the
fact was, Miss Eyre couldn't come back to my house for some time, and
I cannot leave Molly altogether at Hamley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I see now, why there was that sudden visit to Hamley. Upon my
word, it's quite a romance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like hearing of a love-affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>murmured Miss Phoebe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then if you'll let me get on with my story, you shall hear of mine,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, quite beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) patience with their constant
interruptions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe, faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us and save us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, with less sentiment in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) tone; <div class="bookquote">``what next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My marriage, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, choosing to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)
expression of intense surprise literally. <div class="bookquote">``And that's what I came to
speak to you about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>A little hope darted up in Miss Phoebe's breast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) had often said
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister, in the confidence of curling-time -LRB-ladies wore curls
in those days-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``that the only man who could ever bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to think
of matrimony was Mr. Gibson; but that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ever proposed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
should feel bound to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), for poor dear Mary's sake;''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>never
explaining what exact style of satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) imagined she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) should
give to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) dead friend by marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) late husband. Phoebe played
nervously with the strings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) black silk apron. Like the Caliph
in the Eastern story, a whole lifetime of possibilities passed
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) mind in an instant, of which possibilities the question
of questions was, Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister? Attend, Phoebe, to
the present moment, and listen to what is being said before you
distress yourself with a perplexity which will never arise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it has been an anxious thing for me to decide who I should
ask to be the mistress of my family, the mother of my girl; but I
think I've decided rightly at last. The lady I have chosen--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell us at once who she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is, there's a good man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said
straight-forward Miss Browning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Kirkpatrick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bridegroom</b></font>)</div>said the bridegroom elect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! the governess at the Towers, that the countess makes so much
of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is much valued by them--and deservedly so. She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) keeps a
school now at Ashcombe, and is accustomed to housekeeping. She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) has
brought up the young ladies at the Towers, and has a daughter of her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>)
own, therefore it is probable she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) will have a kind, motherly feeling
towards Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s a very elegant-looking woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe, feeling it
incumbent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) to say something laudatory, by way of concealing
the thoughts that had just been passing through her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``I've seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in the carriage, riding backwards with the countess: a very
pretty woman, I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning. <div class="bookquote">``What has her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) elegance or
prettiness to do with the affair? Did you ever know a widower marry
again for such trifles as those? It's always from a sense of duty of
one kind or another--isn't it, Mr. Gibson? They want a housekeeper;
or they want a mother for their children; or they think their last
wife would have liked it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps the thought had passed through the elder sister's mind that
Phoebe might have been chosen, for there was a sharp acrimony in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) tone; not unfamiliar to Mr. Gibson, but with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not
choose to cope at this present moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have it your own way, Miss Browning. Settle my motives for
me. I don't pretend to be quite clear about them myself. But I am
clear in wishing heartily to keep my old friends, and for them to
love my future wife for my sake. I don't know any two women in the
world, except Molly and Mrs. Kirkpatrick, I regard as much as I do
you. Besides, I want to ask you if you will let Molly come and stay
with you till after my marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have asked us before you asked Madam Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning, only half mollified. <div class="bookquote">``We are your old friends; and we were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's friends, too; though we are not county folk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's unjust,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``And you know it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. You are always with Lord Hollingford, when you can
get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>), much more than you ever are with Mr. Goodenough, or Mr.
Smith. And you are always going over to Hamley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Browning was not one to give in all at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I seek Lord Hollingford as I should seek such a man, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>)
rank or position might be: usher to a school, carpenter, shoemaker,
if it were possible for them to have had a similar character of mind
developed by similar advantages. Mr. Goodenough is a very clever
attorney, with strong local interests and not a thought beyond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, don't go on arguing, it always gives me a headache, as
Phoebe knows. I didn't mean what I said, that's enough, isn't it?
I'll retract anything sooner than be reasoned with. Where were we
before you began your arguments?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About dear little Molly coming to pay us a visit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Phoebe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have asked you at first, only Coxe was so rampant with his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>)
love. I didn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) might do, or how troublesome he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) might be
both to Molly and you. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) has cooled down now. Absence has had
a very tranquillizing effect, and I think Molly may be in the same
town with him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>), without any consequences beyond a few sighs every time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) mind by meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). And I've got another favour
to ask of you, so you see it would never do for me to argue with you,
Miss Browning, when I ought to be a humble suppliant. Something must
be done to the house to make it all ready for the future Mrs. Gibson.
It wants painting and papering shamefully, and I should think some
new furniture, but I'm sure I don't know what. Would you be so very
kind as to look over the place, and see how far a hundred pounds
will go? The dining-room walls must be painted; we'll keep the
drawing-room paper for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) choice, and I've a little spare money for
that room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to lay out; but all the rest of the house I'll
leave to you, if you'll only be kind enough to help an old friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a commission which exactly gratified Miss Browning's love
of power. The disposal of money involved patronage of trades people,
such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) had exercised in her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) father's lifetime, but had had very
little chance of showing since his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) usual good-humour was
quite restored by this proof of confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) taste and economy,
while Miss Phoebe's imagination dwelt rather on the pleasure of a
visit from Molly.




<p/>CHAPTER XIII.

<p/>MOLLY GIBSON``S NEW FRIENDS.


<p/>Time was speeding on; it was now the middle of August,--if anything
was to be done to the house, it must be done at once. Indeed, in
several ways Mr. Gibson's arrangements with Miss Browning had not
been made too soon. The squire had heard that Osborne might probably
return home for a few days before going abroad; and, though the
growing intimacy between Roger and Molly did not alarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in the
least, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was possessed by a very hearty panic lest the heir
might take a fancy to the surgeon's daughter; and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was in such a
fidget for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to leave the house before Osborne came home, that his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
wife lived in constant terror lest he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) should make it too obvious to
their visitor.

<p/>Every young girl of seventeen or so, who is at all thoughtful, is
very apt to make a Pope out of the first person who presents to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a new or larger system of duty than that by which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been
unconsciously guided hitherto. Such a Pope was Roger to Molly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
looked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) opinion, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) authority on almost every subject, yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) had only said one or two things in a terse manner which gave them
the force of precepts--stable guides to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) conduct--and had shown
the natural superiority in wisdom and knowledge which is sure to
exist between a highly educated young man of no common intelligence,
and an ignorant girl of seventeen, who yet was well capable of
appreciation. Still, although they were drawn together in this very
pleasant relationship, each was imagining some one very different for
the future owner of their whole heart--their highest and completest
love. Roger looked to find a grand woman, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) equal, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) empress;
beautiful in person, serene in wisdom, ready for counsel, as was
Egeria. Molly's little wavering maiden fancy dwelt on the unseen
Osborne, who was now a troubadour, and now a knight, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wrote
about in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own poems; some one like Osborne, perhaps, rather
than Osborne himself, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) shrank from giving a personal form
and name to the hero that was to be. The squire was not unwise in
wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) well out of the house before Osborne came home, if he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was
considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) peace of mind. Yet, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) went away from the hall
he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) constantly; it had been so pleasant to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) there
fulfilling all the pretty offices of a daughter; cheering the meals,
so often tête-à-tête betwixt him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) and Roger, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) innocent wise
questions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) lively interest in their talk, her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) merry replies to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) banter.

<p/>And Roger missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) too. Sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) remarks had probed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
mind, and excited him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to the deep thought in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) delighted; at
other times he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had felt himself of real help to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) hours of
need, and in making her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) take an interest in books, which treated of
higher things than the continual fiction and poetry which she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had
hitherto read. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt something like an affectionate tutor suddenly
deprived of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) most promising pupil; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) would go
on without him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) would be puzzled and disheartened by the
books he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) to read; how she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) stepmother would get
along together? She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thoughts a good deal those first
few days after she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) left the hall. Mrs. Hamley regretted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) more,
and longer than did the other two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) the place of
a daughter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) heart; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) missed the sweet feminine
companionship, the playful caresses, the never-ceasing attentions;
the very need of sympathy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sorrows, that Molly had shown so
openly from time to time; all these things had extremely endeared her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
to the tender-hearted Mrs. Hamley.

<p/>Molly, too, felt the change of atmosphere keenly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) blamed
herself for so feeling even more keenly still. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not
help having a sense of refinement, which had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) appreciate the
whole manner of being at the Hall. By her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dear old friends the Miss
Brownings she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was petted and caressed so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) became ashamed
of noticing the coarser and louder tones in which they spoke, the
provincialism of their pronunciation, the absence of interest in
things, and their greediness of details about persons. They asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
questions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was puzzled enough to answer about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) future
stepmother; her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) loyalty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father forbidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to reply fully
and truthfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was always glad when they began to make inquiries
as to every possible affair at the Hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been so happy there;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had liked them all, down to the very dogs, so thoroughly, that it
was easy work replying: she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not mind telling them everything,
even to the style of Mrs. Hamley's invalid dress; nor what wine the
squire drank at dinner. Indeed, talking about these things helped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to recall the happiest time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) life. But one evening, as
they were all sitting together after tea in the little upstairs
drawing-room, looking into the High Street--Molly discoursing away on
the various pleasures of Hamley Hall, and just then telling of all
Roger's wisdom in natural science, and some of the curiosities he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had
shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was suddenly pulled up by this little speech,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to have seen a great deal of Mr. Roger, Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning, in a way intended to convey a great deal of meaning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)
sister and none at all to Molly. But--

<p/>The man recovered of the bite;
The dog it was that died.

<p/>Molly was perfectly aware of Miss Browning's emphatic tone, though at
first she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was perplexed as to its cause; while Miss Phoebe was just
then too much absorbed in knitting the heel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) stocking to be
fully alive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister's nods and winks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was very kind to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, slowly, pondering over
Miss Browning's manner, and unwilling to say more until she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
satisfied herself to what the question tended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay you will soon be going to Hamley Hall again? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>)'s not
the eldest son, you know, Phoebe! Don't make my head ache with your
eternal `eighteen, nineteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>but attend to the conversation. Molly
is telling us how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw of Mr. Roger, and how kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). I've always heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was a very nice young man, my dear. Tell
us some more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)! Now, Phoebe, attend! How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) kind to you,
Molly?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) told me what books to read; and one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) made me notice how
many bees I saw--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bees, child! What do you mean? Either you or he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) must have been
crazy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not at all. There are more than two hundred kinds of bees in
England, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) wanted me to notice the difference between them and
flies. Miss Browning, I can't help seeing what you fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said
Molly, as red as fire, <div class="bookquote">``but it is very wrong; it is all a mistake. I
won't speak another word about Mr. Roger or Hamley at all, if it puts
such silly notions into your head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Highty-tighty! Here's a young lady to be lecturing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elders! Silly
notions indeed! They are in your head, it seems. And let me tell you,
Molly, you are too young to let your mind be running on lovers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had been once or twice called saucy and impertinent, and
certainly a little sauciness came out now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said what the `silly notion' was, Miss Browning; did I now,
Miss Phoebe? Don't you see, dear Miss Phoebe, it is all her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) own
interpretation, and according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) own fancy, this foolish talk
about lovers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was flaming with indignation; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had appealed to the
wrong person for justice. Miss Phoebe tried to make peace after the
fashion of weak-minded people, who would cover over the unpleasant
sight of a sore, instead of trying to heal it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't know anything about it, my dear. It seems to me
that what Dorothy was saying was very true--very true indeed; and I
think, love, you misunderstood her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>); or, perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) misunderstood
you; or I may be misunderstanding it altogether; so we'd better not
talk any more about it. What price did you say you were going to give
for the drugget in Mr. Gibson's dining-room, sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>So Miss Browning and Molly went on till evening, each chafed and
angry with the other. They wished each other good-night, going
through the usual forms in the coolest manner possible. Molly went
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) little bedroom, clean and neat as a bedroom could be, with
draperies of small delicate patchwork--bed-curtains, window-curtains,
and counterpane; a japanned toilette-table, full of little boxes,
with a small looking-glass affixed to it, that distorted every face
that was so unwise as to look in it. This room had been to the child
one of the most dainty and luxurious places ever seen, in comparison
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own bare, white-dimity bedroom; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sleeping in
it, as a guest, and all the quaint adornments she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had once peeped at
as a great favour, as they were carefully wrapped up in cap-paper,
were set out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) use. And yet how little she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had deserved this
hospitable care; how impertinent she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been; how cross she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had felt
ever since! She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was crying tears of penitence and youthful misery
when there came a low tap to the door. Molly opened it, and there
stood Miss Browning, in a wonderful erection of a nightcap, and
scantily attired in a coloured calico jacket over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) scrimpy and
short white petticoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you were asleep, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), coming in and
shutting the door. <div class="bookquote">``But I wanted to say to you we've got wrong
to-day, somehow; and I think it was perhaps my doing. It's as well
Phoebe shouldn't know, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) thinks me perfect; and when there's
only two of us, we get along better if one of us thinks the other
can do no wrong. But I rather think I was a little cross. We'll not
say any more about it, Molly; only we'll go to sleep friends,--and
friends we'll always be, child, won't we? Now give me a kiss,
and don't cry and swell your eyes up;--and put out your candle
carefully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wrong--it was my fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiddlestick-ends! Don't contradict me! I say it was my fault, and
I won't hear another word about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day Molly went with Miss Browning to see the changes going
on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's house. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) they were but dismal improvements.
The faint grey of the dining-room walls, which had harmonized well
enough with the deep crimson of the moreen curtains, and which
when well cleaned looked thinly coated rather than dirty, was now
exchanged for a pink salmon-colour of a very glowing hue; and the
new curtains were of that pale sea-green just coming into fashion.
<div class="bookquote">``Very bright and pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>Miss Browning called it; and in the first
renewing of their love Molly could not bear to contradict her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
could only hope that the green and brown drugget would tone down the
brightness and prettiness. There was scaffolding here, scaffolding
there, and Betty scolding everywhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come up now, and see your papa's bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s sleeping upstairs in
yours, that everything may be done up afresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly could just remember, in faint clear lines of distinctness, the
being taken into this very room to bid farewell to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dying mother.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could see the white linen, the white muslin, surrounding the
pale, wan wistful face, with the large, longing eyes, yearning for
one more touch of the little soft warm child, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was too feeble
to clasp in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms, already growing numb in death. Many a time when
Molly had been in this room since that sad day, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) seen in vivid
fancy that same wan wistful face lying on the pillow, the outline
of the form beneath the clothes; and the girl had not shrunk from
such visions, but rather cherished them, as preserving to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the
remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's outward semblance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes were full of
tears, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) followed Miss Browning into this room to see it under
its new aspect. Nearly everything was changed--the position of the
bed and the colour of the furniture; there was a grand toilette-table
now, with a glass upon it, instead of the primitive substitute of the
top of a chest of drawers, with a mirror above upon the wall, sloping
downwards; these latter things had served her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother during her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) short
married life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, we must have all in order for a lady who has passed so
much of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) time in the countess's mansion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, who
was now quite reconciled to the marriage, thanks to the pleasant
employment of furnishing that had devolved upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) in consequence.
``Cromer, the upholsterer, wanted to persuade me to have a sofa and a
writing-table. These men will say anything is the fashion, if they
want to sell an article. I said, ``No, no, Cromer: bedrooms are for
sleeping in, and sitting-rooms are for sitting in. Keep everything to
its right purpose, and don't try and delude me into nonsense.<div class="bookquote">'' Why,
my mother would have given us a fine scolding if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had ever caught
us in our bedrooms in the daytime. We kept our out-door things in
a closet downstairs; and there was a very tidy place for washing
our hands, which is as much as one wants in the daytime. Stuffing
up a bedroom with sofas and tables! I never heard of such a thing.
Besides, a hundred pounds won't last for ever. I sha'n't be able to
do anything for your room, Molly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm right down glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Nearly everything in it was
what mamma had when she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) lived with my great-uncle. I wouldn't have
had it changed for the world; I am so fond of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's no danger of it, now the money is run out. By the way,
Molly, who's to buy you a bridesmaid's dress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am to be a bridesmaid; but
no one has spoken to me about my dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall ask your papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, don't. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must have to spend a great deal of money just now.
Besides, I would rather not be at the wedding, if they'll let me stay
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, child. Why, all the town would be talking of it. You must
go, and you must be well dressed, for your father's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Gibson had thought of Molly's dress, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had said
nothing about it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had commissioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) future wife to get
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) what was requisite; and presently a very smart dressmaker came
over from the county-town to try on a dress, which was both so simple
and so elegant as at once to charm Molly. When it came home all ready
to put on, Molly had a private dressing-up for the Miss Brownings'
benefit; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was almost startled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked into the glass,
and saw the improvement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) appearance. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder if I'm pretty,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). ``I almost think I am--in this kind of dress I mean, of
course. Betty would say, <div class="bookquote">``Fine feathers make fine birds.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went downstairs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bridal attire, and with shy blushes
presented herself for inspection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was greeted with a burst of
admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, upon my word! I shouldn't have known you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Fine feathers,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>thought Molly, and checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) rising vanity.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are really beautiful--isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>), sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear, if you were always dressed, you would be prettier than
your dear mamma, whom we always reckoned so very personable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not a bit like her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>). You favour your father, and white always
sets off a brown complexion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) beautiful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>persevered Miss Phoebe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) is, Providence made her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>), and not she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) herself.
Besides, the dressmaker must go shares. What a fine India muslin it
is! it'll have cost a pretty penny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson and Molly drove over to Ashcombe, the night before the
wedding, in the one yellow post-chaise that Hollingford possessed.
They were to be Mr. Preston's, or, rather, my lord's guests at the
Manor-house. The Manor-house came up to its name, and delighted Molly
at first sight. It was built of stone, had many gables and mullioned
windows, and was covered over with Virginian creeper and late-blowing
roses. Molly did not know Mr. Preston, who stood in the doorway
to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took standing with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as a young lady
at once, and it was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had met with the kind of
behaviour--half complimentary, half flirting--which some men think
it necessary to assume with every woman under five-and-twenty. Mr.
Preston was very handsome, and knew it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was a fair man, with
light-brown hair and whiskers; grey, roving, well-shaped eyes, with
lashes darker than his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) hair; and a figure rendered easy and supple by
the athletic exercises in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) excellence was famous, and which
had procured him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) admission into much higher society than he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was
otherwise entitled to enter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was a capital cricketer; was so good
a shot, that any house desirous of reputation for its bags on the
12th or the 1st, was glad to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) for a guest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) taught young
ladies to play billiards on a wet day, or went in for the game in
serious earnest when required. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) knew half the private theatrical
plays off by heart, and was invaluable in arranging impromptu
charades and tableaux. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) own private reasons for wishing
to get up a flirtation with Molly just at this time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had amused
himself so much with the widow when she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) first came to Ashcombe, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) fancied that the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) less polished, less
handsome, middle-aged husband, might be too much of a contrast to be
agreeable. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had really a strong passion for some one else;
some one who would be absent; and that passion it was necessary for
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to conceal. So that, altogether, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had resolved, even had <div class="bookquote">``the
little Gibson-girl''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)-RRB- been less attractive than she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
was, to devote himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) for the next sixteen hours.

<p/>They were taken by their host into a wainscoted parlour, where a
wood fire crackled and burnt, and the crimson curtains shut out the
waning day and the outer chill. Here the table was laid for dinner;
snowy table-linen, bright silver, clear sparkling glass, wine and an
autumnal dessert on the sideboard. Yet Mr. Preston kept apologizing
to Molly for the rudeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) bachelor home, for the smallness of
the room, the great dining-room being already appropriated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
housekeeper, in preparation for the morrow's breakfast. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
rang for a servant to show Molly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was taken into a
most comfortable chamber; a wood fire on the hearth, candles lighted
on the toilette-table, dark woollen curtains surrounding a snow-white
bed, great vases of china standing here and there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my Lady Harriet's room when her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ladyship comes to the
Manor-house with my lord the earl,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>said the housemaid, striking
out thousands of brilliant sparks by a well-directed blow at a
smouldering log. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I help you to dress, miss? I always helps her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
ladyship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly, quite aware of the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) white muslin gown
for the wedding besides that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had on, dismissed the good woman,
and was thankful to be left to herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dinner''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was it called? Why, it was nearly eight o'clock; and
preparations for bed seemed a more natural employment than dressing
at this hour of night. All the dressing she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could manage was the
placing of a red damask rose or two in the band of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) grey stuff
gown, there being a great nosegay of choice autumnal flowers on the
toilette-table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did try the effect of another crimson rose in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) black hair, just above her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ear; it was very pretty, but too
coquettish, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) put it back again. The dark-oak panels and
wainscoting of the whole house seemed to glow in warm light; there
were so many fires in different rooms, in the hall, and even one on
the landing of the staircase. Mr. Preston must have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) step,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in the hall, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) into a small drawing-room,
with closed folding-doors on one side, opening into the larger
drawing-room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). This room into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) entered
reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a little of Hamley--yellow-satin upholstery of seventy
or a hundred years ago, all delicately kept and scrupulously clean;
great Indian cabinets, and china jars, emitting spicy odours; a large
blazing fire, before which her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) morning dress,
grave and thoughtful, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been all day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This room is that which Lady Harriet uses when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) comes here with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father for a day or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Preston. And Molly tried to
save her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father by being ready to talk herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) often come here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not often. But I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) likes being here when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does. Perhaps
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) finds it an agreeable change after the more formal life she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) leads
at the Towers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it was a very pleasant house to stay at,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly,
remembering the look of warm comfort that pervaded it. But a little
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dismay Mr. Preston seemed to take it as a compliment to
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid a young lady like you might perceive all the
incongruities of a bachelor's home. I'm very much obliged to you,
Miss Gibson. In general I live pretty much in the room in which we
shall dine; and I've a sort of agent's office in which I keep books
and papers, and receive callers on business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they went in to dinner. Molly thought everything that was served
was delicious, and cooked to the point of perfection; but they
did not seem to satisfy Mr. Preston, who apologized to his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) guests
several times for the bad cooking of this dish, or the omission
of a particular sauce to that; always referring to bachelor's
housekeeping, bachelor's this and bachelor's that, till Molly grew
quite impatient at the word. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's depression, which was still
continuing and rendering him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) very silent, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) uneasy; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
wished to conceal it from Mr. Preston; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) talked away, trying
to obviate the sort of personal bearing which their host would give
to everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not know when to leave the gentlemen, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father made a sign to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was conducted back to the yellow
drawing-room by Mr. Preston, who made many apologies for leaving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) there alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) enjoyed herself extremely, however, feeling at
liberty to prowl about, and examine all the curiosities the room
contained. Among other things was a Louis Quinze cabinet with lovely
miniatures in enamel let into the fine woodwork. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) carried a candle
to it, and was looking intently at these faces when her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father and
Mr. Preston came in. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father still looked care-worn and anxious;
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came up and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) on the back, looked at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was looking
at, and then went off to silence and the fire. Mr. Preston took the
candle out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand, and threw himself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) interests with an
air of ready gallantry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is said to be Mademoiselle de St. Quentin, a great beauty at
the French Court. This is Madame du Barri. Do you see any likeness in
Mademoiselle de St. Quentin to any one you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
voice a little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) asked this question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, looking at it again. <div class="bookquote">``I never saw any one half so
beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't you see a likeness--in the eyes particularly?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) asked
again, with some impatience.

<p/>Molly tried hard to find out a resemblance, and was again
unsuccessful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It constantly reminds me of--of Miss Kirkpatrick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! I am so glad--I've never seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), so of course I couldn't find out the likeness. You know her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>),
then, do you? Please tell me all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) hesitated a moment before speaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) smiled a little before
replying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'s very beautiful; that of course is understood when I say that
this miniature does not come up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) for beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And besides?--Go on, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by `besides'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'s very clever and accomplished?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>That was not in the least what Molly wanted to ask; but it was
difficult to word the vague vastness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) unspoken inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) is clever naturally; she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) has picked up accomplishments. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
has such a charm about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), one forgets what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) herself is in the
halo that surrounds her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>). You ask me all this, Miss Gibson, and I
answer truthfully; or else I should not entertain one young lady with
my enthusiastic praises of another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, if you wouldn't do it

in the year; yet I could travel in Iceland without wincing from the
cold.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIV.

<p/>MOLLY FINDS HERSELF PATRONIZED.


<p/>The wedding went off much as such affairs do. Lord Cumnor and Lady
Harriet drove over from the Towers, so the hour for the ceremony
was as late as possible. Lord Cumnor came in order to officiate as
the bride's father, and was in more open glee than either bride or
bridegroom, or any one else. Lady Harriet came as a sort of amateur
bridesmaid, to <div class="bookquote">``share Molly's duties,''  (<font color='red'><b>bridesmaid</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) called it. They went
from the Manor-house in two carriages to the church in the park, Mr.
Preston and Mr. Gibson in one, and Molly, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dismay, shut up with
Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet in the other. Lady Harriet's gown of
white muslin had seen one or two garden-parties, and was not in the
freshest order; it had been rather a freak of the young lady's at the
last moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very merry, and very much inclined to talk to
Molly, by way of finding out what sort of a little personage Clare
was to have for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) future daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) began:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We mustn't crush this pretty muslin dress of yours. Put it over
papa's knee; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) doesn't mind it in the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, my dear, a white dress!--no, to be sure not. I rather like
it. Besides, going to a wedding, who minds anything? It would be
different if we were going to a funeral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly conscientiously strove to find out the meaning of this speech;
but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had done so, Lady Harriet spoke again, going to the
point, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) always piqued herself on doing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay it's something of a trial to you, this second marriage of
your father's; but you'll find Clare the most amiable of women. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
always let me have my own way, and I've no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'ll let you have
yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to try and like her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in a low voice, striving
hard to keep down the tears that would keep rising to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes this
morning. <div class="bookquote">``I've seen very little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's the very best thing for you that could have happened, my
dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lord Cumnor. <div class="bookquote">``You're growing up into a young lady--and
a very pretty young lady, too, if you'll allow an old man to say
so--and who so proper as your father's wife to bring you out, and
show you off, and take you to balls, and that kind of thing? I
always said this match that is going to come off to-day was the most
suitable thing I ever knew; and it's even a better thing for you than
for the people themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, who had caught a sight of Molly's
troubled face, <div class="bookquote">``the thought of balls is too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) just now;
but you'll like having Cynthia Kirkpatrick for a companion, shan't
you, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, cheering up a little. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) over and over again when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was a little girl,
and once or twice since. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'s the prettiest creature that you ever
saw; and with eyes that mean mischief, if I'm not mistaken. But
Clare kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) spirit under pretty well when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was staying with
us,--afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) being troublesome, I fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Molly could shape her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) next question, they were at the church;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and Lady Harriet went into a pew near the door to wait for
the bride, in whose train they were to proceed to the altar. The earl
drove on alone to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) own house, not a quarter of a
mile distant. It was pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) to be led to the hymeneal altar
by a belted earl, and pleasant to have his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) daughter as a volunteer
bridesmaid. Mrs. Kirkpatrick in this flush of small gratifications,
and on the brink of matrimony with a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) liked, and who
would be bound to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) without any exertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) own, looked
beamingly happy and handsome. A little cloud came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) face at
the sight of Mr. Preston,--the sweet perpetuity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) smile was
rather disturbed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) followed in Mr. Gibson's wake. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) face
never changed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) gravely, and then seemed absorbed in
the service. Ten minutes, and all was over. The bride and bridegroom
were driving together to the Manor-house, Mr. Preston was walking
thither by a short cut, and Molly was again in the carriage with my
lord, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hands and chuckling, and Lady Harriet, trying to
be kind and consolatory, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) silence would have been the best
comfort.

<p/>Molly found out, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dismay, that the plan was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to return
with Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet when they went back to the Towers
in the evening. In the meantime Lord Cumnor had business to do with
Mr. Preston, and after the happy couple had driven off on their
week's holiday tour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was to be left alone with the formidable
Lady Harriet. When they were by themselves after all the others had
been thus disposed of, Lady Harriet sate still over the drawing-room
fire, holding a screen between it and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) face, but gazing intently
at Molly for a minute or two. Molly was fully conscious of this
prolonged look, and was trying to get up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) courage to return the
stare, when Lady Harriet suddenly said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like you;--you are a little wild creature, and I want to tame you.
Come here, and sit on this stool by me. What is your name? or what do
they call you?--as North-country people would express it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly Gibson. My real name is Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Molly is a nice, soft-sounding name. People in the last century
weren't afraid of homely names; now we are all so smart and fine: no
more <div class="bookquote">``Lady Bettys' now. I almost wonder they haven't re-christened
all the worsted and knitting-cotton that bears her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) name. Fancy Lady
Constantia's cotton, or Lady Anna-Maria's worsted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know there was a Lady Betty's cotton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That proves you don't do fancy-work! You'll find Clare will set
you to it, though. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) used to set me at piece after piece: knights
kneeling to ladies; impossible flowers. But I must do her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) the justice
to add that when I got tired of them she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) finished them herself. I
wonder how you'll get on together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>sighed out Molly, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to think I managed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), till one day an uncomfortable
suspicion arose that all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had been managing me. Still
it's easy work to let oneself be managed; at any rate till one wakens
up to the consciousness of the process, and then it may become
amusing, if one takes it in that light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hate to be managed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll try and
do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wishes for papa's sake, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'ll only tell me outright;
but I should dislike to be trapped into anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``am too lazy to avoid traps; and I rather
like to remark the cleverness with which they're set. But then,
of course, I know that if I choose to exert myself, I can break
through the withes of green flax with which they try to bind me. Now,
perhaps, you won't be able.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite understand what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/>``Oh, well--never mind; I daresay it's as well for you that you
shouldn't. The moral of all I have been saying is, ``Be a good girl,
and suffer yourself to be led, and you'll find your new stepmother
the sweetest creature imaginable.<div class="bookquote">'' You'll get on capitally with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
I make no doubt. How you'll get on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) daughter is another
affair; but I daresay very well. Now we'll ring for tea; for I
suppose that heavy breakfast is to stand for our lunch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Preston came into the room just at this time, and Molly was a
little surprised at Lady Harriet's cool manner of dismissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>),
remembering as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did how Mr. Preston had implied his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) intimacy with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ladyship the evening before at dinner-time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot bear that sort of person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, almost before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was out of hearing; <div class="bookquote">``giving himself airs of gallantry towards
one to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) simple respect is all his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) duty. I can talk to one
of my father's labourers with pleasure, while with a man like that
underbred fop I am all over thorns and nettles. What is it the Irish
call that style of creature? They've some capital word for it, I
know. What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I never heard it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, a little ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
ignorance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! that shows you've never read Miss Edgeworth's tales;--now,
have you? If you had, you'd have recollected that there was such
a word, even if you didn't remember what it was. If you've never
read those stories, they would be just the thing to beguile your
solitude--vastly improving and moral, and yet quite sufficiently
interesting. I'll lend them to you while you're all alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not alone. I'm not at home, but on a visit to Miss Brownings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll bring them to you. I know the Miss Brownings; they used
to come regularly on the school-day to the Towers. Pecksy and Flapsy
I used to call them. I like the Miss Brownings; one gets enough of
respect from them at any rate; and I've always wanted to see the
kind of _ménage_ of such people. I'll bring you a whole pile of Miss
Edgeworth's stories, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly sate quite silent for a minute or two; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mustered up
courage to speak out what was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the title was the firstfruits of the lesson, as
Molly took it, on paying due respect-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``your ladyship keeps speaking
of the sort of--the class of people to which I belong as if it was a
kind of strange animal you were talking about; yet you talk so openly
to me that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, go on--I like to hear you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Still silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think me in your heart a little impertinent--now, don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, almost kindly.

<p/>Molly held her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) peace for two or three moments; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
beautiful, honest eyes to Lady Harriet's face, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!--a little. But I think you a great many other things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>``We'll leave the `other things' for the present. Don't you see,
little one, I talk after my kind, just as you talk after your kind.
It's only on the surface with both of us. Why, I daresay some of your
good Hollingford ladies talk of the poor people in a manner which
they would consider as impertinent in their turn, if they could hear
it. But I ought to be more considerate when I remember how often
my blood has boiled at the modes of speech and behaviour of one of
my aunts, mamma's sister, Lady-- No! I won't name names. Any one
who earns his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) livelihood by any exercise of head or hands, from
professional people and rich merchants down to labourers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) calls
``persons.<div class="bookquote">'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) most slip-slop talk accord them
even the conventional title of `gentlemen;' and the way in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) takes possession of human beings, `my woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>`my people,<div class="bookquote">''--but,
after all, it is only a way of speaking. I ought not to have used
it to you; but somehow I separate you from all these Hollingford
people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>persevered Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are. But--now don't reprove me again for impertinence--most
of them are so unnatural in their exaggerated respect and admiration
when they come up to the Towers, and put on so much pretence by way
of fine manners, that they only make themselves objects of ridicule.
You at least are simple and truthful, and that's why I separate you
in my own mind from them, and have talked unconsciously to you as I
would--well! now here's another piece of impertinence--as I would to
my equal--in rank, I mean; for I don't set myself up in solid things
as any better than my neighbours. Here's tea, however, come in time
to stop me from growing too humble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a very pleasant little tea in the fading September twilight.

<p/>Just as it was ended, in came Mr. Preston again:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Harriet, will you allow me the pleasure of showing you some
alterations I have made in the flower-garden--in which I have tried
to consult your taste--before it grows dark?''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: UNWELCOME ATTENTIONS.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Preston. I will ride over with papa some day, and we
will see if we approve of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Preston's brow flushed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) affected not to perceive Lady
Harriet's haughtiness, and, turning to Molly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will not you come out, Miss Gibson, and see something of the
gardens? You haven't been out at all, I think, excepting to church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly did not like the idea of going out for a walk with only Mr.
Preston; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pined for a little fresh air, would have been glad
to see the gardens, and look at the Manor-house from different
aspects; and, besides this, much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) recoiled from Mr. Preston,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) under the repulse he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had just received.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was hesitating, and slowly tending towards consent, Lady
Harriet spoke,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot spare Miss Gibson. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would like to see the place, I
will bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) over some day myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had left the room, Lady Harriet said,--<div class="bookquote">``I daresay it's my own
lazy selfishness has kept you indoors all day against your will. But,
at any rate, you are not to go out walking with that man. I've an
instinctive aversion to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); not entirely instinctive either; it has
some foundation in fact; and I desire you don't allow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever to get
intimate with you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a very clever land-agent, and does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty
by papa, and I don't choose to be taken up for libel; but remember
what I say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the carriage came round, and after numberless last words from
the earl--who appeared to have put off every possible direction to
the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) stood, like an awkward Mercury, balancing himself
on the step of the carriage--they drove back to the Towers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you rather come in and dine with us--we should send you home,
of course--or go home straight?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Harriet of Molly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father had both been sleeping till they drew up at the bottom of
the flight of steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell the truth, now and evermore. Truth is generally amusing, if
it's nothing else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather go back to Miss Brownings' at once, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said
Molly, with a nightmare-like recollection of the last, the only
evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had spent at the Towers.

<p/>Lord Cumnor was standing on the steps, waiting to hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) daughter
out of the carriage. Lady Harriet stopped to kiss Molly on the
forehead, and to say,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall come some day soon, and bring you a load of Miss Edgeworth's
tales, and make further acquaintance with Pecksy and Flapsy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, taking hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You must not come--indeed you must not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I would rather not--because I think that I ought not to have
any one coming to see me who laughs at the friends I am staying with,
and calls them names.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly's heart beat very fast, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) meant
every word that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear little woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and
speaking quite gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry to have called them
names--very, very sorry to have hurt you. If I promise you to be
respectful to them in word and in deed--and in very thought, if I
can--you'll let me then, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I'd better go home at once; I shall only say wrong
things--and there's Lord Cumnor waiting all this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) alone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)'s very well amused hearing all the news of the day
from Brown. Then I shall come--under promise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So Molly drove off in solitary grandeur; and Miss Brownings' knocker
was loosened on its venerable hinges by the never-ending peal of Lord
Cumnor's footman.

<p/>They were full of welcome, full of curiosity. All through the long
day they had been missing their bright young visitor, and three or
four times in every hour they had been wondering and settling what
everybody was doing at that exact minute. What had become of Molly
during all the afternoon, had been a great perplexity to them; and
they were very much oppressed with a sense of the great honour she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had received in being allowed to spend so many hours alone with
Lady Harriet. They were, indeed, more excited by this one fact than
by all the details of the wedding, most of which they had known
of beforehand, and talked over with much perseverance during the
day. Molly began to feel as if there was some foundation for Lady
Harriet's inclination to ridicule the worship paid by the good people
of Hollingford to their liege lord, and to wonder with what tokens
of reverence they would receive Lady Harriet if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) came to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
promised visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had never thought of concealing the probability
of this call until this evening; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt as if it would be
better not to speak of the chance, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not at all sure that
the promise would be fulfilled.

<p/>Before Lady Harriet's call was paid, Molly received another visit.

<p/>Roger Hamley came riding over one day with a note from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mother,
and a wasps'-nest as a present from himself. Molly heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) powerful
voice come sounding up the little staircase, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) asked if Miss
Gibson was at home from the servant-maid at the door; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
half amused and half annoyed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought how this call of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
would give colour to Miss Browning's fancies. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather never
be married at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``than marry an ugly man,--and dear
good Mr. Roger is really ugly; I don't think one could even call him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
plain.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Yet Miss Brownings, who did not look upon young men as if
their natural costume was a helmet and a suit of armour, thought
Mr. Roger Hamley a very personable young fellow, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) came into
the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) face flushed with exercise, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) white teeth showing
pleasantly in the courteous bow and smile he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) gave to all around. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
knew the Miss Brownings slightly, and talked pleasantly to them while
Molly read Mrs. Hamley's little missive of sympathy and good wishes
relating to the wedding; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and though Miss
Brownings listened with all their ears, they could not find out
anything remarkable either in the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) said or the tone in which
they were spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've brought you the wasps'-nest I promised you, Miss Gibson. There
has been no lack of such things this year; we've taken seventy-four
on my father's land alone; and one of the labourers, a poor fellow
who ekes out his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wages by bee-keeping, has had a sad misfortune--the
wasps have turned the bees out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seven hives, taken possession,
and eaten up the honey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What greedy little vermin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning.

<p/>Molly saw Roger's eyes twinkle at the misapplication of the word; but
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had a strong sense of humour, it never appeared to diminish
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) respect for the people who amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure they deserve fire and brimstone more than the poor dear
innocent bees,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe. <div class="bookquote">``And then it seems so ungrateful
of mankind, who are going to feast on the honey!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sighed over the
thought, as if it was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>).

<p/>While Molly finished reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) note, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) explained its contents to
Miss Browning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother and I are going with my father to an agricultural meeting
at Canonbury on Thursday, and my mother desired me to say to you how
very much obliged she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should be if you would spare her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Miss Gibson
for the day. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was very anxious to ask for the pleasure of your
company, too, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) really is so poorly that we persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to
be content with Miss Gibson, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wouldn't scruple leaving a young
lady to amuse herself, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would be unwilling to do if you and
your sister were there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s very kind; very. Nothing would have given us more
pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, drawing herself up in gratified
dignity. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, we quite understand, Mr. Roger; and we fully
recognize Mrs. Hamley's kind intention. We will take the will for the
deed, as the common people express it. I believe that there was an
intermarriage between the Brownings and the Hamleys, a generation or
two ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay there was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger. <div class="bookquote">``My mother is very delicate, and
obliged to humour her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) health, which has made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) keep aloof from
society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I may go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, sparkling with the idea of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
dear Mrs. Hamley again, yet afraid of appearing too desirous of
leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) kind old friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, my dear. Write a pretty note, and tell Mrs. Hamley how
much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) we are for thinking of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I can't wait for a note,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger. <div class="bookquote">``I must take a
message instead, for I have to meet my father at one o'clock, and
it's close upon it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was gone, Molly felt so light-hearted at the thoughts of
Thursday that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could hardly attend to what the Miss Brownings were
saying. One was talking about the pretty muslin gown which Molly had
sent to the wash only that morning, and contriving how it could be
had back again in time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to wear; and the other, Miss Phoebe,
totally inattentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister's speaking for a wonder, was piping
out a separate strain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) own, and singing Roger Hamley's praises.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a fine-looking young man, and so courteous and affable. Like
the young men of our youth now, is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not, sister? And yet they all
say Mr. Osborne is the handsomest. What do you think, child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never seen Mr. Osborne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, blushing, and hating
herself for doing so. Why was it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said.
It was only that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fancy had dwelt on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) so much.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was gone--all the gentlemen were gone before the carriage, which
came to fetch Molly on Thursday, reached Hamley Hall. But Molly was
almost glad, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was so much afraid of being disappointed. Besides,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dear Mrs. Hamley the more to herself; the quiet sit in
the morning-room, talking poetry and romance; the midday saunter into
the garden, brilliant with autumnal flowers and glittering dew-drops
on the gossamer webs that stretched from scarlet to blue, and thence
to purple and yellow petals. As they were sitting at lunch, a strange
man's voice and step were heard in the hall; the door was opened,
and a young man came in, who could be no other than Osborne. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
beautiful and languid-looking, almost as frail in appearance as
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strongly resembled. This seeming delicacy made
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appear older than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dressed to perfection, and
yet with easy carelessness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, and stood by
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), holding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand, while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes sought Molly, not boldly or
impertinently, but as if appraising her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) critically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I'm back again. Bullocks, I find, are not in my line. I
only disappointed my father in not being able to appreciate their
merits, and, I'm afraid, I didn't care to learn. And the smell was
insufferable on such a hot day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, don't make apologies to me; keep them for your father.
I'm only too glad to have you back. Miss Gibson, this tall fellow is
my son Osborne, as I daresay you have guessed. Osborne--Miss Gibson.
Now, what will you have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked round the table as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sate down. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Isn't there some cold game-pie? I'll ring for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was trying to reconcile the ideal with the real. The ideal was
agile, yet powerful, with Greek features and an eagle-eye, capable
of enduring long fasting, and indifferent as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ate. The
real was almost effeminate in movement, though not in figure; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
the Greek features, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue eyes had a cold, weary expression
in them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dainty in eating, and had anything but a Homeric
appetite. However, Molly's hero was not to eat more than Ivanhoe,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was Friar Tuck's guest; and, after all, with a little
alteration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tuck</b></font>) began to think Mr. Osborne Hamley might turn out a
poetical, if not a chivalrous hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was extremely attentive to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mother, which pleased Molly, and, in return, Mrs. Hamley seemed
charmed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to such a degree that Molly once or twice fancied
that mother and son would have been happier in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) absence. Yet,
again, it struck on the shrewd, if simple girl, that Osborne was
mentally squinting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) in the conversation which was directed to
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother. There were little turns and `fioriture' of speech which
Molly could not help feeling were graceful antics of language not
common in the simple daily intercourse between mother and son. But
it was flattering rather than otherwise to perceive that a very fine
young man, who was a poet to boot, should think it worth while to
talk on the tight rope for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) benefit. And before the afternoon was
ended, without there having been any direct conversation between
Osborne and Molly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had reinstated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throne in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
imagination; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had almost felt herself disloyal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dear
Mrs. Hamley when, in the first hour after her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) introduction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
questioned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) claims on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's idolatry. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beauty came out
more and more, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became animated in some discussion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and
all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attitudes, if a little studied, were graceful in the extreme.
Before Molly left, the squire and Roger returned from Canonbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, red and panting. <div class="bookquote">``Why the deuce
couldn't you tell us you were coming home? I looked about for you
everywhere, just as we were going into the ordinary. I wanted to
introduce you to Grantley, and Fox, and Lord Forrest--men from the
other side of the county, whom you ought to know; and Roger there
missed above half his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) dinner hunting about for you; and all the time
you'd stole away, and were quietly sitting here with the women. I
wish you'd let me know the next time you make off. I've lost half my
pleasure in looking at as fine a lot of cattle as I ever saw, with
thinking you might be having one of your old attacks of faintness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have had one, I think, if I'd stayed longer in that
atmosphere. But I'm sorry if I've caused you anxiety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, somewhat mollified. <div class="bookquote">``And Roger,
too,--there I've been sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) here and sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) there all the
afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mind it, sir. I was only sorry you were so uneasy. I
thought Osborne had gone home, for I knew it wasn't much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) way,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/>Molly intercepted a glance between the two brothers--a look of true
confidence and love, which suddenly made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) like them both under the
aspect of relationship--new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) observation.

<p/>Roger came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and how are you getting on with Huber; don't you find him (<font color='blue'><b>Huber</b></font>) very
interesting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, penitently, <div class="bookquote">``I haven't read much. Miss
Brownings like me to talk; and, besides, there is so much to do at
home before papa comes back; and Miss Browning doesn't like me to go
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>). I know it sounds nothing, but it does take up a great
deal of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When is your father coming back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next Tuesday, I believe. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cannot stay long away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall ride over and pay my respects to Mrs. Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
shall come as soon as I may. Your father has been a very kind friend
to me ever since I was a boy. And when I come, I shall expect my
pupil to have been very diligent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) concluded, smiling his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) kind,
pleasant smile at idle Molly.

<p/>Then the carriage came round, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had the long solitary drive
back to Miss Brownings'. It was dark out of doors when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) got there;
but Miss Phoebe was standing on the stairs, with a lighted candle
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) hand, peering into the darkness to see Molly come in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Molly! I thought you'd never come back. Such a piece of news!
Sister has gone to bed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>)'s had a headache--with the excitement,
I think; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) says it's new bread. Come upstairs softly, my
dear, and I'll tell you what it is! Who do you think has been
here,--drinking tea with us, too, in the most condescending manner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Harriet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, suddenly enlightened by the word
<div class="bookquote">``condescending.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes. Why, how did you guess it? But, after all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) call, at any
rate in the first instance, was upon you. Oh, dear Molly! if you're
not in a hurry to go to bed, let me sit down quietly and tell you all
about it; for my heart jumps into my mouth still when I think of how
I was caught. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)--that is, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ladyship--left the carriage at ``The
George,'' and took to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) feet to go shopping--just as you or I may
have done many a time in our lives. And sister was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) forty
winks; and I was sitting with my gown up above my knees and my feet
on the fender, pulling out my grandmother's lace which I'd been
washing. The worst has yet to be told. I'd taken off my cap, for I
thought it was getting dusk and no one would come, and there was I in
my black silk skull-cap, when Nancy put her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) head in, and whispered,
``There's a lady downstairs--a real grand one, by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talk;' and in
there came my Lady Harriet, so sweet and pretty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ways, it was
some time before I remembered I had never a cap on. Sister never
wakened; or never roused up, so to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) thought it was
Nancy bringing in the tea when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) heard some one moving; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>)
ladyship, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) saw the state of the case, came and knelt
down on the rug by me, and begged my pardon so prettily for having
followed Nancy upstairs without waiting for permission; and was so
taken by my old lace, and wanted to know how I washed it, and where
you were, and when you'd be back, and when the happy couple would be
back: till sister wakened--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s always a little bit put out, you
know, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) first wakens from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) afternoon nap,--and, without
turning her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head to see who it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, quite sharp,--<div class="bookquote">``Buzz,
buzz, buzz! When will you learn that whispering is more fidgeting
than talking out loud? I've not been able to sleep at all for the
chatter you and Nancy have been keeping up all this time.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You know
that was a little fancy of sister's, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'d been snoring away as
naturally as could be. So I went to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and leant over her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and said
in a low voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Sister, it's her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) ladyship and me that has been conversing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Ladyship here, ladyship there! have you lost your wits, Phoebe,
that you talk such nonsense--and in your skull-cap, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>``By this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was sitting up--and, looking round her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) saw
Lady Harriet, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) velvets and silks, sitting on our rug, smiling,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) bonnet off, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) pretty hair all bright with the blaze of the
fire. My word! sister was up on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) feet directly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) dropped
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) curtsey, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) excuses for sleeping, as fast as might be,
while I went off to put on my best cap, for sister might well say I
was out of my wits to go on chatting to an earl's daughter in an old
black silk skull-cap. Black silk, too! when, if I'd only known she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
was coming, I might have put on my new brown silk one, lying idle in
my top drawer. And when I came back, sister was ordering tea for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
ladyship,--our tea, I mean. So I took my turn at talk, and sister
slipped out to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) Sunday silk. But I don't think we were
quite so much at our ease with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ladyship as when I sat pulling
out my lace in my skull-cap. And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was quite struck with our tea,
and asked where we got it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had never tasted any like it
before; and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) we gave only 3_s._ 4_d._ a pound for it, at
Johnson's---LRB-sister says I ought to have told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) the price of our
company-tea, which is 5_s._ a pound, only that was not what we were
drinking; for, as ill-luck would have it, we'd none of it in the
house-RRB---and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would send us some of hers, all the way
from Russia or Prussia, or some out-of-the-way place, and we were to
compare and see which we liked best; and if we liked hers best, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
could get it for us at 3_s._ a pound. And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) love for you;
and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was going away, you were not to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Sister
thought such a message would set you up too much, and told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>)
would not be chargeable for the giving it you. ``But,<div class="bookquote">'' I said, 'a
message is a message, and it's on Molly's own shoulders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s set
up by it. Let us show her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) an example of humility, sister, though we
have been sitting cheek-by-jowl in such company.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So sister humphed,
and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'d a headache, and went to bed. And now you may tell me
your news, my dear.''

<p/>So Molly told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) small events; which, interesting as they might
have been at other times to the gossip-loving and sympathetic Miss
Phoebe, were rather pale in the stronger light reflected from the
visit of an earl's daughter.




<p/>CHAPTER XV.

<p/>THE NEW MAMMA.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>On Tuesday afternoon Molly returned home--to the home which was
already strange, and what Warwickshire people would call <div class="bookquote">``unked,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Warwickshire people</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). New paint, new paper, new colours; grim servants dressed
in their best, and objecting to every change--from their master's
marriage to the new oilcloth in the hall, <div class="bookquote">``which tripped 'em up, and
threw 'em down, and was cold to the feet, and smelt just abominable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>All these complaints Molly had to listen to, and it was not a
cheerful preparation for the reception which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) already felt to be
so formidable.

<p/>The sound of their carriage-wheels was heard at last, and Molly went
to the front door to meet them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father got out first, and took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand and held it while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) helped his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bride to alight. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fondly, and passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) on to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) veil was so
securely -LRB-and becomingly-RRB- fastened down, that it was some time before
Mrs. Gibson could get her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lips clear to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) new daughter. Then
there was luggage to be seen about; and both the travellers were
occupied in this, while Molly stood by trembling with excitement,
unable to help, and only conscious of Betty's rather cross looks, as
heavy box after heavy box jammed up the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, my dear, show--your mamma to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) room!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson had hesitated, because the question of the name by
which Molly was to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) new relation had never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
before. The colour flashed into Molly's face. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``mamma?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--the name long appropriated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind to some one else--to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own dead mother. The rebellious heart rose against it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
said nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) led the way upstairs, Mrs. Gibson turning round,
from time to time, with some fresh direction as to which bag or trunk
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) needed most. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hardly spoke to Molly till they were both in
the newly-furnished bedroom, where a small fire had been lighted by
Molly's orders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my love, we can embrace each other in peace. O dear, how tired
I am!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>---LRB-after the embrace had been accomplished-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``My spirits are so
easily affected with fatigue; but your dear papa has been kindness
itself. Dear! what an old-fashioned bed! And what a-- But it doesn't
signify. By-and-by we'll renovate the house--won't we, my dear? And
you'll be my little maid to-night, and help me to arrange a few
things, for I'm just worn out with the day's journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've ordered a sort of tea-dinner to be ready for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I go and tell them to send it in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure if I can go down again to-night. It would be very
comfortable to have a little table brought in here, and sit in my
dressing-gown by this cheerful fire. But, to be sure, there's your
dear papa? I really don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would eat anything if I were not
there. One must not think about oneself, you know. Yes, I'll come
down in a quarter of an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Gibson had found a note awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), with an immediate
summons to an old patient, dangerously ill; and, snatching a mouthful
of food while his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) horse was being saddled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had to resume at once
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) old habits of attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) profession above everything.

<p/>As soon as Mrs. Gibson found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not likely to miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
presence--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had eaten a very tolerable lunch of bread and cold meat
in solitude, so her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fears about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) appetite in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) absence were not
well founded--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) desired to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) meal upstairs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own room;
and poor Molly, not daring to tell the servants of this whim, had to
carry up first a table, which, however small, was too heavy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>);
and afterwards all the choice portions of the meal, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
taken great pains to arrange on the table, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had seen such
things done at Hamley, intermixed with fruit and flowers that had
that morning been sent in from various great houses where Mr. Gibson
was respected and valued. How pretty Molly had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) handiwork
an hour or two before! How dreary it seemed as, at last released from
Mrs. Gibson's conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sate down in solitude to cold tea and
the drumsticks of the chicken! No one to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) preparations,
and admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) deft-handedness and taste! She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
father would be gratified by it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never seen it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
had meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) cares as an offering of good-will to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stepmother,
who even now was ringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) bell to have the tray taken away, and
Miss Gibson summoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) bedroom.

<p/>Molly hastily finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) meal, and went upstairs again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel so lonely, darling, in this strange house; do come and be
with me, and help me to unpack. I think your dear papa might have put
off his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) visit to Mr. Craven Smith for just this one evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Craven Smith couldn't put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) dying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, bluntly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You droll girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, with a faint laugh. <div class="bookquote">``But if this
Mr. Smith is dying, as you say, what's the use of your father's going
off to him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) in such a hurry? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) expect any legacy, or anything of
that kind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lips to prevent herself from saying something
disagreeable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only answered,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is dying. The man said so; and papa can
sometimes do something to make the last struggle easier. At any rate,
it's always a comfort to the family to have him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What dreary knowledge of death you have learned for a girl of your
age! Really, if I had heard all these details of your father's
profession, I doubt if I could have brought myself to have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't make the illness or the death; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) best against
them. I call it a very fine thing to think of what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does or tries
to do. And you will think so, too, when you see how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is watched
for, and how people welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't let us talk any more of such gloomy things, to-night! I
think I shall go to bed at once, I am so tired, if you will only sit
by me till I get sleepy, darling. If you will talk to me, the sound
of your voice will soon send me off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly got a book, and read her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother to sleep, preferring that
to the harder task of keeping up a continual murmur of speech.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stole down and went into the dining-room, where the fire
was gone out; purposely neglected by the servants, to mark their
displeasure at their new mistress's having had her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) tea in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) own
room. Molly managed to light it, however, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father came
home, and collected and re-arranged some comfortable food for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knelt down again on the hearth-rug, gazing into the fire in
a dreamy reverie, which had enough of sadness about it to cause the
tears to drop unnoticed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) jumped up, and shook
herself into brightness at the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is Mr. Craven Smith?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) just recognized me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was one of my first patients on
coming to Hollingford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson sate down in the arm-chair made ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), and warmed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hands at the fire, seeming neither to need food nor talk, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
went over a train of recollections. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) roused himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
sadness, and looking round the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said briskly enough,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where's the new mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was tired, and went to bed early. Oh, papa! must I call her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
`mamma?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), with a slight contraction of the
brows.

<p/>Molly was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) put a cup of tea near him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stirred it, and
sipped it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) recurred to the subject.

<p/>``Why shouldn't you call her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ``mamma?<div class="bookquote">'' I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) means to do the
duty of a mother to you. We all may make mistakes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ways may
not be quite all at once our ways; but at any rate let us start with
a family bond between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>What would Roger say was right?--that was the question that rose to
Molly's mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had always spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's new wife as Mrs.
Gibson, and had once burst out at Miss Brownings with a protestation
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) never would call her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``mamma.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) did not feel drawn to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>)
new relation by their intercourse that evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) kept silence,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) father was expecting an answer. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expectation, and turned to another subject; told about
their journey, questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) as to the Hamleys, the Brownings,
Lady Harriet, and the afternoon they had passed together at the
Manor-house. But there was a certain hardness and constraint in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>)
manner, and in hers a heaviness and absence of mind. All at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I will call her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) `mamma!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand, and grasped it tight; but for an instant or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>)
did not speak. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't be sorry for it, Molly, when you come to lie as poor
Craven Smith did to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For some time the murmurs and grumblings of the two elder servants
were confined to Molly's ears, then they spread to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's, who,
to Molly's dismay, made summary work with them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't like Mrs. Gibson's ringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) bell so often, don't you?
You've been spoilt, I'm afraid; but if you don't conform to my wife's
desires, you have the remedy in your own hands, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>servant</b></font>)</div><p/>What servant ever resisted the temptation to give warning after such
a speech as that? Betty told Molly she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was going to leave, in as
indifferent a manner as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could possibly assume towards the girl
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had tended and been about for the last sixteen years. Molly
had hitherto considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) former nurse as a fixture in the house;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would almost as soon have thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's proposing
to sever the relationship between them; and here was Betty coolly
talking over whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) next place should be in town or country. But
a great deal of this was assumed hardness. In a week or two Betty was
in floods of tears at the prospect of leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) nursling, and would
fain have stayed and answered all the bells in the house once every
quarter of an hour. Even Mr. Gibson's masculine heart was touched by
the sorrow of the old servant, which made itself obvious to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) every
time he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) came across her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) broken voice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) swollen eyes.

<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said to Molly, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd ask your mamma if Betty might
not stay, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) made a proper apology, and all that sort of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't much think it will be of any use,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in a mournful
voice. <div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) is writing, or has written, about some
under-housemaid at the Towers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!--all I want is peace and a decent quantity of cheerfulness
when I come home. I see enough of tears at other people's houses.
After all, Betty has been with us sixteen years--a sort of service
of the antique world. But the woman may be happier elsewhere. Do as
you like about asking mamma; only if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) agrees, I shall be quite
willing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So Molly tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand at making a request to that effect to Mrs.
Gibson. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) instinct told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would be unsuccessful; but surely
favour was never refused in so soft a tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl, I should never have thought of sending an old servant
away,--one who has had the charge of you from your birth, or nearly
so. I could not have had the heart to do it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have stayed
for ever for me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had only attended to all my wishes; and I am
not unreasonable, am I? But, you see, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) complained; and when your
dear papa spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave warning; and it is quite against
my principles ever to take an apology from a servant who has given
warning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is so sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>pleaded Molly; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will do anything you
wish, and attend to all your orders, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may only stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, sweet one, you seem to forget that I cannot go against my
principles, however much I may be sorry for Betty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) should not
have given way to ill-temper. As I said before, although I never
liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>), and considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) a most inefficient servant, thoroughly
spoilt by having had no mistress for so long, I should have borne
with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)--at least, I think I should--as long as I could. Now I have
all but engaged Maria, who was under-housemaid at the Towers, so
don't let me hear any more of Betty's sorrow, or anybody else's
sorrow, for I'm sure, what with your dear papa's sad stories and
other things, I'm getting quite low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was silent for a moment or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you quite engaged Maria?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I said `all but engaged.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>Sometimes one would think you did not
hear things, dear Molly!'' replied Mrs. Gibson, petulantly. <div class="bookquote">``Maria
is living in a place where they don't give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) as much wages as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
deserves. Perhaps they can't afford it, poor things! I'm always sorry
for poverty, and would never speak hardly of those who are not rich;
but I have offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) two pounds more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) gets at present, so I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)'ll leave. At any rate, if they increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wages, I shall
increase my offer in proportion; so I think I'm sure to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Such
a genteel girl!--always brings in a letter on a salver!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Betty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor old soul! I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)'ll profit by the lesson, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>sighed
out Mrs. Gibson; <div class="bookquote">``but it's a pity we hadn't Maria before the county
families began to call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson had been highly gratified by the circumstance of so many
calls <div class="bookquote">``from county families.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband was much respected; and
many ladies from various halls, courts, and houses, who had profited
by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) services towards themselves and their families, thought it
right to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) new wife the attention of a call when they drove
into Hollingford to shop. The state of expectation into which these
calls threw Mrs. Gibson rather diminished Mr. Gibson's domestic
comfort. It was awkward to be carrying hot, savoury-smelling dishes
from the kitchen to the dining-room at the very time when high-born
ladies, with noses of aristocratic refinement, might be calling.
Still more awkward was the accident which happened in consequence
of clumsy Betty's haste to open the front door to a lofty footman's
ran-tan, which caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) to set down the basket containing the dirty
plates right in his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) mistress's way, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) stepped gingerly through
the comparative darkness of the hall; and then the young men, leaving
the dining-room quietly enough, but bursting with long-repressed
giggle, or no longer restraining their tendency to practical joking,
no matter who might be in the passage when they made their exit. The
remedy proposed by Mrs. Gibson for all these distressing grievances
was a late dinner. The luncheon for the young men, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) observed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband, might be sent into the surgery. A few elegant cold
trifles for herself and Molly would not scent the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
would always take care to have some little dainty ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
acceded, but unwillingly, for it was an innovation on the habits of
a lifetime, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should never be able to arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
rounds aright with this new-fangled notion of a six o'clock dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't get any dainties for me, my dear; bread-and-cheese is the
chief of my diet, like it was that of the old woman's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of your old woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife; <div class="bookquote">``but really I
cannot allow cheese to come beyond the kitchen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll eat it there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's close to the stable-yard,
and if I come in in a hurry I can get it in a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Mr. Gibson, it is astonishing to compare your appearance and
manners with your tastes. You look such a gentleman, as dear Lady
Cumnor used to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the cook left; also an old servant, though not so old a one as
Betty. The cook did not like the trouble of late dinners; and, being
a Methodist, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) objected on religious grounds to trying any of
Mrs. Gibson's new receipts for French dishes. It was not scriptural,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said. There was a deal of mention of food in the Bible; but it
was of sheep ready dressed, which meant mutton, and of wine, and
of bread-and-milk, and figs and raisins, of fatted calves, a good
well-browned fillet of veal, and such like; but it had always gone
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) conscience to cook swine-flesh and make raised pork-pies,
and now if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was to be set to cook heathen dishes after the fashion
of the Papists, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'d sooner give it all up together. So the cook
followed in Betty's track, and Mr. Gibson had to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) healthy
English appetite on badly-made omelettes, rissoles, vol-au-vents,
croquets, and timbales; never being exactly sure what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was eating.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind before his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) marriage to yield in trifles,
and be firm in greater things. But the differences of opinion about
trifles arose every day, and were perhaps more annoying than if they
had related to things of more consequence. Molly knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's
looks as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) alphabet; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife did not; and being
an unperceptive person, except when her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own interests were dependent
upon another person's humour, never found out how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was worried by
all the small daily concessions which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) will or her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
whims. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never allowed himself to put any regret into shape, even
in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) repeatedly reminded himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife's good
qualities, and comforted himself by thinking they should work
together better as time rolled on; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very angry at a
bachelor great-uncle of Mr. Coxe's, who, after taking no notice of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) red-headed nephew for years, suddenly sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>), after the old
man had partially recovered from a serious attack of illness, and
appointed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heir, on condition that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great-nephew remained
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) during the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. This had happened almost
directly after Mr. and Mrs. Gibson's return from their wedding
journey, and once or twice since that time Mr. Gibson had found
himself wondering why the deuce old Benson could not have made
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind sooner, and so have rid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) house of the unwelcome
presence of the young lover. To do Mr. Coxe justice, in the very
last conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) had as a pupil with Mr. Gibson he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said, with
hesitating awkwardness, that perhaps the new circumstances in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) should be placed might make some difference with regard to Mr.
Gibson's opinion on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, quickly. <div class="bookquote">``You are both of you too
young to know your own minds; and if my daughter was silly enough to
be in love, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should never have to calculate her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) happiness on the
chances of an old man's death. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll disinherit you after
all. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may do, and then you'd be worse off than ever. No! go away,
and forget all this nonsense; and when you've done, come back and see
us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div><p/>So Mr. Coxe went away, with an oath of unalterable faithfulness in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) heart; and Mr. Gibson had unwillingly to fulfil an old promise
made to a gentleman farmer in the neighbourhood a year or two before,
and to take the second son of Mr. Browne in young Coxe's place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
was to be the last of the race of pupils, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was rather more
than a year younger than Molly, Mr. Gibson trusted that there would
be no repetition of the Coxe romance.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI.

<p/>THE BRIDE AT HOME.


<p/>Among the <div class="bookquote">``county people''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as Mrs. Gibson termed them-RRB- who called
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) as a bride, were the two young Mr. Hamleys. The Squire,
their father, had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) congratulations, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) ever
intended to do them, to Mr. Gibson himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came to the hall;
but Mrs. Hamley, unable to go and pay visits herself, anxious to show
attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) kind doctor's new wife, and with perhaps a little
sympathetic curiosity as to how Molly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother got on
together, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sons ride over to Hollingford with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cards and
apologies. They came into the newly-furnished drawing-room, looking
bright and fresh from their ride: Osborne first, as usual, perfectly
dressed for the occasion, and with the sort of fine manner which
sate so well upon him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); Roger, looking like a strong-built, cheerful,
intelligent country farmer, followed in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) brother's train. Mrs.
Gibson was dressed for receiving callers, and made the effect she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
always intended to produce, of a very pretty woman, no longer in
first youth, but with such soft manners and such a caressing voice,
that people forgot to wonder what her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) real age might be. Molly was
better dressed than formerly; her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother saw after that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
disliked anything old or shabby, or out of taste about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); it hurt
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eye; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had already fidgeted Molly into a new amount of care
about the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) clothes, arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hair,
and was gloved and shod. Mrs. Gibson had tried to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) through a
course of rosemary washes and creams in order to improve her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) tanned
complexion; but about that Molly was either forgetful or rebellious,
and Mrs. Gibson could not well come up to the girl's bedroom every
night and see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daubed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face and neck over with the
cosmetics so carefully provided for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). Still her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) appearance was
extremely improved, even to Osborne's critical eye. Roger sought
rather to discover in her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) looks and expression whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was happy
or not; his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother had especially charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to note all these
signs.

<p/>Osborne and Mrs. Gibson made themselves agreeable to each other
according to the approved fashion when a young man calls on a
middle-aged bride. They talked of the <div class="bookquote">``Shakspeare and musical
glasses''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>of the day, each vieing with the other in their knowledge
of London topics. Molly heard fragments of their conversation in the
pauses of silence between Roger and herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hero was coming
out in quite a new character; no longer literary or poetical, or
romantic, or critical, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was now full of the last new play, the
singers at the opera. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had the advantage over Mrs. Gibson, who, in
fact, only spoke of these things from hearsay, from listening to the
talk at the Towers, while Osborne had run up from Cambridge two or
three times to hear this, or to see that wonder of the season. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had the advantage over him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in greater boldness of invention to
eke out her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) facts; and besides she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had more skill in the choice and
arrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) words, so as to make it appear as if the opinions
that were in reality quotations, were formed by herself from actual
experience or personal observation; such as, in speaking of the
mannerisms of a famous Italian singer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) would ask,--


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: SHAKSPEARE AND THE MUSICAL GLASSES.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you observe her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) constant trick of heaving her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shoulders and
clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hands together before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) took a high note?'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>--which was
so said as to imply that Mrs. Gibson herself had noticed this trick.
Molly, who had a pretty good idea by this time of how her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother
had passed the last year of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life, listened with no small
bewilderment to this conversation; but at length decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
must misunderstand what they were saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not gather up
the missing links for the necessity of replying to Roger's questions
and remarks. Osborne was not the same Osborne he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was when with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
mother at the Hall.

<p/>Roger saw Molly glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think my brother looking ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is not well. Both my father and I are anxious about him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
That run on the Continent did him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) harm, instead of good; and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
disappointment at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) examination has told upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), I'm afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) looked ill; only changed somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) must go back to Cambridge soon. Possibly it may do him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
good; and I shall be off next week. This is a farewell visit to you,
as well as one of congratulation to Mrs. Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother will feel your both going away, won't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? But of course
young men will always have to live away from home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Still she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feels it a good deal; and I'm not
satisfied about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) health either. You will go out and see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
sometimes, will you? she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is very fond of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, unconsciously glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had an uncomfortable instinct that, in spite of Mrs. Gibson's own
perpetual flow of words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could, and did, hear everything that
fell from Molly's lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want any more books?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you do, make a list out,
and send it to my mother before I leave, next Tuesday. After I am
gone, there will be no one to go into the library and pick them out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as they had left, Mrs. Gibson began her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usual comments on the
departed visitors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like that Osborne Hamley! What a nice fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is! Somehow,
I always do like eldest sons. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will have the estate, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? I
shall ask your dear papa to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to come about the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
will be a very good, very pleasant acquaintance for you and Cynthia.
The other is but a loutish young fellow, to my mind; there is no
aristocratic bearing about him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) takes after his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother,
who is but a parvenue, I've heard them say at the Towers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was spiteful enough to have great pleasure in saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I've heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father was a Russian merchant, and imported
tallow and hemp. Mr. Osborne Hamley is extremely like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! But there's no calculating these things. Anyhow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is the
perfect gentleman in appearance and manner. The estate is entailed,
is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/>A short silence ensued. Then Mrs. Gibson said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I almost think I must get dear papa to give a little
dinner-party, and ask Mr. Osborne Hamley? I should like to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
feel at home in this house. It would be something cheerful for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
after the dulness and solitude of Hamley Hall. For the old people
don't visit much, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s going back to Cambridge next week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)? Well, then, we'll put off our little dinner till Cynthia
comes home. I should like to have some young society for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), poor
darling, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) returns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When is she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, who had always a longing curiosity
for this same Cynthia's return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I'm not sure; perhaps at the new year--perhaps not till Easter.
I must get this drawing-room all new furnished first; and then I mean
to fit up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) room and yours just alike. They are just the same size,
only on opposite sides of the passage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to new-furnish that room?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in astonishment
at the never-ending changes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and yours, too, darling; so don't be jealous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, mamma, not mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, taking in the idea for the
first time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear! You shall have yours done as well. A little French bed,
and a new paper, and a pretty carpet, and a dressed-up toilet-table
and glass, will make it look quite a different place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't want it to look different. I like it as it is. Pray
don't do anything to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense, child! I never heard anything more ridiculous!
Most girls would be glad to get rid of furniture only fit for the
lumber-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my own mamma's before she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in a
very low voice; bringing out this last plea unwillingly, but with a
certainty that it would not be resisted.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson paused for a moment before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very much to your credit that you should have such feelings,
I'm sure. But don't you think sentiment may be carried too far? Why,
we should have no new furniture at all, and should have to put up
with worm-eaten horrors. Besides, my dear, Hollingford will seem very
dull to Cynthia, after pretty, gay France, and I want to make the
first impressions attractive. I've a notion I can settle her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) down
near here; and I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to come in a good temper; for, between
ourselves, my dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is a little, leetle wilful. You need not
mention this to your papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But can't you do Cynthia's room, and not mine? Please let mine
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed! I couldn't agree to that. Only think what would be said
of me by everybody; petting my own child and neglecting my husband's!
I couldn't bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one need know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In such a tittle-tattle place as Hollingford! Really, Molly, you are
either very stupid or very obstinate, or else you don't care what
hard things may be said about me: and all for a selfish fancy of
your own! No! I owe myself the justice of acting in this matter as I
please. Every one shall know I'm not a common stepmother. Every penny
I spend on Cynthia I shall spend on you too; so it's no use talking
any more about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So Molly's little white dimity bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) old-fashioned chest of
drawers, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) other cherished relics of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's maiden-days,
were consigned to the lumber-room; and after a while, when Cynthia
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) great French boxes had come home, the old furniture that had
filled up the space required for the fresh importation of trunks,
disappeared likewise into the same room.

<p/>All this time the family at the Towers had been absent; Lady Cumnor
had been ordered to Bath for the early part of the winter, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
family were with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) there. On dull rainy days, Mrs. Gibson used to
bethink her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of missing <div class="bookquote">``the Cumnors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>for so she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had taken to calling
them since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) position had become more independent of theirs. It
marked a distinction between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) intimacy in the family, and the
reverential manner in which the townspeople were accustomed to speak
of <div class="bookquote">``the earl and the countess.''  (<font color='red'><b>the townspeople</b></font>)</div>Both Lady Cumnor and Lady Harriet
wrote to their <div class="bookquote">``dear Clare''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>from time to time. The former had
generally some commissions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wished to have executed at the
Towers, or in the town; and no one could do them so well as Clare,
who was acquainted with all the tastes and ways of the countess.
These commissions were the cause of various bills for flys and cars
from the George Inn. Mr. Gibson pointed out this consequence to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), in return, bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) remark that a present of
game was pretty sure to follow upon the satisfactory execution of
Lady Cumnor's wishes. Somehow, Mr. Gibson did not quite like this
consequence either; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was silent about it, at any rate. Lady
Harriet's letters were short and amusing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had that sort of regard
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) old governess which prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to write from time to time,
and to feel glad when the half-voluntary task was accomplished. So
there was no real outpouring of confidence, but enough news of the
family and gossip of the place she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was in, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thought would
make Clare feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was not forgotten by her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) former pupils,
intermixed with moderate but sincere expressions of regard. How
those letters were quoted and referred to by Mrs. Gibson in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
conversations with the Hollingford ladies! She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had found out their
effect at Ashcombe; and it was not less at Hollingford. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
rather perplexed at kindly messages to Molly, and at inquiries as
to how the Miss Brownings liked the tea she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) had sent; and Molly
had first to explain, and then to narrate at full length, all the
occurrences of the afternoon at Ashcombe Manor-house, and Lady
Harriet's subsequent call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at Miss Brownings'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, with some annoyance. <div class="bookquote">``Lady Harriet
only went to see you out of a desire of amusement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would only
make fun of Miss Brownings, and those two will be quoting her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) and
talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>), just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) was their intimate friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) did make fun of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) really seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>)
had been very kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And you suppose you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) ways better than I do who have known
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) these fifteen years? I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) turns every one into ridicule
who does not belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) set. Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) used always to speak of Miss
Brownings as <div class="bookquote">``Pecksy and Flapsy.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) promised me she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownings</b></font>) would not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly driven to bay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Promised you!--Lady Harriet? What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only--she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spoke of them as Pecksy and Flapsy--and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) talked of
coming to call on me at their house, I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) not to come if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
was going to--to make fun of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word! with all my long acquaintance with Lady Harriet, I
should never have ventured on such impertinence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean it as impertinence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly sturdily. <div class="bookquote">``And I don't
think Lady Harriet took it as such.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't know anything about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can put on any kind of
manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Just then Squire Hamley came in. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) first call; and Mrs.
Gibson gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) a graceful welcome, and was quite ready to accept
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) apology for its tardiness, and to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) quite
understood the pressure of business on every land-owner who farmed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own estate. But no such apology was made. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand
heartily, as a mark of congratulation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) good fortune in having
secured such a prize as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) friend Gibson, but said nothing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
long neglect of duty. Molly, who by this time knew the few strong
expressions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) countenance well, was sure that something was the
matter, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was very much disturbed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) hardly attended to
Mrs. Gibson's fluent opening of conversation, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had already
determined to make a favourable impression on the father of the
handsome young man who was heir to an estate, besides his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) own
personal agreeableness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) turned to Molly and, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
said--almost in a low voice, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) was making a confidence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) did not intend Mrs. Gibson to hear,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, we are all wrong at home! Osborne has lost the fellowship
at Trinity he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) went back to try for. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has gone and failed
miserably in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) degree, after all that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mother
said; and I, like a fool, went and boasted about my clever son. I
can't understand it. I never expected anything extraordinary from
Roger; but Osborne--! And then it has thrown madam into one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
bad fits of illness; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) seems to have a fancy for you, child!
Your father came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) this morning. Poor thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)'s very
poorly, I'm afraid; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) should like to have you
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said I might fetch you. You'll come, won't you, my
dear? She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)'s not a poor woman, such as many people think it's the only
charity to be kind to, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)'s just as forlorn of woman's care as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was poor--worse, I daresay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be ready in ten minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, much touched by the
squire's words and manner, never thinking of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother's
consent, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had heard that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father had given his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
rose to leave the room, Mrs. Gibson, who had only half heard what the
Squire had said, and was a little affronted at the exclusiveness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) confidence, said,--<div class="bookquote">``My dear, where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Hamley wants me, and papa says I may go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; and
almost at the same time the Squire replied,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife is ill, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s very fond of your daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) begged
Mr. Gibson to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to come to the Hall for a little while, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) kindly said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might, and I'm come to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a minute, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson to Molly--a slight cloud
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) countenance, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) caressing word. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure dear
papa quite forgot that you were to go out with me to-night, to visit
people,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), addressing herself to the Squire, <div class="bookquote">``with whom
I am quite unacquainted--and it is very uncertain if Mr. Gibson can

go with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have thought it would have signified. Brides are always
brides, I suppose; and it's their part to be timid; but I shouldn't

as sick people do. Well, Molly''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-in a louder tone, for these
foregoing sentences were spoken _sotto voce_-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``we must put it off
till to-morrow: and it's our loss, not yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) continued, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) saw the reluctance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) slowly returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) place.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll be as gay as can be to-night, I daresay--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shall not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>broke in Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I never wanted to go, and now I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson; and, addressing the Squire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``The visiting here is not all one could wish for so young a
girl--no young people, no dances, nothing of gaiety; but it is wrong
in you, Molly, to speak against such kind friends of your father's as

yourself to the kind Squire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) alone! let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>quoth he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) means.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'d rather come and be in my wife's sick-room than go out for this

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None whatever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``An engagement is an engagement
with me; and I consider that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is not only engaged to Mrs.

 (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire was put out; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was put out he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had a trick of
placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) knees and whistling softly to himself. Molly
knew this phase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) displeasure, and only hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would confine
himself to this wordless expression of annoyance. It was pretty hard
work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to keep the tears out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) endeavoured
to think of something else, rather than dwell on regrets and
annoyances. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard Mrs. Gibson talking on in a sweet monotone, and
wished to attend to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was saying, but the Squire's visible
annoyance struck sharper on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind. At length, after a pause of
silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) started up, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! it's no use. Poor madam; she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) won't like it. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)'ll be
disappointed! But it's but for one evening!--but for one evening! She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
may come to-morrow, mayn't she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)? Or will the dissipation of such an
evening as she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) describes, be too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a touch of savage irony in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) manner which frightened Mrs.
Gibson into good behaviour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) shall be ready at any time you name. I am so sorry: my foolish
shyness is in fault, I believe; but still you must acknowledge that
an engagement is an engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I ever say an engagement was an elephant, madam? However,
there's no use saying any more about it, or I shall forget my
manners. I'm an old tyrant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)--lying there in bed, poor
girl--has always given me my own way. So you'll excuse me, Mrs.
Gibson, won't you; and let Molly come along with me at ten to-morrow
morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, smiling. But when his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) back was turned,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said to Molly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear, I must never have you exposing me to the ill-manners
of such a man again! I don't call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a squire; I call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a boor,
or a yeoman at best. You must not go on accepting or rejecting
invitations as if you were an independent young lady, Molly. Pay me
the respect of a reference to my wishes another time, if you please,
my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa had said I might go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, choking a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I am now your mamma, your references must be to me, for the
future. But as you are to go you may as well look well dressed. I
will lend you my new shawl for this visit, if you like it, and my set
of green ribbons. I am always indulgent when proper respect is paid
to me. And in such a house as Hamley Hall, no one can tell who may be
coming and going, even if there is sickness in the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. But I don't want the shawl and the ribbons, please: there
will be nobody there except the family. There never is, I think; and
now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) is so ill'' (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>--Molly was on the point of crying at the
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) friend lying ill and lonely, and looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
arrival. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sadly afraid lest the Squire had gone off
with the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not want to come--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) preferred that
stupid, stupid party at the Cockerells'. Mrs. Gibson, too, was sorry;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had an uncomfortable consciousness of having given way to temper
before a stranger, and a stranger, too, whose good opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
meant to cultivate; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was also annoyed at Molly's tearful face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you, to bring you back into good temper?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``First, you insist upon your knowing Lady Harriet better than
I do--I, who have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) for eighteen or nineteen years at least.
Then you jump at invitations without ever consulting me, or thinking
of how awkward it would be for me to go stumping into a drawing-room
all by myself; following my new name, too, which always makes me feel
uncomfortable, it is such a sad come-down after Kirkpatrick! And
then, when I offer you some of the prettiest things I have got, you
say it does not signify how you are dressed. What can I do to please
you, Molly? I, who delight in nothing more than peace in a family, to
see you sitting there with despair upon your face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly could stand it no longer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
room--her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own smart new room, which hardly yet seemed a familiar
place; and began to cry so heartily and for so long a time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
stopped at length for very weariness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought of Mrs. Hamley
wearying for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); of the old Hall whose very quietness might become
oppressive to an ailing person; of the trust the Squire had had in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would come off directly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). And all this oppressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) much more than the querulousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother's words.




<p/>CHAPTER XVII.

<p/>TROUBLE AT HAMLEY HALL.


<p/>If Molly thought that peace dwelt perpetually at Hamley Hall
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sorely mistaken. Something was out of tune in the whole
establishment; and, for a very unusual thing, the common irritation
seemed to have produced a common bond. All the servants were old in
their places, and were told by some one of the family, or gathered,
from the unheeded conversation carried on before them, everything
that affected master or mistress or either of the young gentlemen.
Any one of them could have told Molly that the grievance which lay at
the root of everything, was the amount of the bills run up by Osborne
at Cambridge, and which, now that all chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) obtaining a
fellowship was over, came pouring down upon the Squire. But Molly,
confident of being told by Mrs. Hamley herself anything which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to hear, encouraged no confidences from any one else.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was struck with the change in <div class="bookquote">``madam's''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>look as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) in the darkened room, lying on the sofa in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
dressing-room, all dressed in white, which almost rivalled the white
wanness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) face. The Squire ushered Molly in with,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>and Molly had scarcely imagined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had so
much variety in the tones of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) voice--the beginning of the sentence
was spoken in a loud congratulatory manner, while the last words
were scarcely audible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had seen the death-like pallor on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
wife's face; not a new sight, and one which had been presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
gradually enough, but which was now always giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) a fresh shock.
It was a lovely tranquil winter's day; every branch and every twig
on the trees and shrubs was glittering with drops of the sun-melted
hoar-frost; a robin was perched on a holly-bush, piping cheerily; but
the blinds were down, and out of Mrs. Hamley's windows nothing of all
this was to be seen. There was even a large screen placed between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) and the wood-fire, to keep off that cheerful blaze. Mrs. Hamley
stretched out one hand to Molly, and held hers firm; with the other
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is not so well this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``But never fear, my dear one; here's the doctor's daughter, nearly
as good as the doctor himself. Have you had your medicine? Your
beef-tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) continued, going about on heavy tiptoe and peeping into
every empty cup and glass. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) returned to the sofa; looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for a minute or two, and then softly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and told Molly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in charge.

<p/>As if Mrs. Hamley was afraid of Molly's remarks or questions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
began in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) turn a hasty system of interrogatories.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, dear child, tell me all; it's no breach of confidence, for I
shan't mention it again, and I shan't be here long. How does it all
go on--the new mother, the good resolutions? let me help you if I
can. I think with a girl I could have been of use--a mother does not
know boys. But tell me anything you like and will; don't be afraid of
details.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Even with Molly's small experience of illness she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw how much of
restless fever there was in this speech; and instinct, or some
such gift, prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to tell a long story of many things--the
wedding-day, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) visit to Miss Brownings', the new furniture, Lady
Harriet, &c., all in an easy flow of talk which was very soothing
to Mrs. Hamley, inasmuch as it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) something to think about
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own immediate sorrows. But Molly did not speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
grievances, nor of the new domestic relationship. Mrs. Hamley noticed
this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you and Mrs. Gibson get on happily together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``You know we didn't know much of each other
before we were put to live together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't like what the Squire told me last night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was very
angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That sore had not yet healed over; but Molly resolutely kept silence,
beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) brains to think of some other subject of conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I see, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley; <div class="bookquote">``you won't tell me your
sorrows, and yet, perhaps, I could have done you some good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I think papa wouldn't
like it. And, besides, you have helped me so much--you and Mr.
Roger Hamley. I often think of the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) said; they come in so
usefully, and are such a strength to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Roger! yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is to be trusted. Oh, Molly! I've a great deal
to say to you myself, only not now. I must have my medicine and try
to go to sleep. Good girl! You are stronger than I am, and can do
without sympathy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was taken to another room; the maid who conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to it
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that Mrs. Hamley had not wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) nights
disturbed, as they might very probably have been if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had been in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) former sleeping-room. In the afternoon Mrs. Hamley sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>),
and with the want of reticence common to invalids, especially to
those suffering from long and depressing maladies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) told Molly of
the family distress and disappointment.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made Molly sit down near her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) on a little stool, and, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
hand, and looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoken sympathy from
their expression quicker than she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne has so disappointed us! I cannot understand it yet. And the
Squire was so terribly angry! I cannot think how all the money was
spent--advances through money-lenders, besides bills. The Squire
does not show me how angry he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is now, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)'s afraid of another
attack; but I know how angry he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is. You see he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) has been spending ever
so much money in reclaiming that land at Upton Common, and is very
hard pressed himself. But it would have doubled the value of the
estate, and so we never thought anything of economies which would
benefit Osborne in the long run. And now the Squire says he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) must
mortgage some of the land; and you can't think how it cuts him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) to
the heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sold a great deal of timber to send the two boys to
college. Osborne--oh! what a dear, innocent boy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was the
heir, you know; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was so clever, every one said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sure of
honours and a fellowship, and I don't know what all; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did get
a scholarship, and then all went wrong. I don't know how. That is
the worst. Perhaps the Squire wrote too angrily, and that stopped up
confidence. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might have told me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would have done, I think,
Molly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been here, face to face with me. But the Squire, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) anger, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) not to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) face at home till he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had paid off
the debts he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had incurred out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) allowance. Out of two hundred
and fifty a year to pay off more than nine hundred, one way or
another! And not to come home till then! Perhaps Roger will have
debts too! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had but two hundred; but, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was not the eldest
son. The Squire has given orders that the men are to be turned off
the draining-works; and I lie awake thinking of their poor families
this wintry weather. But what shall we do? I've never been strong,
and, perhaps, I've been extravagant in my habits; and there were
family traditions as to expenditure, and the reclaiming of this land.
Oh! Molly, Osborne was such a sweet little baby, and such a loving
boy: so clever, too! You know I read you some of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) poetry: now,
could a person who wrote like that do anything very wrong? And yet
I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know, at all, how the money has gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! not at all. That's the sting. There are tailors' bills,
and bills for book-binding and wine and pictures--those come
to four or five hundred; and though this expenditure is
extraordinary--inexplicable to such simple folk as we are--yet it
may be only the luxury of the present day. But the money for which
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will give no account,--of which, indeed, we only heard through
the Squire's London agents, who found out that certain disreputable
attorneys were making inquiries as to the entail of the estate;--oh!
Molly, worse than all--I don't know how to bring myself to tell
you--as to the age and health of the Squire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) dear father'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>---LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
began to sob almost hysterically; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would go on talking, in
spite of Molly's efforts to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``who held him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) arms, and
blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), even before I had kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); and thought always so much
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heir and first-born darling. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) has loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)! How
I have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)! I sometimes have thought of late that we've almost
done that good Roger injustice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I'm sure you've not: only look at the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) loves you. Why, you
are his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) first thought: he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) may not speak about it, but any one may see
it. And dear, dear Mrs. Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, determined to say out
all that was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had once got the word, <div class="bookquote">``don't
you think that it would be better not to misjudge Mr. Osborne Hamley?
We don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has done with the money: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is so good -LRB-is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
not?-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) may have wanted it to relieve some poor person--some
tradesman, for instance, pressed by creditors--some--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley, smiling a little at the girl's
impetuous romance, but sighing the next instant, <div class="bookquote">``that all the other
bills come from tradesmen, who complain piteously of being kept out
of their money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was nonplussed for the moment; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay they imposed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>). I'm sure I've heard stories of
young men being made regular victims of by the shopkeepers in great
towns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a great darling, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley, comforted by
Molly's strong partisanship, unreasonable and ignorant though it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>continued Molly, <div class="bookquote">``some one must be acting wrongly in
Osborne's--Mr. Osborne Hamley's, I mean--I can't help saying Osborne
sometimes, but, indeed, I always think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) as Mr. Osborne--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Molly, what you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>); only go on talking. It
seems to do me good to hear the hopeful side taken. The Squire has
been so hurt and displeased: strange-looking men coming into the
neighbourhood, too, questioning the tenants, and grumbling about the
last fall of timber, as if they were calculating on the Squire's
death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I was going to speak about. Doesn't it show that
they are bad men? and would bad men scruple to impose upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and
to tell lies in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) name, and to ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you see, you only make him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) out weak, instead of wicked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; perhaps I do. But I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is weak. You know yourself,
dear Mrs. Hamley, how very clever he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) really is. Besides, I would
rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was weak than wicked. Weak people may find themselves all
at once strong in heaven, when they see things quite clearly; but I
don't think the wicked will turn themselves into virtuous people all
at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I've been very weak, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hamley, stroking
Molly's curls affectionately. <div class="bookquote">``I've made such an idol of my beautiful
Osborne; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) turns out to have feet of clay, not strong enough to
stand firm on the ground. And that's the best view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) conduct,
too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>What with his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) anger against his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) son, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) anxiety about his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wife;
the difficulty of raising the money immediately required, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
irritation at the scarce-concealed inquiries made by strangers as to
the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) property, the poor Squire was in a sad state. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
was angry and impatient with every one who came near him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); and then
was depressed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own violent temper and unjust words. The old
servants, who, perhaps, cheated him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in many small things, were
beautifully patient under his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) upbraidings. They could understand
bursts of passion, and knew the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) variable moods as well
as he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) did himself. The butler, who was accustomed to argue with his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
master about every fresh direction as to his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) work, now nudged Molly
at dinner-time to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eat of some dish which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had just been
declining, and explained his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) conduct afterwards as follows:--

<p/>``You see, miss, me and cook had planned a dinner as would tempt
master to eat; but when you say, ``No, thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' when I hand you
anything, master never so much as looks at it. But if you takes a
thing, and eats with a relish, why first he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) waits, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) looks,
and by-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) smells; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) finds out as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s hungry, and
falls to eating as natural as a kitten takes to mewing. That's the
reason, miss, as I gave you a nudge and a wink, which no one knows
better nor me was not manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne's name was never mentioned during these cheerless meals. The
Squire asked Molly questions about Hollingford people, but did not
seem much to attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) answers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) used also to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) every day
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife was; but if Molly told the truth--that
every day seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) weaker and weaker--he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was almost savage
with the girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could not bear it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would not. Nay, once he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
was on the point of dismissing Mr. Gibson because he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) insisted on a
consultation with Dr. Nicholls, the great physician of the county.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nonsense thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) so ill as that--you know it's only the
delicacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)'s had for years; and if you can't do her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) any good in
such a simple case--no pain--only weakness and nervousness--it is a
simple case, eh?--don't look in that puzzled way, man!--you'd better
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) up altogether, and I'll take her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) to Bath or Brighton,
or somewhere for change, for in my opinion it's only moping and
nervousness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>But the Squire's bluff florid face was pinched with anxiety, and worn
with the effort of being deaf to the footsteps of fate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said
these words which belied his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) fears.

<p/>Mr. Gibson replied very quietly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go on coming to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>), and I know you'll not forbid my
visits. But I shall bring Dr. Nicholls with me the next time I come.
I may be mistaken in my treatment; and I wish to God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may say I am
mistaken in my apprehensions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me them! I cannot bear them!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>cried the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course we must all die; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) must too. But the cleverest doctor
in England shan't go about coolly meting out the life of such as her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>).
I daresay I shall die first. I hope I shall. But I'll knock any one
down who speaks to me of death sitting within me. And, besides, I
think all doctors are ignorant quacks, pretending to knowledge they
haven't got. Ay, you may smile at me. I don't care. Unless you can
tell me I shall die first, neither you nor your Dr. Nicholls shall
come prophesying and croaking about this house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson went away, heavy at heart from the thought of Mrs.
Hamley's approaching death, but thinking little enough of the
Squire's speeches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had almost forgotten them, in fact, when about
nine o'clock that evening, a groom rode in from Hamley Hall in hot
haste, with a note from the Squire.


<p/>DEAR GIBSON,--

<p/>For God's sake forgive me if I was rude to-day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is
much worse. Come and spend the night here. Write for
Nicholls, and all the physicians you want. Write before
you start off. They may give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) ease. There were
Whitworth doctors much talked of in my youth for curing
people given up by the regular doctors; can't you get one
of them? I put myself in your hands. Sometimes I think it
is the turning point, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'ll rally after this bout. I
trust all to you.

<p/>Yours ever,

<p/>R. HAMLEY.

<p/>P.S.--Molly is a treasure.--God help me!


<p/>Of course Mr. Gibson went; for the first time since his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) marriage
cutting short Mrs. Gibson's querulous lamentations over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) life,
as involved in that of a doctor called out at all hours of day and
night.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brought Mrs. Hamley through this attack; and for a day or two the
Squire's alarm and gratitude made him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) docile in Mr. Gibson's hands.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) returned to the idea of its being a crisis through which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
wife had passed; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was now on the way to recovery. But
the day after the consultation with Dr. Nicholls, Mr. Gibson said to
Molly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly! I've written to Osborne and Roger. Do you know Osborne's
address?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s in disgrace. I don't know if the Squire knows; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) has been too ill to write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind. I'll enclose it to Roger; whatever those lads may be to
others, there's as strong brotherly love as ever I saw, between the
two. Roger will know. And, Molly, they are sure to come home as soon
as they hear my report of their mother's state. I wish you'd tell the
Squire what I've done. It's not a pleasant piece of work; and I'll
tell madam myself in my own way. I'd have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)'d been at
home; but you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was obliged to go to Ashcombe on business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite obliged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was so sorry to miss you. But, papa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) will be so
angry! You don't know how mad he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is against Osborne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly dreaded the Squire's anger when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's
message. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had seen quite enough of the domestic relations of
the Hamley family to understand that, underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) old-fashioned
courtesy, and the pleasant hospitality he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) showed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) as a guest,
there was a strong will, and a vehement passionate temper, along with
that degree of obstinacy in prejudices -LRB-or <div class="bookquote">``opinions,''  (<font color='red'><b>a guest</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would
have called them-RRB- so common to those who have, neither in youth nor
in manhood, mixed largely with their kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had listened, day
after day, to Mrs. Hamley's plaintive murmurs as to the deep disgrace
in which Osborne was being held by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father--the prohibition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
coming home; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) hardly knew how to begin to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) that the
letter summoning Osborne had already been sent off.

<p/>Their dinners were tête-à-tête. The Squire tried to make them
pleasant to Molly, feeling deeply grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for the soothing
comfort she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) made merry speeches, which sank
away into silence, and at which they each forgot to smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
ordered up rare wines, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not care for, but tasted out of
complaisance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) noticed that one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had eaten some brown beurré
pears as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) liked them; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) trees had not produced many
this year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) gave directions that this particular kind should be
sought for through the neighbourhood. Molly felt that, in many ways,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was full of good-will towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); but it did not diminish her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
dread of touching on the one sore point in the family. However, it
had to be done, and that without delay.

<p/>The great log was placed on the after-dinner fire, the hearth swept
up, the ponderous candles snuffed, and then the door was shut and
Molly and the Squire were left to their dessert. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sat at the side
of the table in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) old place. That at the head was vacant; yet, as
no orders had been given to the contrary, the plate and glasses and
napkin were always arranged as regularly and methodically as if Mrs.
Hamley would come in as usual. Indeed, sometimes, when the door
by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) used to enter was opened by any chance, Molly caught
herself looking round as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) expected to see the tall, languid
figure in the elegant draperies of rich silk and soft lace, which
Mrs. Hamley was wont to wear of an evening.

<p/>This evening, it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), as a new thought of pain, that into
that room she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) would come no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had fixed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father's
message at this very point of time; but something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) throat
choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) hardly knew how to govern her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) voice. The Squire
got up and went to the broad fireplace, to strike into the middle of
the great log, and split it up into blazing, sparkling pieces. His (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
back was towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>). Molly began, <div class="bookquote">``When papa was here to-day, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
bade me tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had written to Mr. Roger Hamley to say that--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had better come home; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) enclosed a letter to Mr.
Osborne Hamley to say the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire put down the poker, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) still kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) back to Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sent for Osborne and Roger?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) asked, at length.

<p/>Molly answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there was a dead silence, which Molly thought would never end.
The Squire had placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) two hands on the high chimney-piece, and
stood leaning over the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger would have been down from Cambridge on the 18th,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has sent for Osborne, too! Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) know,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) continued,
turning round to Molly, with something of the fierceness she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
anticipated in voice and look. In another moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
voice. <div class="bookquote">``It's right, quite right. I understand. It has come at length.
Come! come! Osborne has brought it on, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a fresh access
of anger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tones. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) might have''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>-LRB-some word Molly could not
hear--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought it sounded like <div class="bookquote">``lingered'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``but for that. I can't
forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); I cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) suddenly left the room. While Molly sat there still, very
sad in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sympathy with all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) head in again:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>), my dear; I cannot--not just yet. But I will soon. Just
this bit; and after that I won't lose a moment. You're a good girl.
God bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It is not to be supposed that Molly had remained all this time at the
Hall without interruption. Once or twice her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
a summons home. Molly thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had brought
it unwillingly; in fact, it was Mrs. Gibson that had sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>),
almost, as it were, to preserve a <div class="bookquote">``right of way''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) actions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall come back to-morrow, or the next day,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) father had
said. <div class="bookquote">``But mamma seems to think people will put a bad construction on
your being so much away from home so soon after our marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, I'm afraid Mrs. Hamley will miss me! I do so like being
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it is likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) will miss you as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) would
have done a month or two ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sleeps so much now, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is
scarcely conscious of the lapse of time. I'll see that you come back
here again in a day or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So out of the silence and the soft melancholy of the Hall Molly
returned into the all-pervading element of chatter and gossip at
Hollingford. Mrs. Gibson received her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) kindly enough. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had a
smart new winter bonnet ready to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) as a present; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did
not care to hear any particulars about the friends whom Molly had
just left; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) few remarks on the state of affairs at the Hall
jarred terribly on the sensitive Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) lingers! Your papa never expected she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) would last
half so long after that attack. It must be very wearing work to them
all; I declare you look quite another creature since you were there.
One can only wish it mayn't last, for their sakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know how the Squire values every minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you say she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sleeps a great deal, and doesn't talk much when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s awake, and there's not the slightest hope for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>). And yet, at
such times, people are kept on the tenter-hooks with watching and
waiting. I know it by my dear Kirkpatrick. There really were days
when I thought it never would end. But we won't talk any more of such
dismal things; you've had quite enough of them, I'm sure, and it
always makes me melancholy to hear of illness and death; and yet your
papa seems sometimes as if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) could talk of nothing else. I'm going
to take you out to-night, though, and that will give you something
of a change; and I've been getting Miss Rose to trim up one of my
old gowns for you; it's too tight for me. There's some talk of
dancing,--it's at Mrs. Edwards'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, I cannot go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>cried Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I've been so much with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edwards</b></font>);
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edwards</b></font>) may be suffering so, or even dying--and I to be dancing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! You're no relation, so you need not feel it so much. I
wouldn't urge you, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Edwards</b></font>) was likely to know about it and be hurt;
but as it is, it's all fixed that you are to go; and don't let us
have any nonsense about it. We might sit twirling our thumbs, and
repeating hymns all our lives long, if we were to do nothing else
when people were dying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>repeated Molly. And, acting upon impulse, and almost
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, who came into the
room at this very time. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) contracted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dark eyebrows, and looked
annoyed as both wife and daughter poured their different sides of the
argument into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat down in desperation of patience. When
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turn came to pronounce a decision, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I can have some lunch? I went away at six this morning,
and there's nothing in the dining-room. I have to go off again
directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly started to the door; Mrs. Gibson made haste to ring the bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going, Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only to see about papa's lunch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are servants to do it; and I don't like your going into the
kitchen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Molly! sit down and be quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``One comes
home wanting peace and quietness--and food too. If I am to be
appealed to, which I beg I may not be another time, I settle that
Molly stops at home this evening. I shall come back late and tired.
See that I have something ready to eat, goosey, and then I'll dress
myself up in my best, and go and fetch you home, my dear. I wish all
these wedding festivities were well over. Ready, is it? Then I'll go
into the dining-room and gorge myself. A doctor ought to be able to
eat like a camel, or like Major Dugald Dalgetty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>It was well for Molly that callers came in just at this time, for
Mrs. Gibson was extremely annoyed. They told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) some little local
piece of news, however, which filled up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind; and Molly found
that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only expressed wonder enough at the engagement they had
both heard of from the departed callers, the previous discussion as
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother or not might be entirely passed
over. Not entirely though; for the next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had to listen to
a very brilliantly touched-up account of the dance and the gaiety
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had missed; and also to be told that Mrs. Gibson had
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind about giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) the gown, and thought now that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) should reserve it for Cynthia, if only it was long enough; but
Cynthia was so tall--quite overgrown, in fact. The chances seemed
equally balanced as to whether Molly might not have the gown after
all.




<p/>CHAPTER XVIII.

<p/>MR. OSBORNE``S SECRET.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>Osborne and Roger came to the Hall; Molly found Roger established
there when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) returned after this absence at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gathered
that Osborne was coming; but very little was said about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in any
way. The Squire scarcely ever left his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife's room; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
watching her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and now and then moaning to himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was so much
under the influence of opiates that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not often rouse up; but
when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) almost invariably asked for Molly. On these rare
occasions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would ask after Osborne--where he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been
told, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was coming? In her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) weakened and confused state of
intellect she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) seemed to have retained two strong impressions--one,
of the sympathy with which Molly had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) confidence about
Osborne; the other, of the anger which her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband entertained
against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Before the squire she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) never mentioned Osborne's name;
nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) seem at her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) ease in speaking about him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) to Roger; while,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was alone with Molly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hardly spoke of any one else.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must have had some sort of wandering idea that Roger blamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
brother, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) remembered Molly's eager defence, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
thought hopelessly improbable at the time. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made
Molly her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) confidante about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) first-born. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to ask Roger
how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would come, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) seemed to know perfectly well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
was coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me all Roger says. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was several days before Molly could ask Roger any questions;
and meanwhile Mrs. Hamley's state had materially altered. At length
Molly came upon Roger sitting in the library, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) footstep till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face, red, and stained with tears, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hair all
ruffled up and in disorder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been wanting to see you alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother does
so want some news of your brother Osborne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) told me last week to
ask you about him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), but I did not like to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) before your
father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) has hardly ever named him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why; for to me she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) used to talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) perpetually. I
have seen so little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) this week, and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) forgets a great
deal now. Still, if you don't mind, I should like to be able to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) something if she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) asks me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head again between his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hands, and did not answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for
some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) want to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), at last. <div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) know that
Osborne is coming soon--any day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) wants to know where he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you. I don't exactly know. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s abroad, but
I'm not sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you've sent papa's letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've sent it to a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) who will know better than I do where
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s to be found. You must know that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) isn't free from creditors,
Molly. You can't have been one of the family, like a child of the
house almost, without knowing that much. For that and for other
reasons I don't exactly know where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) so. You are sure he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite sure. But, Molly, I think my mother may live some time yet;
don't you? Dr. Nicholls said so yesterday when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) was here with
your father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had rallied more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) had ever expected.
You're not afraid of any change that makes you so anxious for
Osborne's coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. It's only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) that I asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) did seem so to crave for
news of him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>). I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) dreamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>); and then when she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) wakened
it was a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) to talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) always seemed to
associate me with him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>). We used to speak so much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) when we were
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what we should any of us have done without you. You've
been like a daughter to my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do so love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, softly.

<p/>``Yes; I see. Have you ever noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sometimes calls you
``Fanny?<div class="bookquote">'' It was the name of a little sister of ours who died. I think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) often takes you for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). It was partly that, and partly that at
such a time as this one can't stand on formalities, that made me call
you Molly. I hope you don't mind it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I like it. But will you tell me something more about your
brother? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) really hungers for news of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d better ask me herself. Yet, no! I am so involved by promises
of secrecy, Molly, that I couldn't satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) once began to
question me. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s in Belgium, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went there about
a fortnight ago, partly to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) creditors. You know my father
has refused to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) debts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: at least, I knew something like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe my father could raise the money all at once without
having recourse to steps which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would exceedingly recoil from. Yet
for the time it places Osborne in a very awkward position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think what vexes your father a good deal is some mystery as to how
the money was spent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If my mother ever says anything about that part of the affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said
Roger, hastily, <div class="bookquote">``assure her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) from me that there's nothing of vice or
wrong-doing about it. I can't say more: I'm tied. But set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind at
ease on that point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembers all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) painful anxiety about this,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to speak a great deal to me about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) before
you came, when your father seemed so angry. And now, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
sees me she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wants to talk on the old subject; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't
remember so clearly. If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would recollect why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was uneasy about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was absent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must be here soon. I expect him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think your father will be very angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly,
with as much timidity as if the squire's displeasure might be
directed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger. <div class="bookquote">``My mother's illness may alter him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); but
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't easily forgive us formerly. I remember once--but that is
nothing to the purpose. I can't help fancying that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has put himself
under some strong restraint for my mother's sake, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't
express much. But it doesn't follow that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will forget it. My father
is a man of few affections, but what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has are very strong; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feels
anything that touches him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on these points deeply and permanently.
That unlucky valuing of the property! It has given my father the idea
of post-obits--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Raising money to be paid on my father's death, which, of course,
involves calculations as to the duration of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How shocking!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm as sure as I am of my own life that Osborne never did anything
of the kind. But my father expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suspicions in language
that irritated Osborne; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't speak out, and won't justify
himself even as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might; and, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loves me, I've but
little influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), or else he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would tell my father all. Well,
we must leave it to time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) added, sighing. <div class="bookquote">``My mother would have
brought us all right, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d been what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) once was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) turned away, leaving Molly very sad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew that every member of
the family she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cared for so much was in trouble, out of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw
no exit; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) small power of helping them was diminishing day by
day as Mrs. Hamley sank more and more under the influence of opiates
and stupefying illness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) only this very
day of the desirableness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) returning home for good. Mrs. Gibson
wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)--for no particular reason, but for many small fragments of
reasons. Mrs. Hamley had ceased to want her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) much, only occasionally
appearing to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) existence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) position -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father
thought--the idea had not entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) head-RRB- in a family of which
the only woman was an invalid confined to bed, was becoming awkward.
But Molly had begged hard to remain two or three days longer--only
that--only till Friday. If Mrs. Hamley should want her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) argued,
with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) eyes-RRB-, and should hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had left the house,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) would think her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) so unkind, so ungrateful!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s getting past wanting any one! The keenness of
earthly feelings is deadened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, that is worst of all. I cannot bear it. I won't believe it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may not ask for me again, and may quite forget me; but I'm sure,
to the very last, if the medicines don't stupefy her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will look
round for the squire and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children. For poor Osborne most of all;
because he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)'s in sorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head, but said nothing in reply. In a minute or
two he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) asked,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like to take you away while you even fancy you can be of use
or comfort to one who has been so kind to you; but, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) hasn't
wanted you before Friday, will you be convinced, will you come home
willingly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I go then, I may see her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) once again, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) hasn't asked for
me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>inquired Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course. You must make no noise, no step; but you may go in
and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>). I must tell you, I'm almost certain she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) won't ask for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) may, papa. I will go home on Friday, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) does not. I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So Molly hung about the house, trying to do all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could out of the
sick-room, for the comfort of those in it. They only came out for
meals, or for necessary business, and found little time for talking
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), so her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life was solitary enough, waiting for the call that
never came. The evening of the day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had had the above
conversation with Roger, Osborne arrived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came straight into
the drawing-room, where Molly was seated on the rug, reading by
firelight, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not like to ring for candles merely for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
own use. Osborne came in, with a kind of hurry, which almost made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) appear as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would trip himself up, and fall down. Molly rose.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) before; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came forwards, and took hold
of both her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands, leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) into the full flickering light, and
straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes to look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)? You will tell me--you must know the truth! I've
travelled day and night since I got your father's letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could frame her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had sate down in the nearest
chair, covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)'s very ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``That you know; but I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
suffers much pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) has wanted you sadly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) groaned aloud. <div class="bookquote">``My father forbade me to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, anxious to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) self-reproach. <div class="bookquote">``Your
brother was away, too. I think no one knew how ill she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was--she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had
been an invalid for so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know-- Yes! she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) told you a great deal--she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was very fond of you.
And God knows how I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>). If I had not been forbidden to come
home, I should have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) all. Does my father know of my coming
now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) papa had sent for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Just at that moment the Squire came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had not heard of Osborne's
arrival, and was seeking Molly to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to write a letter for him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).

<p/>Osborne did not stand up when his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was too much
exhausted, too much oppressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) feelings, and also too much
estranged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father's angry, suspicious letters. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had come
forward with any manifestation of feeling at this moment, everything
might have been different. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) uttered a word. All that the Squire said when his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eye fell
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) at last was,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You here, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And, breaking off in the directions he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was giving to Molly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
abruptly left the room. All the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heart was yearning after his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
first-born; but mutual pride kept them asunder. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) went straight
to the butler, and asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) when Mr. Osborne had arrived, and how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had come, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had had any refreshment--dinner or what--since
his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) arrival?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For I think I forget everything now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the poor Squire, putting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``For the life of me, I can't remember
whether we've had dinner or not; these long nights, and all this
sorrow and watching, quite bewilder me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, sir, you will take some dinner with Mr. Osborne. Mrs.
Morgan is sending up his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) directly. You hardly sate down at
dinner-time, sir, you thought my mistress wanted something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! I remember now. No! I won't have any more. Give Mr. Osborne what
wine he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) chooses. Perhaps _he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)_ can eat and drink.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>So the Squire went
away upstairs with bitterness as well as sorrow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heart.

<p/>When lights were brought, Molly was struck with the change in
Osborne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) looked haggard and worn; perhaps with travelling and
anxiety. Not quite such a dainty gentleman either, as Molly had
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had last seen him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother,
two months before. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) better now. The tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
remarks pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) more. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was simpler, and less ashamed of showing
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked after Roger in a warm, longing kind of way.
Roger was out: he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had ridden to Ashcombe to transact some business
for the Squire. Osborne evidently wished for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) return; and hung
about restlessly in the drawing-room after he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had dined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're sure I mayn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) asked Molly, for the
third or fourth time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. I will go up again if you like it. But Mrs. Jones, the
nurse Dr. Nicholls sent, is a very decided person. I went up while
you were at dinner, and Mrs. Hamley had just taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) drops, and was
on no account to be disturbed by seeing any one, much less by any
excitement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne kept walking up and down the long drawing-room, half talking
to himself, half to Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Roger would come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) seems to be the only one to give me a
welcome. Does my father always live upstairs in my mother's rooms,
Miss Gibson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has done since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) last attack. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reproaches himself
for not having been enough alarmed before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You heard all the words he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said to me; they were not much of a
welcome, were they? And my dear mother, who always--whether I was to
blame or not--I suppose Roger is sure to come home to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are staying here, are you not? Do you often see my mother, or
does this omnipotent nurse keep you out too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Hamley hasn't asked for me for three days now, and I don't go
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) room unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) asks. I'm leaving on Friday, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother was very fond of you, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said, in a voice that had a great deal of sensitive
pain in its tone,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose--do you know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is quite conscious--quite
herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always conscious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has to take so
many opiates. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never wanders, only forgets, and sleeps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), stopping suddenly, and hanging over
the fire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands on the chimney-piece.

<p/>When Roger came home, Molly thought it time to retire. Poor girl!
it was getting to be time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to leave this scene of distress
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could be of no use. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sobbed herself to sleep this
Tuesday night. Two days more, and it would be Friday; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would
have to wrench up the roots she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had shot down into this ground. The
weather was bright the next morning; and morning and sunny weather
cheer up young hearts. Molly sate in the dining-room making tea for
the gentlemen as they came down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not help hoping that the
Squire and Osborne might come to a better understanding before she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
left; for after all, in the dissension between father and son, lay a
bitterer sting than in the illness sent by God. But though they met
at the breakfast-table, they purposely avoided addressing each other.
Perhaps the natural subject of conversation between the two, at such
a time, would have been Osborne's long journey the night before; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had never spoken of the place he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had come from, whether north,
south, east, or west, and the Squire did not choose to allude to
anything that might bring out what his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son wished to conceal. Again,
there was an unexpressed idea in both their minds that Mrs. Hamley's
present illness was much aggravated, if not entirely brought on, by
the discovery of Osborne's debts; so, many inquiries and answers on
that head were tabooed. In fact, their attempts at easy conversation
were limited to local subjects, and principally addressed to Molly
or Roger. Such intercourse was not productive of pleasure, or even
of friendly feeling, though there was a thin outward surface of
politeness and peace. Long before the day was over, Molly wished that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had acceded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's proposal, and gone home with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
No one seemed to want her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Mrs. Jones, the nurse, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) time
after time that Mrs. Hamley had never named her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) name; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) small
services in the sick-room were not required since there was a regular
nurse. Osborne and Roger seemed all in all to each other; and Molly
now felt how much the short conversations she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had had with Roger had
served to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) something to think about, all during the remainder
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) solitary days. Osborne was extremely polite, and even
expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) gratitude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) attentions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother in
a very pleasant manner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) appeared to be unwilling to show
her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) any of the deeper feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) heart, and almost ashamed of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) exhibition of emotion the night before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) as any
agreeable young man speaks to any pleasant young lady; but Molly
almost resented this. It was only the Squire who seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
of any account. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) letters to write, small bills to reckon
up; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could have kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands for thankfulness.

<p/>The last afternoon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stay at the Hall came. Roger had gone out
on the Squire's business. Molly went into the garden, thinking over
the last summer, when Mrs. Hamley's sofa used to be placed under
the old cedar-tree on the lawn, and when the warm air seemed to be
scented with roses and sweetbriar. Now, the trees leafless, there was
no sweet odour in the keen frosty air; and looking up at the house,
there were the white sheets of blinds, shutting out the pale winter
sky from the invalid's room. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thought of the day her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father
had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) second marriage: the thicket was
tangled with dead weeds and rime and hoar-frost; and the beautiful
fine articulations of branches and boughs and delicate twigs were
all intertwined in leafless distinctness against the sky. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
ever be so passionately unhappy again? Was it goodness, or was it
numbness, that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) feel as though life was too short to be
troubled much about anything? Death seemed the only reality. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had
neither energy nor heart to walk far or briskly; and turned back
towards the house. The afternoon sun was shining brightly on the
windows; and, stirred up to unusual activity by some unknown cause,
the housemaids had opened the shutters and windows of the generally
unused library. The middle window was also a door; the white-painted
wood went halfway up. Molly turned along the little flag-paved path
that led past the library windows to the gate in the white railings
at the front of the house, and went in at the opened door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
had leave given to choose out any books she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wished to read, and to
take them home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and it was just the sort of half-dawdling
employment suited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) taste this afternoon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mounted on the
ladder to get to a particular shelf high up in a dark corner of the
room; and finding there some volume that looked interesting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sat
down on the step to read part of it. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sat, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bonnet and
cloak, when Osborne suddenly came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) at first;
indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) seemed in such a hurry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) probably might not have
noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) at all, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had not spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I in your way? I only came here for a minute to look for some
books.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) came down the steps as she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) spoke, still holding the book
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. It is I who am disturbing you. I must just write a
letter for the post, and then I shall be gone. Is not this open door
too cold for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no. It is so fresh and pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) began to read again, sitting on the lowest step of the ladder;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to write at the large old-fashioned writing-table close to the
window. There was a minute or two of profound silence, in which the
rapid scratching of Osborne's pen upon the paper was the only sound.
Then came a click of the gate, and Roger stood at the open door. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
face was towards Osborne, sitting in the light; his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) back to Molly,
crouched up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) corner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) held out a letter, and said in hoarse
breathlessness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a letter from your wife, Osborne. I went past the post-office
and thought--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne stood up, angry dismay upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger! what have you done! Don't you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger looked round, and Molly stood up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) corner, red, trembling,
miserable, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were a guilty person. Roger entered the
room. All three seemed to be equally dismayed. Molly was the first to
speak; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came forward and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry! I didn't wish to hear it, but I couldn't help it. You
will trust me, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and turning to Roger she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) with
tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes--<div class="bookquote">``Please say you know I shall not tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``Only Roger, who knew
of what importance it was, ought to have looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) before
speaking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I should,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger. <div class="bookquote">``I'm more vexed with myself than you can
conceive. Not but what I'm as sure of you as of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), turning to Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, <div class="bookquote">``you see how many chances there are
that even the best-meaning persons may let out what it is of such
consequence to me to keep secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you think it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't let us begin that old discussion again--at any rate,
before a third person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had had hard work all this time to keep from crying. Now that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was alluded to as the third person before whom conversation was
to be restrained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going away. Perhaps I ought not to have been here. I'm very
sorry--very. But I'll try and forget what I've heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, still ungraciously. <div class="bookquote">``But will you
promise me never to speak about it to any one--not even to me, or to
Roger? Will you try to act and speak as if you had never heard it?
I'm sure, from what Roger has told me about you, that if you give me
this promise I may rely upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I will promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand as a kind of
pledge. Osborne took it, but rather as if the action was superfluous.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I think I should have done so, even without a promise.
But it is, perhaps, better to bind oneself. I will go away now. I
wish I'd never come into this room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) book on the table very softly, and turned to leave
the room, choking down her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) tears until she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was in the solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
own chamber. But Roger was at the door before her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>), holding it open
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>), and reading--she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was reading--her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) held
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hand for hers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) firm grasp expressed both sympathy and
regret for what had occurred.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) could hardly keep back her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) sobs till she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) bedroom. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
feelings had been overwrought for some time past, without finding the
natural vent in action. The leaving Hamley Hall had seemed so sad
before; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was troubled with having to bear away a secret
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) ought never to have known, and the knowledge of which had
brought out a very uncomfortable responsibility. Then there would
arise a very natural wonder as to who Osborne's wife was. Molly had
not stayed so long and so intimately in the Hamley family without
being well aware of the manner in which the future lady of Hamley was
planned for. The Squire, for instance, partly in order to show that
Osborne, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heir, was above the reach of Molly Gibson, the doctor's
daughter, in the early days before he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) knew Molly well, had often
alluded to the grand, the high, and the wealthy marriage which Hamley
of Hamley, as represented by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) clever, brilliant, handsome son
Osborne, might be expected to make. Mrs. Hamley, too, unconsciously
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) part, showed the projects that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was constantly devising for
the reception of the unknown daughter-in-law that was to be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The drawing-room must be refurnished when Osborne marries'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--or
<div class="bookquote">``Osborne's wife will like to have the west suite of rooms to herself;
it will perhaps be a trial to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) to live with the old couple; but we
must arrange it so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) will feel it as little as possible.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Of
course, when Mrs. Osborne comes we must try and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) a new
carriage; the old one does well enough for us.'' (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>--These, and similar
speeches had given Molly the impression of the future Mrs. Osborne as
of some beautiful grand young lady, whose very presence would make
the old Hall into a stately, formal mansion, instead of the pleasant,
unceremonious home that it was at present. Osborne, too, who had
spoken with such languid criticism to Mrs. Gibson about various
country belles, and even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) own home was apt to give himself
airs--only at home his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) airs were poetically fastidious, while with
Mrs. Gibson they had been socially fastidious--what unspeakably
elegant beauty had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) chosen for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) wife? Who had satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>); and
yet satisfying him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), had to have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marriage kept in concealment from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) parents? At length Molly tore herself up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wonderings. It
was of no use: she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not find out; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might not even try. The
blank wall of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) promise blocked up the way. Perhaps it was not even
right to wonder, and endeavour to remember slight speeches, casual
mentions of a name, so as to piece them together into something
coherent. Molly dreaded seeing either of the brothers again; but they
all met at dinner-time as if nothing had happened. The Squire was
taciturn, either from melancholy or displeasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had never spoken
to Osborne since his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) return, excepting about the commonest trifles,
when intercourse could not be avoided; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife's state oppressed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) like a heavy cloud coming over the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) day. Osborne put
on an indifferent manner to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father, which Molly felt sure was
assumed; but it was not conciliatory for all that. Roger, quiet,
steady, and natural, talked more than all the others; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) too
was uneasy, and in distress on many accounts. To-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) principally
addressed himself to Molly; entering into rather long narrations of
late discoveries in natural history, which kept up the current of
talk without requiring much reply from any one. Molly had expected
Osborne to look something different from usual--conscious, or
ashamed, or resentful, or even <div class="bookquote">``married'' (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was exactly the
Osborne of the morning--handsome, elegant, languid in manner and in
look; cordial with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother, polite towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>), secretly uneasy
at the state of things between his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father and himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) would
never have guessed the concealed romance which lay _perdu_ under
that every-day behaviour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had always wished to come into direct
contact with a love-story: here she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) only found it very
uncomfortable; there was a sense of concealment and uncertainty about
it all; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) honest straightforward father, her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) quiet life at
Hollingford, which, even with all its drawbacks, was above-board,
and where everybody knew what everybody was doing, seemed secure and
pleasant in comparison. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) felt great pain at quitting
the Hall, and at the mute farewell she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had taken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) sleeping
and unconscious friend. But leaving Mrs. Hamley now was a different
thing to what it had been a fortnight ago. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was wanted at any
moment, and felt herself to be of comfort. Now her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) very existence
seemed forgotten by the poor lady whose body appeared to be living so
long after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) soul.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was sent home in the carriage, loaded with true thanks from every
one of the family. Osborne ransacked the greenhouses for flowers for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>); Roger had chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) out books of every kind. The Squire himself
kept shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) hand, without being able to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) gratitude,
till at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) arms, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would have
done a daughter.




<p/>CHAPTER XIX.

<p/>CYNTHIA``S ARRIVAL.


<p/>Molly's father was not at home when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) returned; and there was no
one to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a welcome. Mrs. Gibson was out paying calls, the
servants told Molly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own room, meaning to
unpack and arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) borrowed books. Rather to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) surprise she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw
the chamber, corresponding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own, being dusted; water and towels
too were being carried in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is any one coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>CYNTHIA</b></font>) asked of the housemaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Missus's daughter from France. Miss Kirkpatrick is coming
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Was Cynthia coming at last? Oh, what a pleasure it would be to have a
companion, a girl, a sister of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own age! Molly's depressed spirits
sprang up again with bright elasticity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) longed for Mrs. Gibson's
return, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) all about it: it must be very sudden, for Mr.
Gibson had said nothing of it at the Hall the day before. No quiet
reading now; the books were hardly put away with Molly's usual
neatness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went down into the drawing-room, and could not settle
to anything. At last Mrs. Gibson came home, tired out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) walk
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heavy velvet cloak. Until that was taken off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
rested herself for a few minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) seemed quite unable to attend
to Molly's questions.

<p/>``Oh, yes! Cynthia is coming home to-morrow, by the ``Umpire,<div class="bookquote">'' which
passes through at ten o'clock. What an oppressive day it is for the
time of the year! I really am almost ready to faint. Cynthia heard of
some opportunity, I believe, and was only too glad to leave school a
fortnight earlier than we planned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) never gave me the chance of
writing to say I did, or did not, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) coming so much before the
time; and I shall have to pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) just the same as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
stopped. And I meant to have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to bring me a French bonnet;
and then you could have had one made after mine. But I'm very glad
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s coming, poor dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Umpire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is anything the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! Why should there be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You called her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) `poor dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and it made me afraid lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might be
ill.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! It's only a way I got into, when Mr. Kirkpatrick died. A
fatherless girl--you know one always does call them `poor dears.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh,
no! Cynthia never is ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s as strong as a horse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) never would
have felt to-day as I have done. Could you get me a glass of wine and
a biscuit, my dear? I'm really quite faint.''

<p/>Mr. Gibson was much more excited about Cynthia's arrival than her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
own mother was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) anticipated her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) coming as a great pleasure to
Molly, on whom, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) recent marriage and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) new wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
interests principally centred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) even found time to run upstairs and
see the bedrooms of the two girls; for the furniture of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
paid a pretty round sum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose young ladies like their bedrooms decked out in this
way! It's very pretty certainly, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I liked my own old room better, papa; but perhaps Cynthia is
accustomed to such decking up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps; at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'ll see we've tried to make it pretty.
Yours is like hers. That's right. It might have hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), if hers had
been smarter than yours. Now, good-night in your fine flimsy bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was up betimes--almost before it was light--arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
pretty Hamley flowers in Cynthia's room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could hardly eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
breakfast that morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ran upstairs and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) things,
thinking that Mrs. Gibson was quite sure to go down to the <div class="bookquote">``George
Inn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>where the <div class="bookquote">``Umpire''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>stopped, to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter after a two
years' absence. But, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) surprise, Mrs. Gibson had arranged
herself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) great worsted-work frame, just as usual; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) turn, was astonished at Molly's bonnet and cloak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going so early, child? The fog hasn't cleared away
yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you would go and meet Cynthia; and I wanted to go with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) will be here in half an hour; and dear papa has told the
gardener to take the wheelbarrow down for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) luggage. I'm not sure
if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is not gone himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then are not you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, with a good deal of
disappointment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, certainly not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) will be here almost directly. And, besides,
I don't like to expose my feelings to every passer-by in High Street.
You forget I have not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) for two years, and I hate scenes in
the market-place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) settled herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) work again; and Molly, after some
consideration, gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own going, and employed herself in looking
out of the downstairs window which commanded the approach from the
town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is--here she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cried out at last. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father was
walking by the side of a tall young lady; William the gardener
was wheeling along a great cargo of baggage. Molly flew to the
front-door, and had it wide open to admit the new-comer some time
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arrived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! here she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is. Molly, this is Cynthia. Cynthia, Molly. You're to
be sisters, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly saw the beautiful, tall, swaying figure, against the light of
the open door, but could not see any of the features that were, for
the moment, in shadow. A sudden gush of shyness had come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
just at the instant, and quenched the embrace she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have given a
moment before. But Cynthia took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) arms, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) on
both cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said, looking beyond Molly on to the stairs where
Mrs. Gibson stood, wrapped up in a shawl, and shivering in the cold.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ran past Molly and Mr. Gibson, who rather averted their eyes from
this first greeting between mother and child.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how you are grown, darling! You look quite a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``I was before I went away; I've hardly
grown since,--except, it is always to be hoped, in wisdom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! That we will hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, in rather a meaning
way. Indeed there were evidently hidden allusions in their seeming
commonplace speeches. When they all came into the full light and
repose of the drawing-room, Molly was absorbed in the contemplation
of Cynthia's beauty. Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) features were not regular; but the
changes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) expressive countenance gave one no time to think of
that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) smile was perfect; her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pouting charming; the play of the
face was in the mouth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes were beautifully shaped, but their
expression hardly seemed to vary. In colouring she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was not unlike
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother; only she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had not so much of the red-haired tints in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
complexion; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) long-shaped, serious grey eyes were fringed with
dark lashes, instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's insipid flaxen ones. Molly fell
in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), so to speak, on the instant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sate there warming
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) feet and hands, as much at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ease as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been there all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life; not particularly attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother--who, all the
time, was studying either her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dress--measuring Molly and Mr.
Gibson with grave observant looks, as if guessing how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should like
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's hot breakfast ready for you in the dining-room, when you are
ready for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you must want it after your
night journey.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) looked round at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife, at Cynthia's mother, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not seem inclined to leave the warm room again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly will take you to your room, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it is near
hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has got her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) things to take off. I'll come down and sit
in the dining-room while you are having your breakfast, but I really
am afraid of the cold now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia rose and followed Molly upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so sorry there isn't a fire for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``but--I
suppose it wasn't ordered; and, of course, I don't give any orders.
Here is some hot water, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, getting hold of both Molly's hands,
and looking steadily into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face, but in such a manner that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did
not dislike the inspection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall like you. I am so glad! I was afraid I should not.
We're all in a very awkward position together, aren't we? I like your
father's looks, though.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: FIRST IMPRESSIONS.-RSB-


<p/>Molly could not help smiling at the way this was said. Cynthia
replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you may laugh. But I don't know that I am easy to get on with;
mamma and I didn't suit when we were last together. But perhaps we
are each of us wiser now. Now, please leave me for a quarter of an
hour. I don't want anything more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own room, waiting to show Cynthia down to the
dining-room. Not that, in the moderate-sized house, there was any
difficulty in finding the way. A very little trouble in conjecturing
would enable a stranger to discover any room. But Cynthia had
so captivated Molly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wanted to devote herself to the
new-comer's service. Ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had heard of the probability
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) having a sister---LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a sister, but whether it was
a Scotch sister, or a sister _à la mode de Brétagne_, would have
puzzled most people-RRB---Molly had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fancy to dwell much on
the idea of Cynthia's coming; and in the short time since they had
met, Cynthia's unconscious power of fascination had been exercised
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Some people have this power. Of course, its effects are
only manifested in the susceptible. A school-girl may be found in
every school who attracts and influences all the others, not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
virtues, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) beauty, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sweetness, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cleverness, but
by something that can neither be described nor reasoned upon. It is
the something alluded to in the old lines:--

<p/>Love me not for comely grace,
For my pleasing eye and face;
No, nor for my constant heart,--
For these may change, and turn to ill,
And thus true love may sever.
But love me on, and know not why,
So hast thou the same reason still
To dote upon me ever.

<p/>A woman will have this charm, not only over men but over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
sex; it cannot be defined, or rather it is so delicate a mixture
of many gifts and qualities that it is impossible to decide on the
proportions of each. Perhaps it is incompatible with very high
principle; as its essence seems to consist in the most exquisite
power of adaptation to varying people and still more various moods;
<div class="bookquote">``being all things to all men.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>At any rate, Molly might soon have
been aware that Cynthia was not remarkable for unflinching morality;
but the glamour thrown over her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would have prevented Molly from any
attempt at penetrating into and judging her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) companion's character,
even had such processes been the least in accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
disposition.

<p/>Cynthia was very beautiful, and was so well aware of this fact that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had forgotten to care about it; no one with such loveliness ever
appeared so little conscious of it. Molly would watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) perpetually
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) moved about the room, with the free stately step of some wild
animal of the forest--moving almost, as it were, to the continual
sound of music. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dress, too, though now to our ideas it would
be considered ugly and disfiguring, was suited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) complexion
and figure, and the fashion of it subdued within due bounds by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
exquisite taste. It was inexpensive enough, and the changes in it
were but few. Mrs. Gibson professed herself shocked to find that
Cynthia had but four gowns, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) might have stocked herself so
well, and brought over so many useful French patterns, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had but
patiently waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother's answer to the letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
sent, announcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) return by the opportunity madame had found for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Molly was hurt for Cynthia at all these speeches; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought
they implied that the pleasure which her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother felt in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a
fortnight sooner after her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) two years' absence was inferior to that
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have received from a bundle of silver-paper patterns.
But Cynthia took no apparent notice of the frequent recurrence of
these small complaints. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) received much of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother
said with a kind of complete indifference, that made Mrs. Gibson hold
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rather in awe; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was much more communicative to Molly than
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own child. With regard to dress, however, Cynthia soon showed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother's own daughter in the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
could use her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) deft and nimble fingers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was a capital workwoman;
and, unlike Molly, who excelled in plain sewing, but had no notion of
dressmaking or millinery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could repeat the fashions she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had only
seen in passing along the streets of Boulogne, with one or two pretty
rapid movements of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) turned and twisted the ribbons
and gauze her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother furnished her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) refurbished Mrs.
Gibson's wardrobe; doing it all in a sort of contemptuous manner, the
source of which Molly could not quite make out.

<p/>Day after day the course of these small frivolities was broken in
upon by the news Mr. Gibson brought of Mrs. Hamley's nearer approach
to death. Molly--very often sitting by Cynthia, and surrounded by
ribbon, and wire, and net--heard the bulletins like the toll of a
funeral bell at a marriage feast. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father sympathized with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). It
was the loss of a dear friend to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) too; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was so accustomed to
death, that it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) but as it was, the natural end of all
things human. To Molly, the death of some one she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had known so well
and loved so much, was a sad and gloomy phenomenon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) loathed the
small vanities with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was surrounded, and would wander out
into the frosty garden, and pace the walk, which was both sheltered
and concealed by evergreens.

<p/>At length--and yet it was not so long, not a fortnight since Molly
had left the Hall--the end came. Mrs. Hamley had sunk out of life as
gradually as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had sunk out of consciousness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) place in this
world. The quiet waves closed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) place knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) no
more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They all sent their love to you, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Roger
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knew how you would feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson had come in very late, and was having a solitary dinner
in the dining-room. Molly was sitting near him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) company.
Cynthia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother were upstairs. The latter was trying on a
head-dress which Cynthia had made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).

<p/>Molly remained downstairs after her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father had gone out afresh on
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) final round among his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) town patients. The fire was growing very
low, and the lights were waning. Cynthia came softly in, and taking
Molly's listless hand, that hung down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) side, sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) feet
on the rug, chafing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) chilly fingers without speaking. The tender
action thawed the tears that had been gathering heavily at Molly's
heart, and they came dropping down her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dearly, did you not, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>sobbed Molly; and then there was a silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you known her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not a year. But I had seen a great deal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). I was almost
like a daughter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said so. Yet I never bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) good-by, or
anything. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind became weak and confused.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had only sons, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No; only Mr. Osborne and Mr. Roger Hamley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had a daughter
once--``Fanny.<div class="bookquote">'' Sometimes, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) illness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) used to call me
`Fanny.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>The two girls were silent for some time, both gazing into the fire.
Cynthia spoke first:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could love people as you do, Molly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. A good number of people love me, I believe, or at least they
think they do; but I never seem to care much for any one. I do
believe I love you, little Molly, whom I have only known for ten
days, better than any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not than your mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in grave astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, than my mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>replied Cynthia, half-smiling. <div class="bookquote">``It's very
shocking, I daresay; but it is so. Now, don't go and condemn me. I
don't think love for one's mother quite comes by nature; and remember
how much I have been separated from mine! I loved my father, if you
will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) continued, with the force of truth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tone, and then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stopped; ``but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died when I was quite a little thing, and no one
believes that I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I heard mamma say to a caller, not a
fortnight after his (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>) funeral, ``Oh, no, Cynthia is too young; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has
quite forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>caller</b></font>)'--and I bit my lips, to keep from crying out,
<div class="bookquote">``Papa! papa! have I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But it's of no use. Well, then mamma had to go
out as a governess; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) couldn't help it, poor thing! but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) didn't
much care for parting with me. I was a trouble, I daresay. So I was
sent to school at four years old; first one school, and then another;
and in the holidays, mamma went to stay at grand houses, and I was
generally left with the schoolmistresses. Once I went to the Towers;
and mamma lectured me continually, and yet I was very naughty, I
believe. And so I never went again; and I was very glad of it, for it
was a horrid place.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That it was!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, who remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own day of tribulation
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And once I went to London, to stay with my uncle Kirkpatrick. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is
a lawyer, and getting on now; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was poor enough, and had
six or seven children. It was winter-time, and we were all shut up in
a small house in Doughty Street. But, after all, that wasn't so bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then you lived with your mother when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began school at
Ashcombe. Mr. Preston told me that, when I stayed that day at the
Manor-house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Cynthia, almost fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but that. Oh, yes! He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) praised your beauty, and wanted me to
tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have hated you if you had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I never thought of doing such a thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>replied Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I
didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); and Lady Harriet spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) the next day, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
wasn't a person to be liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia was quite silent. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, simply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was thinking again of Mrs.
Hamley,--

<p/>Only the actions of the just
Smell sweet and blossom in the dust,

<p/>and <div class="bookquote">``goodness''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>just then seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to be the only enduring thing
in the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Molly! You are good. At least, if you're not good, what
am I? There's a rule-of-three sum for you to do! But it's no use
talking; I am not good, and I never shall be now. Perhaps I might be
a heroine still, but I shall never be a good woman, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think it easier to be a heroine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, as far as one knows of heroines from history. I'm capable of a
great jerk, an effort, and then a relaxation--but steady, every-day
goodness is beyond me. I must be a moral kangaroo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly could not follow Cynthia's ideas; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not distract
herself from the thoughts of the sorrowing group at the Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I should like to see them all! and yet one can do nothing at
such a time! Papa says the funeral is to be on Tuesday, and that,
after that, Roger Hamley is to go back to Cambridge. It will seem
as if nothing had happened! I wonder how the squire and Mr. Osborne
Hamley will get on together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s the eldest son, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) not? Why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father get
on well together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I don't know. That is to say, I do know, but I think I ought not
to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Don't be so pedantically truthful, Molly. Besides, your manner shows
when you speak truth and when you speak falsehood, without troubling
yourself to use words. I knew exactly what your <div class="bookquote">``I don't know' meant.
I never consider myself bound to be truthful, so I beg we may be on
equal terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia might well say she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not consider herself bound to be
truthful; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) literally said what came uppermost, without caring very
much whether it was accurate or not. But there was no ill-nature,
and, in a general way, no attempt at procuring any advantage for
herself in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) deviations; and there was often such a latent
sense of fun in them that Molly could not help being amused with them
in fact, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) condemned them in theory. Cynthia's playfulness
of manner glossed such failings over with a kind of charm; and yet,
at times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was so soft and sympathetic that Molly could not resist
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) affirmed the most startling things. The little
account she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own beauty pleased Mr. Gibson extremely; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty deference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) won his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was restless too, till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had attacked Molly's dress, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had remodelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
mother's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now for you, sweet one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began upon one of Molly's
gowns. <div class="bookquote">``I've been working as connoisseur until now; now I begin as
amateur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) brought down her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty artificial flowers, plucked out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
own best bonnet to put into Molly's, saying they would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
complexion, and that a knot of ribbons would do well enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).
All the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) worked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sang; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had a sweet voice in singing,
as well as in speaking, and used to run up and down her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gay French
_chansons_ without any difficulty; so flexible in the art was she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).
Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not seem to care for music. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) rarely touched the piano,
on which Molly practised with daily conscientiousness. Cynthia was
always willing to answer questions about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) previous life, though,
after the first, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) rarely alluded to it of herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was a
most sympathetic listener to all Molly's innocent confidences of joys
and sorrows: sympathizing even to the extent of wondering how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
could endure Mr. Gibson's second marriage, and why she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not take
some active steps of rebellion.

<p/>In spite of all this agreeable and pungent variety of companionship
at home, Molly yearned after the Hamleys. If there had been a woman
in that family she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would probably have received many little notes,
and heard numerous details which were now lost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), or summed
up in condensed accounts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's visits at the Hall, which,
since his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dear patient was dead, were only occasional.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! The Squire is a good deal changed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)'s better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was.
There's an unspoken estrangement between him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) and Osborne; one can
see it in the silence and constraint of their manners; but outwardly
they are friendly--civil at any rate. The squire will always respect
Osborne as his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) heir, and the future representative of the family.
Osborne doesn't look well; he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) wants change. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)'s
weary of the domestic dullness, or domestic dissension. But he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) feels
his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) mother's death acutely. It's a wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) father are
not drawn together by their common loss. Roger's away at Cambridge
too--examination for the mathematical tripos. Altogether the aspect
of both people and place is changed; it is but natural!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hamleys/Mr. Hamleys</b></font>)</div><p/>Such is perhaps the summing-up of the news of the Hamleys, as
contained in many bulletins. They always ended in some kind message
to Molly.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson generally said, as a comment upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband's account
of Osborne's melancholy,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear! why don't you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to dinner here? A little quiet
dinner, you know. Cook is quite up to it; and we would all of us wear
blacks and lilacs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) couldn't consider that as gaiety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson took no more notice of these suggestions than by shaking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had grown accustomed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife by this time, and
regarded silence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own part as a great preservative against long
inconsequential arguments. But every time that Mrs. Gibson was struck
by Cynthia's beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought it more and more advisable that Mr.
Osborne Hamley should be cheered up by a quiet little dinner-party.
As yet no one but the ladies of Hollingford and Mr. Ashton, the
vicar--that hopeless and impracticable old bachelor--had seen
Cynthia; and what was the good of having a lovely daughter, if there
were none but old women to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)?

<p/>Cynthia herself appeared extremely indifferent upon the subject,
and took very little notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother's constant talk about the
gaieties that were possible, and the gaieties that were impossible,
in Hollingford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) exerted herself just as much to charm the two
Miss Brownings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would have done to delight Osborne Hamley,
or any other young heir. That is to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) used no exertion, but
simply followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own nature, which was to attract every one of
those she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was thrown amongst. The exertion seemed rather to be
to refrain from doing so, and to protest, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) often did, by
slight words and expressive looks against her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother's words and
humours--alike against her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) folly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) caresses. Molly was almost
sorry for Mrs. Gibson, who seemed so unable to gain influence over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) child. One day Cynthia read Molly's thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not good, and I told you so. Somehow, I cannot forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>blacks</b></font>)
for her (<font color='blue'><b>blacks</b></font>) neglect of me as a child, when I would have clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>blacks</b></font>).
Besides, I hardly ever heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>blacks</b></font>) when I was at school. And I
know she (<font color='blue'><b>blacks</b></font>) put a stop to my coming over to her (<font color='blue'><b>blacks</b></font>) wedding. I saw the
letter she (<font color='blue'><b>blacks</b></font>) wrote to Madame Lefevre. A child should be brought up with
its parents, if it is to think them infallible when it grows up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But though it may know that there must be faults,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>replied Molly,
<div class="bookquote">``it ought to cover them over and try to forget their existence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XX.

<p/>MRS. GIBSON``S VISITORS.


<p/>One day, to Molly's infinite surprise, Mr. Preston was announced
as a caller. Mrs. Gibson and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) were sitting together in the
drawing-room; Cynthia was out--gone into the town a-shopping--when
the door was opened, the name given, and in walked the young man. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
entrance seemed to cause more confusion than Molly could well account
for. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came in with the same air of easy assurance with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father at Ashcombe Manor-house. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked
remarkably handsome in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) riding-dress, and with the open-air
exercise he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just had. But Mrs. Gibson's smooth brows contracted a
little at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reception of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was much cooler
than that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usually gave to visitors. Yet there was a degree
of agitation in it, which surprised Molly a little. Mrs. Gibson was
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) everlasting worsted-work frame when Mr. Preston entered the
room; but somehow in rising to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) threw down her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) basket
of crewels, and, declining Molly's offer to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would pick
up all the reels herself, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) visitor to sit down.
He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) stood there, hat in hand, affecting an interest in the recovery of
the worsted which Molly was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) did not feel; for all the time
his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) eyes were glancing round the room, and taking note of the details
in the arrangement.

<p/>At length they were seated, and conversation began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the first time I have been in Hollingford since your marriage,
Mrs. Gibson, or I should certainly have called to pay my respects
sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you are very busy at Ashcombe. I did not expect you to call.
Is Lord Cumnor at the Towers? I have not heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ladyship for
more than a week!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) seemed still detained at Bath. But I had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
giving me certain messages for Mr. Sheepshanks. Mr. Gibson is not at
home, I'm afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is a great deal out--almost constantly, I may say. I had no
idea that I should see so little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). A doctor's wife leads a very
solitary life, Mr. Preston!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can hardly call it solitary, I should think, when you have such
a companion as Miss Gibson always at hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), bowing to Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but I call it solitude for a wife when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband is away. Poor
Mr. Kirkpatrick was never happy unless I always went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>);--all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) walks, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) visits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) liked me to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>). But, somehow,
Mr. Gibson feels as if I should be rather in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you could ride pillion behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) on Black Bess,
mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``And unless you could do that, you could hardly
go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rounds up and down all the rough lanes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh! but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might keep a brougham! I've often said so. And then I
could use it for visiting in the evenings. Really it was one reason
why I didn't go to the Hollingford Charity Ball. I couldn't bring
myself to use the dirty fly from the ``George.<div class="bookquote">'' We really must stir
papa up against next winter, Molly; it will never do for you and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George du Maurier</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pulled herself up suddenly, and looked furtively at Mr. Preston
to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had taken any notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) abruptness. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
had, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was not going to show it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) turned to Molly, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever been to a public ball yet, Miss Gibson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a great pleasure to you when the time comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure. I shall like it if I have plenty of partners; but I'm
afraid I shan't know many people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you suppose that young men haven't their own ways and means of
being introduced to pretty girls?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>It was exactly one of the speeches Molly had disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) for before;
and delivered, too, in that kind of underbred manner which showed
that it was meant to convey a personal compliment. Molly took great
credit to herself for the unconcerned manner with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went on
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tatting exactly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had never heard it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only hope I may be one of your partners at the first ball you go
to. Pray, remember my early application for that honour, when you are
overwhelmed with requests for dances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't choose to engage myself beforehand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, perceiving,
from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dropped eyelids, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was leaning forward and
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was determined to have an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young ladies are always very cautious in fact, however modest they
may be in profession,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) replied, addressing himself in a nonchalant
manner to Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``In spite of Miss Gibson's apprehension of not
having many partners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) declines the certainty of having one. I
suppose Miss Kirkpatrick will have returned from France before then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) said these last words exactly in the same tone as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had used
before; but Molly's instinct told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was making an effort to
do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) hat, almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
did not care to have any answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) question. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was listening
acutely, and with a half smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) face.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson reddened a little, and hesitated,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; certainly. My daughter will be with us next winter, I believe;
and I daresay she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will go out with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) say at once that Cynthia is here now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly of
herself, yet glad that Mr. Preston's curiosity was baffled.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) still smiled; but this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) looked up at Mrs. Gibson, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
asked,--<div class="bookquote">``You have good news from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; very. By the way, how are our old friends the Robinsons? How
often I think of their kindness to me at Ashcombe! Dear good people,
I wish I could see them again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will certainly tell them of your kind inquiries. They are very
well, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Just at this moment, Molly heard the familiar sound of the click
and opening of the front door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew it must be Cynthia; and,
conscious of some mysterious reason which made Mrs. Gibson wish to
conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter's whereabouts from Mr. Preston, and maliciously
desirous to baffle him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rose to leave the room, and meet Cynthia
on the stairs; but one of the lost crewels of worsted had entangled
itself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) gown and feet, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had freed herself of the
encumbrance, Cynthia had opened the drawing-room door, and stood
in it, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother, at Molly, at Mr. Preston, but not
advancing one step. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) colour, which had been brilliant the first
moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) entrance, faded away as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gazed; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes--her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
beautiful eyes--usually so soft and grave, seemed to fill with fire,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) brows to contract, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took the resolution to come forward
and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) place among the three, who were all looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with
different emotions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) moved calmly and slowly forwards; Mr. Preston
went a step or two to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) hand held out, and the whole
expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) face that of eager delight.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took no notice of the outstretched hand, nor of the chair
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sate down on a little sofa in one of the
windows, and called Molly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at my purchases,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This green ribbon was
fourteen-pence a yard, this silk three shillings,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went
on, forcing herself to speak about these trifles as if they were
all the world to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had no attention to throw away on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's visitor.

<p/>Mr. Preston took his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) cue from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), too, talked of the news of
the day, the local gossip--but Molly, who glanced up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) from
time to time, was almost alarmed by the bad expression of suppressed
anger, almost amounting to vindictiveness, which entirely marred his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
handsome looks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not wish to look again; and tried rather to
back up Cynthia's efforts at maintaining a separate conversation. Yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could not help overhearing Mrs. Gibson's strain after increased
civility, as if to make up for Cynthia's rudeness, and, if possible,
to deprecate his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) anger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) talked perpetually, as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) object
were to detain him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); whereas, previous to Cynthia's return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
allowed frequent pauses in the conversation, as though to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
the opportunity to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) leave.

<p/>In the course of the conversation between them the Hamleys came up.
Mrs. Gibson was never unwilling to dwell upon Molly's intimacy with
this county family; and when the latter caught the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
name, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother was saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mrs. Hamley could hardly do without Molly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) quite looked
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as a daughter, especially towards the last, when, I am
afraid, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had a good deal of anxiety. Mr. Osborne Hamley--I daresay
you have heard--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) did not do so well at college, and they had
expected so much--parents will, you know; but what did it signify?
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had not to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) living! I call it a very foolish kind of
ambition when a young man has not to go into a profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>stepmother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, at any rate, the Squire must be satisfied now. I saw this
morning's _Times_, with the Cambridge examination lists in it. Isn't
the second son called after his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, Roger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, starting up, and coming nearer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s senior wrangler, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Preston, almost as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) were vexed with himself for having anything to say that
could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pleasure. Molly went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) seat by Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mrs. Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), very softly, as if to herself. Cynthia
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand, in sympathy with Molly's sad and tender look, rather
than because she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) understood all that was passing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind, nor did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) quite understand it herself. A death that had come out of time;
a wonder whether the dead knew what passed upon the earth they had
left--the brilliant Osborne's failure, Roger's success; the vanity
of human wishes,--all these thoughts, and what they suggested, were
inextricably mingled up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) came to herself in a few
minutes. Mr. Preston was saying all the unpleasant things he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) could
think of about the Hamleys in a tone of false sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor old Squire--not the wisest of men--has woefully mismanaged
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) estate. And Osborne Hamley is too fine a gentleman to understand
the means by which to improve the value of the land--even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
the capital. A man who had practical knowledge of agriculture, and
some thousands of ready money, might bring the rental up to eight
thousand or so. Of course, Osborne will try and marry some one with
money; the family is old and well-established, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mustn't object
to commercial descent, though I daresay the Squire will for him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); but
then the young fellow himself is not the man for the work. No! the
family's going down fast; and it's a pity when these old Saxon houses
vanish off the land; but it is `kismet' with the Hamleys. Even the
senior wrangler--if it is that Roger Hamley--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) will have spent all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) brains in one effort. You never hear of a senior wrangler being
worth anything afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'ll be a Fellow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) college, of
course--that will be a livelihood for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe in senior wranglers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) clear high voice
ringing through the room. <div class="bookquote">``And from all I've ever heard of Mr. Roger
Hamley, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) will keep up the distinction he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has earned. And
I don't believe that the house of Hamley is so near extinction in
wealth and fame, and good name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are fortunate in having Miss Kirkpatrick's good word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Preston, rising to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about your
friends the Hamleys, except that they are your friends, and what you
have told me about them. But I won't have that man speaking of them
so--and your eyes filling with tears all the time. I'd sooner swear
to their having all the talents and good fortune under the sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>The only person of whom Cynthia appeared to be wholesomely afraid
was Mr. Gibson. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was present she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was more careful in speaking,
and showed more deference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) evident respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>),
and desire to win his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) good opinion, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) curb herself before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>);
and in this manner she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) earned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) favour as a lively, sensible girl,
with just so much knowledge of the world as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) a very desirable
companion to Molly. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made something of the same kind of
impression on all men. They were first struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) personal
appearance; and then with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty deprecating manner, which
appealed to them much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``You are wise, and I am
foolish--have mercy on my folly.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was a way she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had; it meant
nothing really; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was hardly conscious of it herself; but it
was very captivating all the same. Even old Williams, the gardener,
felt it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) confidante, Molly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, miss, but that be a rare young lady! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) do have such pretty
coaxing ways. I be to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to bud roses come the season--and
I'll warrant ye she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll learn sharp enough, for all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bees
so stupid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>If Molly had not had the sweetest disposition in the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might
have become jealous of all the allegiance laid at Cynthia's feet;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) never thought of comparing the amount of admiration and
love which they each received. Yet once she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did feel a little as
if Cynthia were poaching on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) manor. The invitation to the quiet
dinner had been sent to Osborne Hamley, and declined by him (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>)
thought it right to call soon afterwards. It was the first time Molly
had seen any of the family since she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) left the Hall, just before Mrs.
Hamley's death; and there was so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) wanted to ask. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
tried to wait patiently till Mrs. Gibson had exhausted the first gush
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) infinite nothings; and then Molly came in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) modest
questions. How was the Squire? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) old habits? Had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) health suffered?--putting each inquiry with as light and delicate
a touch as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been dressing a wound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hesitated a little,
a very little, before speaking of Roger; for just one moment the
thought flitted across her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind, that Osborne might feel the contrast
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother's college career too painfully to
like to have it referred to; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) remembered the generous
brotherly love that had always existed between the two, and had just
entered upon the subject, when Cynthia in obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother's
summons, came into the room, and took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) work. No one could have
been quieter--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hardly uttered a word; but Osborne seemed to fall
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) power at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) no longer gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) undivided attention
to Molly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) answers to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) questions; and by-and-by,
without Molly's rightly understanding how it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had turned
towards Cynthia, and was addressing himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Molly saw the
look of content on Mrs. Gibson's face; perhaps it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
mortification at not having heard all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wished to know about Roger,
which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a keener insight than usual, but certain it is that
all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) perceived that Mrs. Gibson would not dislike a
marriage between Osborne and Cynthia, and considered the present
occasion as an auspicious beginning. Remembering the secret which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
had been let into so unwillingly, Molly watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) behaviour, almost
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been retained in the interest of the absent wife; but,
after all, thinking as much of the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) attracting
Cynthia as of the unknown and mysterious Mrs. Osborne Hamley. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
manner was expressive of great interest and of strong prepossession
in favour of the beautiful girl to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was talking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was in
deep mourning, which showed off his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) slight figure and delicate
refined face. But there was nothing of flirting, as far as Molly
understood the meaning of the word, in either looks or words.
Cynthia, too, was extremely quiet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was always much quieter with
men than with women; it was part of the charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) soft allurement
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was so passive. They were talking of France. Mrs. Gibson
herself had passed two or three years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) girlhood there; and
Cynthia's late return from Boulogne made it a very natural subject
of conversation. But Molly was thrown out of it; and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart
still unsatisfied as to the details of Roger's success, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had to
stand up at last, and receive Osborne's good-by, scarcely longer or
more intimate than his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) farewell to Cynthia. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was gone,
Mrs. Gibson began in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, really, I begin to have some faith in long descent. What a
gentleman he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is! How agreeable and polite! So different from that
forward Mr. Preston,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) continued, looking a little anxiously at
Cynthia. Cynthia, quite aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) reply was being watched for,
said, coolly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Preston doesn't improve on acquaintance. There was a time,
mamma, when I think both you and I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) very agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember. You've a clearer memory than I have. But we were
talking of this delightful Mr. Osborne Hamley. Why, Molly, you were
always talking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) brother--it was Roger this, and Roger that--I
can't think how it was you so seldom mentioned this young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know I had mentioned Mr. Roger Hamley so often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said
Molly, blushing a little. <div class="bookquote">``But I saw much more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was more at
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well! It's all right, my dear. I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) suits you best.
But really, when I saw Osborne Hamley close to my Cynthia, I couldn't
help thinking--but perhaps I'd better not tell you what I was
thinking of. Only they are each of them so much above the average in
appearance; and, of course, that suggests things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I perfectly understand what you were thinking of, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said
Cynthia, with the greatest composure; <div class="bookquote">``and so does Molly, I have no
doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well! there's no harm in it, I'm sure. Did you hear him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) say that,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did not like to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) father alone just at present, yet
that when his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) brother Roger came back from Cambridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should feel
more at liberty! It was quite as much as to say, ``If you will ask me
to dinner then, I shall be delighted to come.<div class="bookquote">'' And chickens will be
so much cheaper, and cook has such a nice way of boning them, and
doing them up with forcemeat. Everything seems to be falling out
so fortunately. And Molly, my dear, you know I won't forget you.
By-and-by, when Roger Hamley has taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) turn at stopping at home
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father, we will ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to one of our little quiet dinners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was very slow at taking this in; but in about a minute the
sense of it had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) brain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went all over very red and
hot; especially as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw that Cynthia was watching the light come
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mind with great amusement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid Molly isn't properly grateful, mamma. If I were you, I
wouldn't exert myself to give a dinner-party on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) account. Bestow
all your kindness upon me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was often puzzled by Cynthia's speeches to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother; and this
was one of these occasions. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was more anxious to say something
for herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was so much annoyed at the implication in Mrs.
Gibson's last words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Roger Hamley has been very good to me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was a great deal at
home when I was there, and Mr. Osborne Hamley was very little there:
that was the reason I spoke so much more of one than the other. If I
had--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) coherence in the difficulty of finding
words,--<div class="bookquote">``I don't think I should,--oh, Cynthia, instead of laughing at
me, I think you might help me to explain myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead, Cynthia gave a diversion to the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma's paragon gives me an idea of weakness. I can't quite make out
whether it's in body or mind. Which is it, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is not strong, I know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s very accomplished and clever.
Every one says that,--even papa, who doesn't generally praise young
men. That made the puzzle the greater when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did so badly at
college.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) character that is weak. I'm sure there's weakness
somewhere; but he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s very agreeable. It must have been very pleasant,
staying at the Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but it's all over now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, wakening up from counting the
stitches in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) pattern. <div class="bookquote">``We shall have the young men coming to
dinner pretty often, you'll see. Your father likes them, and I shall
always make a point of welcoming his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends. They can't go on
mourning for a mother for ever. I expect we shall see a great deal of
them; and that the two families will become very intimate. After all,
these good Hollingford people are terribly behindhand, and I should
say, rather commonplace.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXI.

<p/>THE HALF-SISTERS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>It appeared as if Mrs. Gibson's predictions were likely to be
verified; for Osborne Hamley found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) drawing-room pretty
frequently. To be sure, sometimes prophets can help on the fulfilment
of their own prophecies; and Mrs. Gibson was not passive.

<p/>Molly was altogether puzzled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) manners and ways. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) spoke of
occasional absences from the Hall, without exactly saying where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
had been. But that was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) idea of the conduct of a married man;
who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) imagined, ought to have a house and servants, and pay rent
and taxes, and live with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. Who this mysterious wife might be
faded into insignificance before the wonder of where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was. London,
Cambridge, Dover, nay, even France, were mentioned by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as places
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been on these different little journeys. These facts
came out quite casually, almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unaware of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
betraying. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dropped out such sentences as these:--<div class="bookquote">``Ah,
that would be the day I was crossing! It was stormy indeed! Instead
of our being only two hours, we were nearly five.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Or, <div class="bookquote">``I met Lord
Hollingford at Dover last week, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) said,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>&c. <div class="bookquote">``The cold now is
nothing to what it was in London on Thursday--the thermometer was
down at 15 .''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Perhaps, in the rapid flow of conversation, these
small revelations were noticed by no one but Molly; whose interest
and curiosity were always hovering over the secret she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had become
possessed of, in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) self-reproach for allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
thoughts to dwell on what was still to be kept as a mystery.

<p/>It was also evident to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that Osborne was not too happy at home.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost the slight touch of cynicism which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had affected when
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was expected to do wonders at college; and that was one good
result of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) failure. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not give himself the trouble of
appreciating other people, and their performances, at any rate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
conversation was not so amply sprinkled with critical pepper. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
more absent, not so agreeable, Mrs. Gibson thought, but did not say.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked ill in health; but that might be the consequence of the
real depression of spirits which Molly occasionally saw peeping out
through all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasant surface-talk. Now and then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
talking directly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) referred to <div class="bookquote">``the happy days that are
gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or, <div class="bookquote">``to the time when my mother was alive;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice
sank, and a gloom came over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance, and Molly longed to
express her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own deep sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not often mention his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father;
and Molly thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could read in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, that
something of the painful restraint she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had noticed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was last
at the Hall still existed between them. Nearly every particular she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
knew of the family interior she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had heard from Mrs. Hamley, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was uncertain how far her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father was acquainted with them; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
did not like to question him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too closely; nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a man to be so
questioned as to the domestic affairs of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) patients. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
wondered if it was a dream--that short half-hour in the library at
Hamley Hall--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had learnt a fact which seemed so all-important
to Osborne, yet which made so little difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way of
life--either in speech or action. During the twelve or fourteen hours
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had remained at the Hall afterwards, no further allusion
had been made to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage, either by himself or by Roger. It was,
indeed, very like a dream. Probably Molly would have been rendered
much more uncomfortable in the possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) secret if Osborne
had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) as particularly attentive in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) devotion to Cynthia.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) evidently amused and attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), but not in any lively or
passionate kind of way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) beauty, and seemed to feel
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) charm; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) side, and come to sit near Molly,
if anything reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother, about which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could talk
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) alone. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came so often to the Gibsons, that
Mrs. Gibson might be excused for the fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had taken into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
head, that it was for Cynthia's sake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) liked the lounge, the
friendliness, the company of two intelligent girls of beauty and
manners above the average; one of whom stood in a peculiar relation
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), as having been especially beloved by the mother whose memory
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cherished so fondly. Knowing himself to be out of the category
of bachelors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was, perhaps, too indifferent as to other people's
ignorance, and its possible consequences.

<p/>Somehow, Molly did not like to be the first to introduce Roger's name
into the conversation, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lost many an opportunity of hearing
intelligence about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). Osborne was often so languid or so absent
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) only followed the lead of talk; and as an awkward fellow,
who had paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) no particular attention, and as a second son, Roger
was not pre-eminent in Mrs. Gibson's thoughts; Cynthia had never
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and the freak did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) often to speak about him (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) had not come home since he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) had obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) high place in the
mathematical lists: that Molly knew; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) was
working hard for something--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) supposed a fellowship--and that was
all. Osborne's tone in speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) was always the same: every
word, every inflection of the voice breathed out affection and
respect--nay, even admiration! And this from the _nil admirari_
brother, who seldom carried his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) exertions so far.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Roger!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said one day. Molly caught the name in an instant,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had not heard what had gone before. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is a fellow in a
thousand--in a thousand, indeed! I don't believe there is his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) match
anywhere for goodness and real solid power combined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, after Mr. Osborne Hamley had gone, <div class="bookquote">``what sort
of a man is this Roger Hamley? One can't tell how much to believe of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) brother's praises; for it is the one subject on which Osborne
Hamley becomes enthusiastic. I've noticed it once or twice before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Osborne Hamley/Mr. Osborne/Osborne</b></font>)</div><p/>While Molly hesitated on which point of the large round to begin her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
description, Mrs. Gibson struck in,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It just shows what a sweet disposition Osborne Hamley is of--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) should praise his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) brother as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) does. I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is a senior
wrangler, and much good may it do him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)! I don't deny that; but as for
conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s as heavy as heavy can be. A great awkward fellow
to boot, who looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not know two and two made four, for
all he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is such a mathematical genius. You would hardly believe he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
was Osborne Hamley's brother to see him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)! I should not think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has a
profile at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said the persevering Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has been very kind to me. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
isn't handsome like Osborne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>It was rather difficult to say all this quietly, but Molly managed to
do it, quite aware that Cynthia would not rest till she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had extracted
some kind of an opinion out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will come home at Easter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, <div class="bookquote">``and then I
shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a great pity that their being in mourning will prevent their
going to the Easter charity ball,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, plaintively.
<div class="bookquote">``I shan't like to take you two girls, if you are not to have any
partners. It will put me in such an awkward position. I wish we could
join on to the Towers party. That would secure you partners, for they
always bring a number of dancing men, who might dance with you after
they had done their duty by the ladies of the house. But really
everything is so changed since dear Lady Cumnor has been an invalid
that, perhaps, they won't go at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>This Easter ball was a great subject of conversation with Mrs.
Gibson. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sometimes spoke of it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) first appearance in society
as a bride, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been visiting once or twice a week all
winter long. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) shifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ground, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt so much
interest in it, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would then have the responsibility of
introducing both her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own and Mr. Gibson's daughter to public notice,
though the fact was that pretty nearly every one who was going to
this ball had seen the two young ladies--though not their ball
dresses--before. But, aping the manners of the aristocracy as far
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) intended to <div class="bookquote">``bring out''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Molly and Cynthia on
this occasion, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) regarded in something of the light of a
presentation at Court. <div class="bookquote">``They are not out yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) favourite
excuse when either of them was invited to any house to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did
not wish them to go, or they were invited without her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) even made
a difficulty about their <div class="bookquote">``not being out''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>when Miss Browning--that
old friend of the Gibson family--came in one morning to ask the two
girls to come to a friendly tea and a round game afterwards; this
mild piece of gaiety being designed as an attention to three of Mrs.
Goodenough's grandchildren--two young ladies and their schoolboy
brother--who were staying on a visit to their grand-mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, Miss Browning, but, you see, I hardly like to let
them go--they are not out, you know, till after the Easter ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till when we are invisible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, always ready with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
mockery to exaggerate any pretension of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother's. <div class="bookquote">``We are so high
in rank that our sovereign must give us her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) sanction before we can
play a round game at your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia enjoyed the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own full-grown size and stately gait,
as contrasted with that of a meek, half-fledged girl in the nursery;
but Miss Browning was half puzzled and half affronted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand it at all. In my days girls went wherever it
pleased people to ask them, without this farce of bursting out in all
their new fine clothes at some public place. I don't mean but what
the gentry took their daughters to York, or Matlock, or Bath, to
give them a taste of gay society when they were growing up; and the
quality went up to London, and their young ladies were presented to
Queen Charlotte, and went to a birthday ball, perhaps. But for us
little Hollingford people--why, we knew every child amongst us from
the day of its birth; and many a girl of twelve or fourteen have I
seen go out to a card-party, and sit quiet at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) work, and know how
to behave as well as any lady there. There was no talk of `coming
out' in those days for any one under the daughter of a Squire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After Easter, Molly and I shall know how to behave at a card-party,
but not before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, demurely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're always fond of your quips and your cranks, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Browning, <div class="bookquote">``and I wouldn't quite answer for your behaviour: you
sometimes let your spirits carry you away. But I'm quite sure Molly
will be a little lady as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) always is, and always was, and I have
known her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) from a babe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson took up arms on behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own daughter, or, rather,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took up arms against Molly's praises.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you would have called Molly a lady the other day,
Miss Browning, if you had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) where I did: sitting up in a
cherry-tree, six feet from the ground at least, I do assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but that wasn't pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) head at
Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd left off those tom-boy ways.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) wants the refinement which good society gives in several ways,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, returning to the attack on poor Molly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)'s very
apt to come upstairs two steps at a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only two, Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``Why, to-day I found I could manage
four of these broad shallow steps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, what are you saying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only confessing that I, like Molly, want the refinements which good
society gives; therefore, please do let us go to Miss Brownings'
this evening. I will pledge myself for Molly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shan't sit in
a cherry-tree; and Molly shall see that I don't go upstairs in an
unladylike way. I will go upstairs as meekly as if I were a come-out
young lady, and had been to the Easter ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So it was agreed that they should go. If Mr. Osborne Hamley had been
named as one of the probable visitors, there would have been none of
this difficulty about the affair.

<p/>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was not there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) brother Roger was. Molly saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in
a minute when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) entered the little drawing-room; but Cynthia did
not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And see, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe Browning, turning them round
to the side where Roger stood waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) turn of speaking
to Molly, <div class="bookquote">``we've got a gentleman for you after all! Wasn't it
fortunate?--just as sister said that you might find it dull--you,
Cynthia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) meant, because you know you come from France--then, just
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been sent from heaven, Mr. Roger came in to call; and I
won't say we laid violent hands on him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was too good for
that; but really we should have been near it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not stayed of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own accord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>The moment Roger had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cordial greeting to Molly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to Cynthia.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: ROGER IS INTRODUCED AND ENSLAVED.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)--your new sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>ROGER</b></font>) added, with the kind smile
Molly remembered so well since the very first day she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had seen it
directed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sate crying under the weeping ash.
Cynthia was standing a little behind Molly when Roger asked for this
introduction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was generally dressed with careless grace. Molly,
who was delicate neatness itself, used sometimes to wonder how
Cynthia's tumbled gowns, tossed away so untidily, had the art of
looking so well, and falling in such graceful folds. For instance,
the pale lilac muslin gown she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) wore this evening had been worn many
times before, and had looked unfit to wear again till Cynthia put
it on. Then the limpness became softness, and the very creases took
the lines of beauty. Molly, in a daintily clean pink muslin, did not
look half so elegantly dressed as Cynthia. The grave eyes that the
latter raised when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had to be presented to Roger had a sort of
child-like innocence and wonder about them, which did not quite
belong to Cynthia's character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) armour of magic that
evening--involuntarily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) always did; but, on the other side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
could not help trying her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) power on strangers. Molly had always felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should have a right to a good long talk with Roger when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
next saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), or she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should gather from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) all the details she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) so longed to hear about the Squire--about
the Hall--about Osborne--about himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was just as cordial and
friendly as ever with her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>). If Cynthia had not been there, all would
have gone on as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had anticipated; but of all the victims to
Cynthia's charms he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) fell most prone and abject. Molly saw it all,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sitting next to Miss Phoebe at the tea-table, acting
right-hand, and passing cake, cream, sugar, with such busy assiduity
that every one besides herself thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
hands, was fully occupied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tried to talk to the two shy girls,
as in virtue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) two years' seniority she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought herself bound
to do; and the consequence was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went upstairs with the twain
clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms, and willing to swear an eternal friendship.
Nothing would satisfy them but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must sit between them at
vingt-un; and they were so desirous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) advice in the important
point of fixing the price of the counters that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not ever
have joined in the animated conversation going on between Roger and
Cynthia. Or, rather, it would be more correct to say that Roger was
talking in a most animated manner to Cynthia, whose sweet eyes were
fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face with a look of great interest in all he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was
saying, while it was only now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) low replies.
Molly caught a few words occasionally in intervals of business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At my uncle's, we always give a silver threepence for three dozen.
You know what a silver threepence is, don't you, dear Miss Gibson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The three classes are published in the Senate House at nine o'clock
on the Friday morning, and you can't imagine--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it will be thought rather shabby to play at anything less
than sixpence. That gentleman''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this in a whisper-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``is at Cambridge,
and you know they always play very high there, and sometimes ruin
themselves, don't they, dear Miss Gibson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, on this occasion the Master of Arts who precedes the candidates
for honours when they go into the Senate House is called the Father
of the College to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) belongs. I think I mentioned that before,
didn't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>So Cynthia was hearing all about Cambridge, and the very examination
about which Molly had felt such keen interest, without having ever
been able to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) questions answered by a competent person;
and Roger, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had always looked as the final and most
satisfactory answerer, was telling the whole of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wanted to
know, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not listen. It took all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) patience to make up
little packets of counters, and settle, as the arbiter of the game,
whether it would be better for the round or the oblong counters to be
reckoned as six. And when all was done, and every one sate in their
places round the table, Roger and Cynthia had to be called twice
before they came. They stood up, it is true, at the first sound of
their names; but they did not move--Roger went on talking, Cynthia
listening till the second call; when they hurried to the table and
tried to appear, all on a sudden, quite interested in the great
questions of the game--namely, the price of three dozen counters, and
whether, all things considered, it would be better to call the round
counters or the oblong half-a-dozen each. Miss Browning, drumming the
pack of cards on the table, and quite ready to begin dealing, decided
the matter by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Rounds are sixes, and three dozen counters
cost sixpence. Pay up, if you please, and let us begin at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>Cynthia sate between Roger and William Orford, the young schoolboy,
who bitterly resented on this occasion his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sisters' habit of calling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Willie,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thought it was this boyish sobriquet which
prevented Cynthia from attending as much to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as to Mr. Roger
Hamley; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) also was charmed by the charmer, who found leisure to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) one or two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sweet smiles. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) return home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
grand-mamma's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) gave out one or two very decided and rather original
opinions, quite opposed--as was natural--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sisters'. One was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That, after all, a senior wrangler was no great shakes. Any man
might be one if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked, but there were a lot of fellows that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knew who would be very sorry to go in for anything so slow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly thought the game never would end. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had no particular turn
for gambling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) card might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) regularly
put on two counters, indifferent as to whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) won or lost.
Cynthia, on the contrary, staked high, and was at one time very rich,
but ended by being in debt to Molly something like six shillings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) purse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, and was obliged to borrow from the
more provident Molly, who was aware that the round game of which Miss
Browning had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) was likely to require money. If it was
not a very merry affair for all the individuals concerned, it was
a very noisy one on the whole. Molly thought it was going to last
till midnight; but punctually, as the clock struck nine, the little
maid-servant staggered in under the weight of a tray loaded with
sandwiches, cakes, and jelly. This brought on a general move; and
Roger, who appeared to have been on the watch for something of the
kind, came and took a chair by Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to see you again--it seems such a long time since
Christmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice, and not alluding more
exactly to the day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had left the Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``we are close to Easter now. I
have so wanted to tell you how glad I was to hear about your honours
at Cambridge. I once thought of sending you a message through
your brother, but then I thought it might be making too much fuss,
because I know nothing of mathematics, or of the value of a senior
wranglership; and you were sure to have so many congratulations from
people who did know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I missed yours though, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), kindly. <div class="bookquote">``But I felt sure you
were glad for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad and proud too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I should so like to hear something
more about it. I heard you telling Cynthia--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. What a charming person she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is! I should think you must be
happier than we expected long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But tell me something about the senior wranglership, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said
Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a long story, and I ought to be helping the Miss Brownings to
hand sandwiches--besides, you wouldn't find it very interesting, it's
so full of technical details.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia looked very much interested,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! then I refer you to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), for I must go now. I can't for shame
go on sitting here, and letting those good ladies have all the
trouble. But I shall come and call on Mrs. Gibson soon. Are you
walking home to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>replied Molly, eagerly foreseeing what was to
come.

<p/>``Then I shall walk home with you. I left my horse at the ``George,<div class="bookquote">''
and that's half-way. I suppose old Betty will allow me to accompany
you and your sister? You used to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) as something of a
dragon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George du Maurier</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Betty has left us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, sadly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)'s gone to live at a
place at Ashcombe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) made a face of dismay, and then went off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) duties. The short
conversation had been very pleasant, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) manner had had just the
brotherly kindness of old times; but it was not quite the manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
had to Cynthia; and Molly half thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have preferred the
latter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was now hovering about Cynthia, who had declined the offer
of refreshments from Willie Orford. Roger was tempting her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), and with
playful entreaties urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to take some thing from him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). Every word
they said could be heard by the whole room; yet every word was said,
on Roger's part at least, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not have spoken it in that
peculiar manner to any one else. At length, and rather more because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was weary of being entreated, than because it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wish,
Cynthia took a macaroon, and Roger seemed as happy as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
had crowned him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) with flowers. The whole affair was as trifling and
commonplace as could be in itself; hardly worth noticing; and yet
Molly did notice it, and felt uneasy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not tell why. As it
turned out, it was a rainy night, and Mrs. Gibson sent a fly for the
two girls instead of old Betty's substitute. Both Cynthia and Molly
thought of the possibility of their taking the two Orford girls back
to their grandmother's, and so saving them a wet walk; but Cynthia
got the start in speaking about it; and the thanks and the implied
praise for thoughtfulness were hers.

<p/>When they got home Mr. and Mrs. Gibson were sitting in the
drawing-room, quite ready to be amused by any details of the evening.

<p/>Cynthia began,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! it wasn't very entertaining. One didn't expect that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
yawned wearily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who were there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``Quite a young party--wasn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'd only asked Lizzie and Fanny Orford, and their brother; but
Mr. Roger Hamley had ridden over and called on Miss Brownings, and
they kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to tea. No one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger Hamley there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s come home then. I must
make time to ride over and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd much better ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose you
invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) brother to dine here on Friday, my dear. It would
be a very pretty attention, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear! these young Cambridge men have a very good taste in wine,
and don't spare it. My cellar won't stand many of their attacks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't think you were so inhospitable, Mr. Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not inhospitable, I'm sure. If you'll put `bitter beer' in the
corner of your notes of invitation, just as the smart people put
`quadrilles' as a sign of the entertainment offered, we'll have
Osborne and Roger to dinner any day you like. And what did you think
of my favourite, Cynthia? You hadn't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) before, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s nothing like so handsome as his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother; nor so polished;
nor so easy to talk to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) entertained me for more than an hour with
a long account of some examination or other; but there's something
one likes about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--and Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, who piqued herself on being an
impartial stepmother, and who always tried hard to make Molly talk as
much as Cynthia,--<div class="bookquote">``what sort of an evening have you had?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very pleasant, thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) heart a little belied her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said
this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had not cared for the round game; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would have cared
for Roger's conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had had what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was indifferent to,
and not had what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would have liked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've had our unexpected visitor, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``Just after
dinner, who should come in but Mr. Preston. I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s having
more of the management of the Hollingford property than formerly.
Sheepshanks is getting an old man. And if so, I suspect we shall
see a good deal of Preston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s `no blate,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as they used to say in
Scotland, and made himself quite at home to-night. If I'd asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
to stay, or, indeed, if I'd done anything but yawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'d have been
here now. But I defy any man to stay when I've a fit of yawning.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like Mr. Preston, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About as much as I do half the men I meet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) talks well, and has
seen a good deal. I know very little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), though, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s
my lord's steward, which is a guarantee for a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Harriet spoke pretty strongly against him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) that day I was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at the Manor-house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Harriet's always full of fancies: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) likes persons to-day, and
dislikes them to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, who was touched on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
sore point whenever Molly quoted Lady Harriet, or said anything to
imply ever so transitory an intimacy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must know a good deal about Mr. Preston, my dear. I suppose you
saw a good deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) at Ashcombe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson coloured, and looked at Cynthia before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) replied.
Cynthia's face was set into a determination not to speak, however
much she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) might be referred to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; we saw a good deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)--at one time, I mean. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s
changeable, I think. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) always sent us game, and sometimes fruit.
There were some stories against him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), but I never believed them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What kind of stories?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, vague stories, you know: scandal, I daresay. No one ever
believed them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) could be so agreeable if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) chose; and my lord, who
is so very particular, would never have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) as agent if they
were true; not that I ever knew what they were, for I consider all
scandal as abominable gossip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad I yawned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) face,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'ll
take the hint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it was one of your giant-gapes, papa, I should call it more than
a hint,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``And if you want a yawning chorus the next time
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) comes, I'll join in; won't you, Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>replied the latter, shortly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
bed-candle. The two girls had usually some nightly conversation in
one or other of their bed-rooms; but to-night Cynthia said something
or other about being terribly tired, and hastily shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) door.

<p/>The very next day, Roger came to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) promised call. Molly was out
in the garden with Williams, planning the arrangement of some new
flower-beds, and deep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) employment of placing pegs upon the lawn
to mark out the different situations, when, standing up to mark the
effect, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eye was caught by the figure of a gentleman, sitting with
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back to the light, leaning forwards and talking, or listening,
eagerly. Molly knew the shape of the head perfectly, and hastily
began to put off her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) brown-holland gardening apron, emptying the
pockets as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke to Williams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can finish it now, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You know about the
bright-coloured flowers being against the privet-hedge, and where the
new rose-bed is to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't justly say as I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mebbe, you'll just go o'er it
all once again, Miss Molly. I'm not so young as I oncst was, and my
head is not so clear now-a-days, and I'd be loath to make mistakes
when you're so set upon your plans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) impulse in a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw that the old gardener
was really perplexed, yet that he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) was as anxious as he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) could be to do
his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) best. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went over the ground again, pegging and explaining
till the wrinkled brow was smooth again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) kept saying, <div class="bookquote">``I see,
miss. All right, Miss Molly, I`se gotten it in my head as clear as
patchwork now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>), and go in. But just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was close to the
garden door, Roger came out. It really was for once a case of virtue
its own reward, for it was far pleasanter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in a
tête-à-tête, however short, than in the restraint of Mrs. Gibson's
and Cynthia's presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only just found out where you were, Molly. Mrs. Gibson said you
had gone out, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) didn't know where; and it was the greatest
chance that I turned round and saw you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you some time ago, but I couldn't leave Williams. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>)
was unusually slow to-day; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) couldn't understand
my plans for the new flower-beds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the paper you've got in your hand? Let me look at it, will
you? Ah, I see! you've borrowed some of your ideas from our garden at
home, haven't you? This bed of scarlet geraniums, with the border of
young oaks, pegged down! That was a fancy of my dear mother's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both silent for a minute or two. Then Molly said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is the Squire? I've never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) told me how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wanted to see you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) couldn't make
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind to come and call. I suppose it would never do now for you
to come and stay at the Hall, would it? It would give my father so
much pleasure: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks upon you as a daughter, and I'm sure both
Osborne and I shall always consider you are like a sister to us,
after all my mother's love for you, and your tender care of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at
last. But I suppose it wouldn't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy if you could come it would put us a little to rights. You
know, as I think I once told you, Osborne has behaved differently to
what I should have done, though not wrongly,--only what I call an
error of judgment. But my father, I'm sure, has taken up some notion
of--never mind; only the end of it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) holds Osborne still in
tacit disgrace, and is miserable himself all the time. Osborne, too,
is sore and unhappy, and estranged from my father. It is just what
my mother would have put right very soon, and perhaps you could
have done it--unconsciously, I mean--for this wretched mystery that
Osborne preserves about his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) affairs is at the root of it all. But
there's no use talking about it; I don't know why I began.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Then,
with a wrench, changing the subject, while Molly still thought of
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) broke out,--<div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you how
much I like Miss Kirkpatrick, Molly. It must be a great pleasure to
you having such a companion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, half smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and I think I
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) better every day I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). But how quickly you have found
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) virtues!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I didn't say ``virtues,<div class="bookquote">'' did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), reddening, but putting
the question in all good faith. <div class="bookquote">``Yet I don't think one could be
deceived in that face. And Mrs. Gibson appears to be a very friendly
person,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) has asked Osborne and me to dine here on Friday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bitter beer''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>came into Molly's mind; but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said was, <div class="bookquote">``And are
you coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, I am, unless my father wants me; and I've given Mrs.
Gibson a conditional promise for Osborne, too. So I shall see you all
very soon again. But I must go now. I have to keep an appointment
seven miles from here in half-an-hour's time. Good luck to your
flower-garden, Molly.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXII.

<p/>THE OLD SQUIRE``S TROUBLES.


<p/>Affairs were going on worse at the Hall than Roger had liked to tell.
Moreover, very much of the discomfort there arose from <div class="bookquote">``mere manner,''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>as people express it, which is always indescribable and indefinable.
Quiet and passive as Mrs. Hamley had always been in appearance,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was the ruling spirit of the house as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) lived. The
directions to the servants, down to the most minute particulars,
came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) sitting-room, or from the sofa on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) lay. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
children always knew where to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>); and to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), was to find
love and sympathy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) husband, who was often restless and angry from
one cause or another, always came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to be smoothed down and
put right. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) pleasant influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and
became at peace with himself when in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) presence; just as a child
is at ease when with some one who is both firm and gentle. But the
keystone of the family arch was gone, and the stones of which it
was composed began to fall apart. It is always sad when a sorrow of
this kind seems to injure the character of the mourning survivors.
Yet, perhaps, this injury may be only temporary or superficial; the
judgments so constantly passed upon the way in which people bear the
loss of those whom they have deeply loved, appear to be even more
cruel, and wrongly meted out, than human judgments generally are. To
careless observers, for instance, it would seem as though the Squire
was rendered more capricious and exacting, more passionate and
authoritative, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife's death. The truth was, that it occurred
at a time when many things came to harass him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and some to bitterly
disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); and _she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)_ was no longer there to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) used to
carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sore heart for the gentle balm of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sweet words. So the
sore heart ached and smarted intensely; and often, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) saw how
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) violent conduct affected others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could have cried out for
their pity, instead of their anger and resentment: <div class="bookquote">``Have mercy upon
me, for I am very miserable.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>How often have such dumb thoughts gone
up from the hearts of those who have taken hold of their sorrow
by the wrong end, as prayers against sin! And when the Squire saw
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) servants were learning to dread him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) first-born to
avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not blame them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was becoming a domestic
tyrant; it seemed as if all circumstances conspired against him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was too weak to struggle with them; else, why did everything
in doors and out of doors go so wrong just now, when all he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could
have done, had things been prosperous, was to have submitted, in very
imperfect patience, to the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife? But just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) needed
ready money to pacify Osborne's creditors, the harvest had turned out
remarkably plentiful, and the price of corn had sunk down to a level
it had not touched for years. The Squire had insured his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) life at the
time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) marriage for a pretty large sum. It was to be a provision
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) survived him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and for their younger children.
Roger was the only representative of these interests now; but the
Squire was unwilling to lose the insurance by ceasing to pay the
annual sum. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would not, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could, have sold any part of the
estate which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father; and, besides, it was
strictly entailed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had sometimes thought how wise a step it
would have been could he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) have sold a portion of it, and with the
purchase-money have drained and reclaimed the remainder; and at
length, learning from some neighbour that Government would make
certain advances for drainage, &c., at a very low rate of interest,
on condition that the work was done, and the money repaid, within a
given time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife had urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) to take advantage of the proffered
loan. But now that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was no longer there to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and take
an interest in the progress of the work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grew indifferent to it
himself, and cared no more to go out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) stout roan cob, and sit
square on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) seat, watching the labourers on the marshy land all
overgrown with rushes; speaking to them from time to time in their
own strong nervous country dialect: but the interest to Government
had to be paid all the same, whether the men worked well or ill.
Then the roof of the Hall let in the melted snow-water this winter;
and, on examination, it turned out that a new roof was absolutely
required. The men who had come about the advances made to Osborne by
the London money-lender, had spoken disparagingly of the timber on
the estate--<div class="bookquote">``Very fine trees--sound, perhaps, too, fifty years ago,
but gone to rot now; had wanted lopping and clearing. Was there no
wood-ranger or forester? They were nothing like the value young Mr.
Hamley had represented them to be.''  (<font color='red'><b>the London money-lender</b></font>)</div>The remarks had come round to
the squire's ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) loved the trees he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had played under as a boy
as if they were living creatures; that was on the romantic side of
his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) nature. Merely looking at them as representing so many pounds
sterling, he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had esteemed them highly, and had had, until now,
no opinion of another by which to correct his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own judgment. So
these words of the valuers cut him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) sharp, although he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) affected to
disbelieve them, and tried to persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) did so. But,
after all, these cares and disappointments did not touch the root of
his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) deep resentment against Osborne. There is nothing like wounded
affection for giving poignancy to anger. And the Squire believed that
Osborne and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) advisers had been making calculations, based upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
own death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hated the idea so much--it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) so miserable--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would not face it, and define it, and meet it with full inquiry
and investigation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) chose rather to cherish the morbid fancy that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was useless in this world--born under an unlucky star--that all
things went badly under his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) management. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not become humble
in consequence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) misfortunes down to the score of Fate--not
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) imagined that Osborne saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) failures, and that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) first-born grudged him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) natural term of life. All these
fancies would have been set to rights could he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) have talked them over
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife; or even had he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) been accustomed to mingle much in
the society of those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) esteemed his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) equals; but, as has been
stated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was inferior in education to those who should have been
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mates; and perhaps the jealousy and _mauvaise honte_ that this
inferiority had called out long ago, extended itself in some measure
to the feelings he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) entertained towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sons--less to Roger
than to Osborne, though the former was turning out by far the most
distinguished man. But Roger was practical; interested in all
out-of-doors things, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) enjoyed the details, homely enough, which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father sometimes gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) of the every-day occurrences which
the latter had noticed in the woods and the fields. Osborne, on the
contrary, was what is commonly called <div class="bookquote">``fine;''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>delicate almost to
effeminacy in dress and in manner; careful in small observances. All
this his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father had been rather proud of in the days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) looked
forward to a brilliant career at Cambridge for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) son; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had at
that time regarded Osborne's fastidiousness and elegance as another
stepping-stone to the high and prosperous marriage which was to
restore the ancient fortunes of the Hamley family. But now that
Osborne had barely obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) degree; that all the boastings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
father had proved vain; that the fastidiousness had led to unexpected
expenses -LRB-to attribute the most innocent cause to Osborne's debts-RRB-,
the poor young man's ways and manners became a subject of irritation
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father. Osborne was still occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) books and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
writings when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at home; and this mode of passing the greater
part of the day gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but few subjects in common with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father
when they did meet at meal times, or in the evenings. Perhaps if
Osborne had been able to have more out-of-door amusements it would
have been better; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was short-sighted, and cared little for the
carefully observant pursuits of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew but few young
men of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own standing in the county; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hunting even, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was passionately fond, had been curtailed this season, as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father
had disposed of one of the two hunters he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been hitherto allowed.
The whole stable establishment had been reduced; perhaps because it
was the economy which told most on the enjoyment of both the Squire
and Osborne, and which, therefore, the former took a savage pleasure
in enforcing. The old carriage--a heavy family coach bought in the
days of comparative prosperity--was no longer needed after madam's
death, and fell to pieces in the cobwebbed seclusion of the
coach-house. The best of the two carriage-horses was taken for a gig,
which the Squire now set up; saying many a time to all who might
care to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) that it was the first time for generations
that the Hamleys of Hamley had not been able to keep their own coach.
The other carriage-horse was turned out to grass; being too old for
regular work. Conqueror used to come whinnying up to the park palings
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Conqueror</b></font>) saw the Squire, who had always a piece of bread, or some
sugar, or an apple for the old favourite; and would make many a
complaining speech to the dumb animal, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Conqueror</b></font>) of the change of
times since both were in their prime. It had never been the Squire's
custom to encourage his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) boys to invite their friends to the Hall.
Perhaps this, too, was owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) _mauvaise honte_, and also to an
exaggerated consciousness of the deficiencies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) establishment as
compared with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) imagined these lads were accustomed to at home.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) explained this once or twice to Osborne and Roger when they were
at Rugby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, all you public schoolboys have a kind of freemasonry of
your own, and outsiders are looked on by you much as I look on
rabbits and all that isn't game. Ay, you may laugh, but it is so; and
your friends will throw their eyes askance at me, and never think on
my pedigree, which would beat theirs all to shivers, I'll be bound.
No; I'll have no one here at the Hall who will look down on a Hamley
of Hamley, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) only knows how to make a cross instead of write
his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sons</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, of course, they must not visit at houses to whose sons the
Squire could not or would not return a like hospitality. On all these
points Mrs. Hamley had used her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) utmost influence without avail;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) prejudices were immoveable. As regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) position as head
of the oldest family in three counties, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) pride was invincible;
as regarded himself personally--ill at ease in the society of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) equals, deficient in manners, and in education--his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) morbid
sensitiveness was too sore and too self-conscious to be called
humility.

<p/>Take one instance from among many similar scenes of the state of
feeling between him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eldest son, which, if it could not be
called active discord, showed at least passive estrangement.

<p/>It took place on an evening in the March succeeding Mrs. Hamley's
death. Roger was at Cambridge. Osborne had also been from home, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not volunteered any information as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) absence. The Squire
believed that Osborne had been either at Cambridge with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) brother,
or in London; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would have liked to hear where his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son had been,
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been doing, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had seen, purely as pieces of
news, and as some diversion from the domestic worries and cares which
were pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hard; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was too proud to ask any questions,
and Osborne had not given him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) any details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) journey. This
silence had aggravated the Squire's internal dissatisfaction, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) came home to dinner weary and sore-hearted a day or two after
Osborne's return. It was just six o'clock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) went hastily into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own little business-room on the ground-floor, and, after washing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands, came into the drawing-room feeling as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) were very
late, but the room was empty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) glanced at the clock over the
mantel-piece, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tried to warm his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands at the fire. The fire had
been neglected, and had gone out during the day; it was now piled up
with half-dried wood, which sputtered and smoked instead of doing its
duty in blazing and warming the room, through which the keen wind was
cutting its way in all directions. The clock had stopped, no one had
remembered to wind it up, but by the squire's watch it was already
past dinner-time. The old butler put his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) head into the room, but,
seeing the squire alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) was about to draw it back, and wait
for Mr. Osborne, before announcing dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had hoped to do this
unperceived, but the squire caught him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) in the act.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why isn't dinner ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) called out sharply. <div class="bookquote">``It's ten minutes
past six. And, pray, why are you using this wood? It's impossible to
get oneself warm by such a fire as this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe, sir, that Thomas--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk to me of Thomas. Send dinner in directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>About five minutes elapsed, spent by the hungry Squire in all sorts
of impatient ways--attacking Thomas, who came in to look after
the fire; knocking the logs about, scattering out sparks, but
considerably lessening the chances of warmth; touching up the
candles, which appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to give a light unusually insufficient
for the large cold room. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was doing this, Osborne came in
dressed in full evening dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) always moved slowly; and this, to
begin with, irritated the Squire. Then an uncomfortable consciousness
of a black coat, drab trousers, checked cotton cravat, and splashed
boots, forced itself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) saw Osborne's point-device
costume. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) chose to consider it affectation and finery in Osborne,
and was on the point of bursting out with some remark, when the
butler, who had watched Osborne downstairs before making the
announcement, came in to say dinner was ready.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It surely isn't six o'clock?''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) dainty
little watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) was scarcely more unaware than it of the storm that
was brewing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Six o'clock! It's more than a quarter past,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>growled out his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy your watch must be wrong, sir. I set mine by the Horse
Guards only two days ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, impugning that old steady, turnip-shaped watch of the Squire's
was one of the insults which, as it could not reasonably be resented,
was not to be forgiven. That watch had been given him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
father when watches were watches long ago. It had given the law to
house-clocks, stable-clocks, kitchen-clocks--nay, even to Hamley
Church clock in its day; and was it now, in its respectable old age,
to be looked down upon by a little whipper-snapper of a French watch
which could go into a man's waistcoat pocket, instead of having to
be extricated, with due effort, like a respectable watch of size and
position, from a fob in the waistband? No! not if the whipper-snapper
were backed by all the Horse Guards that ever were, with the Life
Guards to boot. Poor Osborne might have known better than to cast
this slur on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's flesh and blood; for so dear did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hold
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My watch is like myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire girning</b></font>)</div>said the squire, <div class="bookquote">``girning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire girning</b></font>)</div>as the Scotch
say--<div class="bookquote">``plain, but steady-going. At any rate, it gives the law in my
house. The King may go by the Horse Guards if he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Scotch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, really anxious to keep the
peace, <div class="bookquote">``I went by my watch, which is certainly right by London time;
and I'd no idea you were waiting for me; otherwise I could have
dressed much quicker.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, looking sarcastically at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
son's attire. <div class="bookquote">``When I was a young man I should have been ashamed to
have spent as much time at my looking-glass as if I'd been a girl.
I could make myself as smart as any one when I was going to a dance,
or to a party where I was likely to meet pretty girls; but I should
have laughed myself to scorn if I'd stood fiddle-faddling at a glass,
smirking at my own likeness, all for my own pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne reddened, and was on the point of letting fly some caustic
remark on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father's dress at the present moment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) contented
himself with saying, in a low voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother always expected us all to dress for dinner. I got into the
habit of doing it to please her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and I keep it up now.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
had a certain kind of feeling of loyalty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) memory in keeping
up all the little domestic habits and customs she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had instituted or
preferred. But the contrast which the Squire thought was implied by
Osborne's remark, put him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) beside himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I, too, try to attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wishes. I do; and in more important
things. I did when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was alive; and I do so now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said you did not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, astonished at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father's
passionate words and manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did, sir. You meant it. I could see by your looks. I saw
you look at my morning coat. At any rate, I never neglected any wish
of hers in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lifetime. If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d wished me to go to school again
and learn my A, B, C, I would. By -- I would; and I wouldn't have
gone playing me, and lounging away my time, for fear of vexing and
disappointing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Yet some folks older than school-boys--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The squire choked here; but though the words would not come his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
passion did not diminish. <div class="bookquote">``I'll not have you casting up your mother's
wishes to me, sir. You, who went near to break her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart at last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne was strongly tempted to get up and leave the room. Perhaps it
would have been better if he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had; it might then have brought about
an explanation, and a reconciliation between father and son. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did well in sitting still and appearing to take no notice.
This indifference to what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was saying appeared to annoy the Squire
still more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) kept on grumbling and talking to himself till
Osborne, unable to bear it any longer, said, very quietly, but very
bitterly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am only a cause of irritation to you, and home is no longer home
to me, but a place in which I am to be controlled in trifles, and
scolded about trifles as if I were a child. Put me in a way of making
a living for myself--that much your oldest son has a right to ask of
you--I will then leave this house, and you shall be no longer vexed
by my dress, or my want of punctuality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>``You make your request pretty much as another son did long ago: ``Give
me the portion that falleth to me.<div class="bookquote">'' But I don't think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) money is much encouragement for me to--.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Then the thought
of how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could give his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``portion,''  (<font color='red'><b>son portion</b></font>)</div>or any part of it,
stopped the Squire.

<p/>Osborne took up the speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm as ready as any man to earn my living; only the preparation for
any profession will cost money, and money I haven't got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more have I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to be done then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, only half believing his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
father's words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you must learn to stop at home, and not take expensive
journeys; and you must reduce your tailor's bill. I don't ask you
to help me in the management of the land--you're far too fine a
gentleman for that; but if you can't earn money, at least you needn't
spend it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've told you I'm willing enough to earn money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>cried Osborne,
passionately at last. <div class="bookquote">``But how am I to do it? You really are very
unreasonable, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire--cooling in manner, though not in temper, as
Osborne grew warm. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't set up for being reasonable; men who
have to pay away money that they haven't got for their extravagant
sons aren't likely to be reasonable. There's two things you've gone
and done which put me beside myself, when I think of them; you've
turned out next door to a dunce at college, when your poor mother
thought so much of you--and when you might have pleased and gratified
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so if you chose--and, well! I won't say what the other thing is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, almost breathless with the idea that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father had discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) secret marriage; but the father was
thinking of the money-lenders, who were calculating how soon Osborne
would come into the estate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``I know what I know; and I'm not going to
tell you how I know it. Only, I'll just say this--your friends no
more know a piece of good timber when they see it than you or I know
how you could earn five pounds if it was to keep you from starving.
Now, there's Roger--we none of us made an ado about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) Fellowship now, I'll warrant him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and be a bishop, or a
chancellor, or something, before we've found out he (<font color='blue'><b>chancellor</b></font>)'s clever--we've
been so much taken up thinking about you. I don't know what's come
over me to speak of `we'--`we' in this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), suddenly
dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) voice,--a change of tone as sad as sad could be. ``I
ought to say ``I;' it will be <div class="bookquote">``I' for evermore in this world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) got up and left the room in quick haste, knocking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) chair,
and not stopping to pick it up. Osborne, who was sitting and shading
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been doing for some time, looked up
at the noise, and then rose as quickly and hurried after his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father,
only in time to hear the study-door locked on the inside the moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) reached it.

<p/>Osborne returned into the dining-room chagrined and sorrowful. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
was always sensitive to any omission of the usual observances, which
might excite remark; and even with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heavy heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was careful to
pick up the fallen chair, and restore it to its place near the bottom
of the table; and afterwards so to disturb the dishes as to make it
appear that they had been touched, before ringing for Robinson. When
the latter came in, followed by Thomas, Osborne thought it necessary
to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) father was not well, and had gone into the
study; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) himself wanted no dessert, but would have a cup
of coffee in the drawing-room. The old butler sent Thomas out of the
room, and came up confidentially to Osborne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought master wasn't justly himself, Mr. Osborne, before dinner.
And, therefore, I made excuses for him (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)--I did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) spoke to Thomas
about the fire, sir, which is a thing I could in nowise put up
with, unless by reason of sickness, which I am always ready to make
allowances for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't my father speak to Thomas?''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``But,
perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) spoke angrily, I daresay; for I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)'s not well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, Mr. Osborne, it wasn't that. I myself am given to anger; and I'm
blessed with as good health as any man in my years. Besides, anger's
a good thing for Thomas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) needs a deal of it. But it should come
from the right quarter--and that is me, myself, Mr. Osborne. I know
my place, and I know my rights and duties as well as any butler that
lives. And it's my duty to scold Thomas, and not master's. Master
ought to have said, ``Robinson! you must speak to Thomas about letting
out the fire,<div class="bookquote">'' and I'd ha' given it him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) well,--as I shall do now,
for that matter. But as I said before, I make excuses for master,
as being in mental distress and bodily ill-health; so I've brought
myself round not to give warning, as I should ha' done, for certain,
under happier circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Robinson, I think it's all great nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne,
weary of the long story the butler had told him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>), and to which he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>)
had not half attended. <div class="bookquote">``What in the world does it signify whether
my father speaks to you or to Thomas? Bring me coffee in the
drawing-room, and don't trouble your head any more about scolding
Thomas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robinson</b></font>)</div><p/>Robinson went away offended at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) grievance being called nonsense.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) kept muttering to himself in the intervals of scolding Thomas, and
saying,--<div class="bookquote">``Things is a deal changed since poor missis went. I don't
wonder master feels it, for I'm sure I do. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was a lady who had
always a becoming respect for a butler's position, and could have
understood how he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) might be hurt in his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'d never ha' called
his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) delicacies of feelings nonsense--not she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>); no more would Mr.
Roger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s a merry young gentleman, and over fond of bringing dirty,
slimy creatures into the house; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s always a kind word for a man
who is hurt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d cheer up the Squire, and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) from
getting so cross and wilful. I wish Mr. Roger was here, I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor Squire, shut up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grief, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) ill-temper as well,
in the dingy, dreary study where he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) daily spent more and more of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) indoors life, turned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) cares and troubles till he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was as
bewildered with the process as a squirrel must be in going round in
a cage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had out day-books and ledgers, and was calculating up
back-rents; and every time the sum-totals came to different amounts.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could have cried like a child over his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sums; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was worn out and
weary, angry and disappointed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) books at last with a
bang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm getting old,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and my head's less clear than it used to
be. I think sorrow for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has dazed me. I never was much to boast

myself stupid; but, for all that, I am stupid. Osborne ought to help
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s had money enough spent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) learning; but, instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
comes down dressed like a popinjay, and never troubles his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head to
think how I'm to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) debts. I wish I'd told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
living as a dancing-master,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the squire, with a sad smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
own wit. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s dressed for all the world like one. And how he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s spent
the money no one knows! Perhaps Roger will turn up some day with a
heap of creditors at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) heels. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) won't--not Roger; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) may be
slow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s steady, is old Roger. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s not the
eldest son, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d take an interest in the estate; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d do up
these weary accounts for me. I wish Roger was here!''




 (<font color='red'><b>XXIII</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXIII.

<p/>OSBORNE HAMLEY REVIEWS HIS (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) POSITION.


<p/>Osborne had his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) solitary cup of coffee in the drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was
very unhappy too, after his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) stood on the hearth-rug
pondering over his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was not exactly aware how hardly
his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) father was pressed for ready-money; the Squire had never spoken
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) on the subject without being angry; and many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) loose
contradictory statements--all of which, however contradictory they
might appear, had their basis in truth--were set down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son
to the exaggeration of passion. But it was uncomfortable enough to
a young man of Osborne's age to feel himself continually hampered
for want of a five-pound note. The principal supplies for the
liberal--almost luxurious table at the Hall, came off the estate; so
that there was no appearance of poverty as far as the household went;
and as long as Osborne was content at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had everything he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could wish for; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a wife elsewhere--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
continually--and that necessitated journeys. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), poor thing! had to
be supported--where was the money for the journeys and for Aimée's
modest wants to come from? That was the puzzle in Osborne's mind
just now. While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been at college his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) allowance--heir of the
Hamleys--had been three hundred, while Roger had to be content with a
hundred less. The payment of these annual sums had given the Squire
a good deal of trouble; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought of it as a merely temporary
inconvenience; perhaps unreasonably thought so. Osborne was to
do great things; take high honours, get a fellowship, marry a
long-descended heiress, live in some of the many uninhabited rooms at
the Hall, and help the squire in the management of the estate that
would some time be his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>). Roger was to be a clergyman; steady, slow
Roger was just fitted for that, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) declined entering the
Church, preferring a life of more activity and adventure, Roger was
to be--anything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was useful and practical, and fit for all the
employments from which Osborne was shut out by his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) fastidiousness,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) -LRB-pseudo-RRB- genius; so it was well he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was an eldest son, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
would never have done to struggle through the world; and as for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
settling down to a profession, it would be like cutting blocks with
a razor! And now here was Osborne, living at home, but longing to be
elsewhere; his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) allowance stopped in reality; indeed, the punctual
payment of it during the last year or two had been owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
mother's exertions; but nothing had been said about its present
cessation by either father or son; money matters were too sore a
subject between them. Every now and then the Squire threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) a
ten-pound note or so; but the sort of suppressed growl with which it
was given, and the entire uncertainty as to when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might receive
such gifts, rendered any calculation based upon their receipt
exceedingly vague and uncertain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What in the world can I do to secure an income?''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>thought Osborne, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) stood on the hearth-rug, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) back to a blazing fire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) cup of
coffee sent up in the rare old china that had belonged to the Hall
for generations; his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) dress finished, as dress of Osborne's could
hardly fail to be. One could hardly have thought that this elegant
young man, standing there in the midst of comfort that verged on
luxury, should have been turning over that one great problem in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mind; but so it was. <div class="bookquote">``What can I do to be sure of a present income?
Things cannot go on as they are. I should need support for two or
three years, even if I entered myself at the Temple, or Lincoln's
Inn. It would be impossible to live on my pay in the army; besides,
I should hate that profession. In fact, there are evils attending all
professions--I couldn't bring myself to become a member of any I've
ever heard of. Perhaps I'm more fitted to take `orders' than anything
else; but to be compelled to write weekly sermons whether one had
anything to say or not, and, probably, doomed only to associate with
people below one in refinement and education! Yet poor Aimée must
have money. I can't bear to compare our dinners here, overloaded with
joints and game and sweets, as Morgan will persist in sending them
up, with Aimée's two little mutton-chops. Yet what would my father
say if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew I'd married a Frenchwoman? In his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) present mood he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d
disinherit me, if that is possible; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d speak about her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) in a way
I couldn't stand. A Roman Catholic, too! Well, I don't repent it. I'd
do it again. Only if my mother had been in good health--if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could
have heard my story, and known Aimée! As it is I must keep it secret;
but where to get money? Where to get money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bethought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poems--would they sell, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
in money? In spite of Milton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) thought they might; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) went to
fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) MSS. out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) sate down near the fire, trying to
study them with a critical eye, to represent public opinion as far as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) style since the Mrs. Hemans' days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>)
was essentially imitative in his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) poetic faculty; and of late he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) had
followed the lead of a popular writer of sonnets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) poems
over: they were almost equivalent to an autobiographical passage in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) life. Arranging them in their order, they came as follows:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Aimée, Walking with a Little Child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Aimée, Singing at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Aimée, Turning away from me while I told my Love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aimée's Confession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aimée in Despair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Foreign Land in which my Aimée dwells.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Wedding Ring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) came to this last sonnet he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) bundle of papers
and began to think. <div class="bookquote">``The wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>a wife</b></font>)</div>Yes, and a French wife; and a
Roman Catholic wife--and a wife who might be said to have been in
service! And his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) father's hatred of the French, both collectively
and individually--collectively, as tumultuous brutal ruffians,
who murdered their king, and committed all kinds of bloody
atrocities--individually, as represented by <div class="bookquote">``Boney,''  (<font color='red'><b>king</b></font>)</div>and the various
caricatures of <div class="bookquote">``Johnny Crapaud''  (<font color='red'><b>king</b></font>)</div>that had been in full circulation
about five-and-twenty years before this time, when the Squire had
been young and capable of receiving impressions. As for the form of
religion in which Mrs. Osborne Hamley had been brought up, it is
enough to say that Catholic emancipation had begun to be talked about
by some politicians, and that the sullen roar of the majority of
Englishmen, at the bare idea of it, was surging in the distance with
ominous threatenings; the very mention of such a measure before the
Squire was, as Osborne well knew, like shaking a red flag before a
bull.

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) considered that if Aimée had had the unspeakable, the
incomparable blessing of being born of English parents, in the very
heart of England--Warwickshire, for instance--and had never heard
of priests, or mass, or confession, or the Pope, or Guy Fawkes, but
had been born, baptized, and bred in the Church of England, without
having ever seen the outside of a dissenting meeting-house, or a
papist chapel--even with all these advantages, her (<font color='blue'><b>priests</b></font>) having been a
-LRB-what was the equivalent for <div class="bookquote">``bonne''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy Fawkes</b></font>)</div>in English? `nursery-governess'
was a term hardly invented-RRB- nursery-maid, with wages paid down once a
quarter, liable to be dismissed at a month's warning, and having her (<font color='blue'><b>priests</b></font>)
tea and sugar doled out to her (<font color='blue'><b>priests</b></font>), would be a shock to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawkes</b></font>) father's old
ancestral pride that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawkes</b></font>) would hardly ever get over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>thought Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) could but see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>But if
the Squire were to see Aimée, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would also hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) speak her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) pretty
broken English--precious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) husband, as it was in it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
had confessed brokenly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) English tongue, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
soundly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) French heart--and Squire Hamley piqued himself on
being a good hater of the French. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would make such a loving,
sweet, docile little daughter to my father--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would go as near as
any one could towards filling up the blank void in this house, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would but have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never would; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sha'n't have
the opportunity of scouting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Yet if I called her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ``Lucy' in these
sonnets; and if they made a great effect--were praised in _Blackwood_
and the _Quarterly_--and all the world was agog to find out the
author; and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) my secret--I could if I were successful--I
think then he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) would ask who Lucy was, and I could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) all then.
If--how I hate <div class="bookquote">``ifs.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If me no ifs.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My life has been based on
`whens;' and first they have turned to <div class="bookquote">``ifs,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and then they have
vanished away. It was `when Osborne gets honours,<div class="bookquote">'' and then `if
Osborne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>and then a failure altogether. I said to Aimée, `when my
mother sees you,<div class="bookquote">'' and now it is `if my father saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>with a very
faint prospect of its ever coming to pass.'' So he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) let the evening
hours flow on and disappear in reveries like these; winding up with
a sudden determination to try the fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) poems with a publisher,
with the direct expectation of getting money for them, and an
ulterior fancy that, if successful, they might work wonders with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
father.

<p/>When Roger came home Osborne did not let a day pass before telling
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) plans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) never did conceal anything long from
Roger; the feminine part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) character made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) always desirous of
a confidant, and as sweet sympathy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could extract. But Roger's
opinion had no effect on Osborne's actions; and Roger knew this full
well. So when Osborne began with--<div class="bookquote">``I want your advice on a plan
I have got in my head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>Roger replied: <div class="bookquote">``Some one told me that the
Duke of Wellington's maxim was never to give advice unless he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) could
enforce its being carried into effect; now I can't do that; and you
know, old boy, you don't follow out my advice when you've got it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always, I know. Not when it doesn't agree with my own opinion.
You're thinking about this concealment of my marriage; but you're
not up in all the circumstances. You know how fully I meant to have
done it, if there hadn't been that row about my debts; and then my
mother's illness and death. And now you've no conception how my
father is changed--how irritable he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has become! Wait till you've been
at home a week! Robinson, Morgan--it's the same with them all; but
worst of all with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger; <div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looked terribly changed:
shrunken, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ruddiness of complexion altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hardly takes half the exercise he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) used to do, so it's no
wonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has turned away all the men off the new works, which used
to be such an interest to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); and because the roan cob stumbled with
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) one day, and nearly threw him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) won't ride it; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) won't
sell it and buy another, which would be the sensible plan; so there
are two old horses eating their heads off, while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is constantly
talking about money and expense. And that brings me to what I was
going to say. I'm desperately hard up for money, and so I've been
collecting my poems--weeding them well, you know--going over them
quite critically, in fact; and I want to know if you think Deighton
would publish them. You've a name in Cambridge, you know; and I
daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would look at them if you offered them to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can but try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger; <div class="bookquote">``but I'm afraid you won't get much by
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't expect much. I'm a new man, and must make my name. I should
be content with a hundred. If I'd a hundred pounds I'd set myself to
do something. I might keep myself and Aimée by my writings while I
studied for the bar; or, if the worst came to the worst, a hundred
pounds would take us to Australia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Australia! Why, Osborne, what could you do there? And leave my
father! I hope you'll never get your hundred pounds, if that's the
use you're to make of it! Why, you'd break the Squire's heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It might have done once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, gloomily, <div class="bookquote">``but it wouldn't
now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) looks at me askance, and shies away from conversation with
me. Let me alone for noticing and feeling this kind of thing. It's
this very susceptibility to outward things that gives me what faculty
I have; and it seems to me as if my bread, and my wife's too, were to
depend upon it. You'll soon see for yourself the terms which I am on
with my father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger did soon see. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father had slipped into a habit of silence
at meal-times--a habit which Osborne, who was troubled and anxious
enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own part, had not striven to break. Father and son
sate together, and exchanged all the necessary speeches connected
with the occasion civilly enough; but it was a relief to them when
their intercourse was over, and they separated--the father to brood
over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sorrow and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disappointment, which were real and deep
enough, and the injury he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had received from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) boy, which was
exaggerated in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ignorance of the actual steps Osborne
had taken to raise money. If the money-lenders had calculated the
chances of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's life or death in making their bargain,
Osborne himself had thought only of how soon and how easily he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could
get the money requisite for clearing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from all imperious claims
at Cambridge, and for enabling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to follow Aimée to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) home in
Alsace, and for the subsequent marriage. As yet, Roger had never seen
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother's wife; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had only been taken into Osborne's
full confidence after all was decided in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) advice could have
been useful. And now, in the enforced separation, Osborne's whole
thought, both the poetical and practical sides of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind, ran
upon the little wife who was passing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lonely days in farmhouse
lodgings, wondering when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bridegroom husband would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
next. With such an engrossing subject, it was, perhaps, no wonder
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) unconsciously neglected his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father; but it was none the less
sad at the time, and to be regretted in its consequences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may come in and have a pipe with you, sir, mayn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger,
that first evening, pushing gently against the study-door, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
father held only half open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll not like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>said the squire, still holding the door against
him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), but speaking in a relenting tone. <div class="bookquote">``The tobacco I use isn't what
young men like. Better go and have a cigar with Osborne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I want to sit with you, and I can stand pretty strong tobacco.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger pushed in, the resistance slowly giving way before him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will make your clothes smell. You'll have to borrow Osborne's
scents to sweeten yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, grimly, at the same
time pushing a short smart amber-mouthed pipe to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I'll have a churchwarden. Why, father, do you think I'm a baby
to put up with a doll's head like this?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>looking at the carving upon
it.

<p/>The Squire was pleased in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heart, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not choose to
show it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``Osborne brought it me when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came back from
Germany. That's three years ago.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And then for some time they smoked
in silence. But the voluntary companionship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son was very
soothing to the Squire, though not a word might be said.

<p/>The next speech he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) made showed the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thoughts; indeed,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) words were always a transparent medium through which the current
might be seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A deal of a man's life comes and goes in three years--I've found
that out;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) puffed away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) pipe again. While Roger was
turning over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind what answer to make to this truism, the
squire again stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) smoking and spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember when there was all that fuss about the Prince of
Wales being made regent, I read somewhere--I daresay it was in a
newspaper--that kings and their heirs-apparent were always on bad
terms. Osborne was quite a little chap then: he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) used to go out riding
with me on White Surrey;--you won't remember the pony we called White
Surrey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember it; but I thought it a tall horse in those days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that was because you were such a small lad, you know. I'd seven
horses in the stable then--not counting the farm-horses. I don't
recollect having a care then, except--_she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)_ was always delicate, you
know. But what a beautiful boy Osborne was! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was always dressed in
black velvet--it was a foppery, but it wasn't my doing, and it was
all right, I'm sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a handsome fellow now, but the sunshine has
gone out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a good deal troubled about this money, and the anxiety he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has
given you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, rather taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother's feelings for
granted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, taking the pipe out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mouth, and
hitting the bowl so sharply against the hob that it broke in pieces.
``There! But never mind! I say, not he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), Roger! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s none troubled
about the money. It's easy getting money from Jews if you're the
eldest son, and the heir. They just ask, ``How old is your father, and
has he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a stroke, or a fit?<div class="bookquote">'' and it's settled out of hand, and
then they come prowling about a place, and running down the timber
and land--Don't let us speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); it's no good, Roger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and I
are out of tune, and it seems to me as if only God Almighty could
put us to rights. It's thinking of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) grieved _her (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)_ at last that
makes me so bitter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>). And yet there's a deal of good in him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>)!
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>)'s so quick and clever, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>)'d give his (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) mind to things.
Now, you were always slow, Roger--all your masters used to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger laughed a little--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I'd many a nickname at school for my slowness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, consolingly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't. If you
were a clever fellow like Osborne yonder, you'd be all for caring for
books and writing, and you'd perhaps find it as dull as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) does to
keep company with a bumpkin-squire Jones like me. Yet, I daresay,
they think a deal of you at Cambridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), after a pause,
<div class="bookquote">``since you've got this fine wranglership; I'd nearly forgotten
that--the news came at such a miserable time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes! They're always proud of the senior wrangler of the year
up at Cambridge. Next year I must abdicate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire sat and gazed into the embers, still holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) useless
pipe-stem. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said, in a low voice, as if scarcely aware he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
had got a listener,--<div class="bookquote">``I used to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was away in
London, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) the home news. But no letter will reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) now!
Nothing reaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a listener</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger started up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the tobacco-box, father? Let me fill you another pipe!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) stooped over his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father and stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
cheek. The Squire shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've only just come home, lad. You don't know me, as I am
now-a-days! Ask Robinson--I won't have you asking Osborne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) ought
to keep it to himself--but any of the servants will tell you I'm not
like the same man for getting into passions with them. I used to
be reckoned a good master, but that's past now! Osborne was once a
little boy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was once alive--and I was once a good master--a
good master--yes! It's all past now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) pipe, and began to smoke afresh, and Roger, after a
silence of some minutes, began a long story about some Cambridge
man's misadventure on the hunting-field, telling it with such humour
that the Squire was beguiled into hearty laughing. When they rose to
go to bed his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father said to Roger,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we've had a pleasant evening--at least, I have. But perhaps
you haven't; for I'm but poor company now, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know when I've passed a happier evening, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said
Roger. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke truly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not trouble himself to find
out the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) happiness.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIV.

<p/>MRS. GIBSON``S LITTLE DINNER.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>All this had taken place before Roger's first meeting with Molly and
Cynthia at Miss Brownings'; and the little dinner on the Friday at
Mr. Gibson's, which followed in due sequence.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson intended the Hamleys to find this dinner pleasant; and
they did. Mr. Gibson was fond of the two young men, both for their
parents' sake and their own, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had known them since boyhood; and
to those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) liked Mr. Gibson could be remarkably agreeable. Mrs.
Gibson really gave them a welcome--and cordiality in a hostess is a
very becoming mantle for any other deficiencies there may be. Cynthia
and Molly looked their best, which was all the duty Mrs. Gibson
absolutely required of them, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was willing enough to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
full share in the conversation. Osborne fell to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) lot, of course,
and for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) prattled on with all the ease of manner
and commonplaceness of meaning which go far to make the <div class="bookquote">``art of
polite conversation.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Roger, who ought to have made himself agreeable
to one or the other of the young ladies, was exceedingly interested
in what Mr. Gibson was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of a paper on comparative
osteology in some foreign journal of science, which Lord Hollingford
was in the habit of forwarding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) friend the country surgeon.
Yet, every now and then while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) listened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) attention
wandering to the face of Cynthia, who was placed between his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) brother
and Mr. Gibson. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was not particularly occupied with attending to
anything that was going on; her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyelids were carelessly dropped, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) crumbled her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) bread on the tablecloth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) beautiful long
eyelashes were seen on the clear tint of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) oval cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was
thinking of something else; Molly was trying to understand with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might. Suddenly Cynthia looked up, and caught Roger's gaze of
intent admiration too fully for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to be unaware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was staring
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) coloured a little; but, after the first moment of rosy
confusion at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) evident admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) flew to the attack,
diverting his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) confusion at thus being caught, to the defence of
himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) accusation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite true!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I was not attending: you see
I don't know even the A B C of science. But, please, don't look so
severely at me, even if I am a dunce!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know--I didn't mean to look severely, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), not knowing well what to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia is not a dunce either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, afraid lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
daughter's opinion of herself might be taken seriously. <div class="bookquote">``But I have
always observed that some people have a talent for one thing and
some for another. Now Cynthia's talents are not for science and the
severer studies. Do you remember, love, what trouble I had to teach
you the use of the globes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and I don't know longitude from latitude now; and I'm always
puzzled as to which is perpendicular and which is horizontal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet, I do assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mother continued, rather addressing
herself to Osborne, ``that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) memory for poetry is prodigious. I have
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) repeat the <div class="bookquote">``Prisoner of Chillon' from beginning to end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be rather a bore to have to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Gibson, smiling at Cynthia, who gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) back one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) bright looks
of mutual understanding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Mr. Gibson, I have found out before now that you have no soul
for poetry; and Molly there is your own child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) reads such deep
books--all about facts and figures: she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'ll be quite a blue-stocking
by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, reddening, <div class="bookquote">``you think it was a deep book because
there were the shapes of the different cells of bees in it! but it
was not at all deep. It was very interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``I stand up for blue-stockings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I object to the distinction implied in what you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said
Roger. <div class="bookquote">``It was not deep, _ergo_, it was very interesting. Now, a book
may be both deep and interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you are going to chop logic and use Latin words, I think it
is time for us to leave the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us run away as if we were beaten, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia.
``Though it may be logic, I, for one, can understand what Mr. Roger
Hamley said just now; and I read some of Molly's books; and whether
it was deep or not I found it very interesting--more so than I should
think the <div class="bookquote">``Prisoner of Chillon' now-a-days. I've displaced the
Prisoner to make room for Johnnie Gilpin as my favourite poem.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could you talk such nonsense, Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, as the
girls followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) upstairs. <div class="bookquote">``You know you are not a dunce. It is all
very well not to be a blue-stocking, because gentle-people don't like
that kind of woman; but running yourself down, and contradicting all
I said about your liking for Byron, and poets and poetry--to Osborne
Hamley of all men, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson spoke quite crossly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia replied, <div class="bookquote">``I am either a dunce, or I am not. If
I am, I did right to own it; if I am not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>)'s a dunce if he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) doesn't
find out I was joking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, a little puzzled by this speech, and
wanting some elucidatory addition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>)'s a dunce his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) opinion of me is worth nothing. So,
any way, it doesn't signify.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You really bewilder me with your nonsense, child. Molly is worth
twenty of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree with you, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, turning round to take
Molly's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ought not to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, still irritated.
<div class="bookquote">``Think of the advantages you've had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I had rather be a dunce than a blue-stocking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said
Molly; for the term had a little annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and the annoyance was
rankling still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush; here they are coming: I hear the dining-room door! I never
meant you were a blue-stocking, dear, so don't look vexed.--Cynthia,
my love, where did you get those lovely flowers--anemones, are they?
They suit your complexion so exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Molly, don't look so grave and thoughtful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Cynthia.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you perceive mamma wants us to be smiling and amiable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson had had to go out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) evening round; and the young men
were all too glad to come up into the pretty drawing-room; the bright
little wood-fire; the comfortable easy-chairs which, with so small
a party, might be drawn round the hearth; the good-natured hostess;
the pretty, agreeable girls. Roger sauntered up to the corner where
Cynthia was standing, playing with a hand-screen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a charity ball in Hollingford soon, isn't there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; on Easter Tuesday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going? I suppose you are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; mamma is going to take Molly and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will enjoy it very much--going together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For the first time during this little conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) glanced up at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)--real honest pleasure shining out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; going together will make the enjoyment of the thing. It would
be dull without her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are great friends, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought I should like any one so much,--any girl I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) put in the final reservation in all simplicity of heart; and in
all simplicity did he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) understand it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came ever so little nearer,
and dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was so anxious to know. I am so glad. I have often wondered how
you two were getting on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), looking up again. <div class="bookquote">``At Cambridge? You must be
very fond of Molly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was with us so long; and at such a time! I look upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) almost as a sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is very fond of all of you. I seem to know you all from
hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) talk about you so much.--All of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), laying an
emphasis on <div class="bookquote">``all''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to show that it included the dead as well as the
living. Roger was silent for a minute or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you, even by hearsay. So you mustn't wonder that I was
a little afraid. But as soon as I saw you I knew how it must be; and
it was such a relief!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, who thought that the younger son had had
quite his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) share of low, confidential conversation, <div class="bookquote">``come here, and
sing that little French ballad to Mr. Osborne Hamley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div><p/>``Which do you mean, mamma? <div class="bookquote">``Tu t`en repentiras, Colin?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; such a pretty, playful little warning to young men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gibson, smiling up at Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``The refrain is--

<p/>Tu t`en repentiras, Colin,
Tu t`en repentiras,
Car si tu prends une femme, Colin,
Tu t`en repentiras.

<p/>The advice may apply very well when there is a French wife in the
case; but not, I am sure, to an Englishman who is thinking of an
English wife.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: ``TU T<div class="bookquote">``EN REPENTIRAS, COLIN.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>This choice of a song was exceedingly _mal-àpropos_, had Mrs. Gibson
but known it. Osborne and Roger knowing that the wife of the former
was a Frenchwoman, and, conscious of each other's knowledge, felt
doubly awkward; while Molly was as much confused as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
herself were secretly married. However, Cynthia carolled the saucy
ditty out, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother smiled at it, in total ignorance of any
application it might have. Osborne had instinctively gone to stand
behind Cynthia, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) sate at the piano, so as to be ready to turn
over the leaves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) music if she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) required it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hands
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) fingers; his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) countenance
clouded with gravity at all the merry quips which she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) so playfully
sang. Roger looked grave as well, but was much more at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ease than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was half-amused by the awkwardness of the
situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) caught Molly's troubled eyes and heightened colour, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was feeling this _contretemps_ more seriously than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) needed to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) moved to a seat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and half whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Too
late a warning, is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) leant towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and replied in the
same tone--<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am so sorry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) won't mind it long; and a man must take the
consequences when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) puts himself in a false position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly could not tell what to reply to this, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head
and kept silence. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could see that Roger did not change his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
attitude or remove his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hand from the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) chair, and, impelled
by curiosity to find out the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) stillness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked up at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) at length, and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) gaze fixed on the two who were near the
piano. Osborne was saying something eagerly to Cynthia, whose grave
eyes were upturned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) with soft intentness of expression, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
pretty mouth half-open, with a sort of impatience for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to cease
speaking, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) might reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are talking about France,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, in answer to Molly's
unspoken question. <div class="bookquote">``Osborne knows it well, and Miss Kirkpatrick has
been at school there, you know. It sounds very interesting; shall we
go nearer and hear what they are saying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>It was all very well to ask this civilly, but Molly thought it would
have been better to wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) answer. Instead of waiting, however,
Roger went to the piano, and, leaning on it, appeared to join in the
light merry talk, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) feasted his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) dared by
looking at Cynthia. Molly suddenly felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could scarcely keep
from crying--a minute ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been so near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and talking so
pleasantly and confidentially; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) almost seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had
forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) existence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought that all this was wrong; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) exaggerated its wrongness to herself; <div class="bookquote">``mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``envious of
Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``ill-natured,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``selfish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were the terms she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) kept
applying to herself; but it did no good, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was just as naughty at
the last as at the first.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson broke into the state of things which Molly thought was to
endure for ever. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) work had been intricate up to this time, and had
required a great deal of counting; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had had no time to attend
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) duties, one of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) always took to be to show herself to
the world as an impartial stepmother. Cynthia had played and sung,
and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) must give Molly her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) turn of exhibition. Cynthia's singing
and playing was light and graceful, but anything but correct; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) herself was so charming, that it was only fanatics for music who
cared for false chords and omitted notes. Molly, on the contrary, had
an excellent ear, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had ever been well taught; and both from
inclination and conscientious perseverance of disposition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would
go over an incorrect passage for twenty times. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was very shy
of playing in company; and when forced to do it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went through her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
performance heavily, and hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) handiwork more than any one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you must play a little, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson; <div class="bookquote">``play us that
beautiful piece of Kalkbrenner's, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother with beseeching eyes; but it only
brought out another form of request, still more like a command.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go at once, my dear. You may not play it quite rightly; and I know
you are very nervous; but you're quite amongst friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So there was a disturbance made in the little group at the piano, and
Molly sate down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) martyrdom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to Osborne, who was standing behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
ready to turn over. <div class="bookquote">``I can quite well do it for myself. And oh! if
you would but talk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne remained where he (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) was in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) appeal, and gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) what little approval she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) got; for Mrs. Gibson, exhausted by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) previous labour of counting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stitches, fell asleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
comfortable sofa-corner near the fire; and Roger, who began at first
to talk a little in compliance with Molly's request, found his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
conversation with Cynthia so agreeable, that Molly lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) place
several times in trying to catch a sudden glimpse of Cynthia sitting
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) work, and Roger by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), intent on catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) low replies to
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was saying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, now I've done!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, standing up quickly as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had finished the eighteen dreary pages; <div class="bookquote">``and I think I will never
sit down to play again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) vehemence. Cynthia began to take some part
in what was being said, and thus made the conversation general. Mrs.
Gibson wakened up gracefully, as was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) way of doing all things, and
slid into the subjects they were talking about so easily, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
almost succeeded in making them believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had never been asleep at
all.




<p/>CHAPTER XXV.

<p/>HOLLINGFORD IN A BUSTLE.


<p/>All Hollingford felt as if there was a great deal to be done before
Easter this year. There was Easter proper, which always required new
clothing of some kind, for fear of certain consequences from little
birds, who were supposed to resent the impiety of those that did
not wear some new article of dress on Easter-day. And most ladies
considered it wiser that the little birds should see the new article
for themselves, and not have to take it upon trust, as they would
have to do if it were merely a pocket-handkerchief, or a petticoat,
or any article of under-clothing. So piety demanded a new bonnet, or
a new gown; and was barely satisfied with an Easter pair of gloves.
Miss Rose was generally very busy just before Easter in Hollingford.
Then this year there was the charity ball. Ashcombe, Hollingford, and
Coreham were three neighbouring towns, of about the same number of
population, lying at the three equidistant corners of a triangle. In
imitation of greater cities with their festivals, these three towns
had agreed to have an annual ball for the benefit of the county
hospital to be held in turn at each place; and Hollingford was to be
the place this year.

<p/>It was a fine time for hospitality, and every house of any pretension
was as full as it could hold, and flys were engaged long months
before.

<p/>If Mrs. Gibson could have asked Osborne, or in default, Roger Hamley
to go to the ball with them and to sleep at their house,--or if,
indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could have picked up any stray scion of a <div class="bookquote">``county family''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to whom such an offer would have been a convenience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would have
restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own dressing-room to its former use as the spare-room,
with pleasure. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not think it was worth her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) while to put
herself out for any of the humdrum and ill-dressed women who had been
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) former acquaintances at Ashcombe. For Mr. Preston it might have
been worth while to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) room, considering him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) in the light of
a handsome and prosperous young man, and a good dancer besides. But
there were more lights in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to be viewed. Mr. Gibson, who
really wanted to return the hospitality shown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) by Mr. Preston
at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) marriage, had yet an instinctive distaste to the
man, which no wish of freeing himself from obligation, nor even the
more worthy feeling of hospitality, could overcome. Mrs. Gibson
had some old grudges of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own against him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not one
to retain angry feelings, or be very active in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) retaliation;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was afraid of Mr. Preston, and admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) at the same time.
It was awkward too--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said--to go into a ball-room without
any gentleman at all, and Mr. Gibson was so uncertain! On the
whole--partly for this last-given reason, and partly because
conciliation was the best policy, Mrs. Gibson was slightly in favour
of inviting Mr. Preston to be their guest. But as soon as Cynthia
heard the question discussed--or rather, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) heard it
discussed in Mr. Gibson's absence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said that if Mr. Preston came
to be their visitor on the occasion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) for one would not go to the
ball at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not speak with vehemence or in anger; but with
such quiet resolution that Molly looked up in surprise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw
that Cynthia was keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) work, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
had no intention of meeting any one's gaze, or giving any further
explanation. Mrs. Gibson, too, looked perplexed, and once or twice
seemed on the point of asking some question; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not angry
as Molly had fully expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) watched Cynthia furtively and in
silence for a minute or two, and then said that, after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could
not conveniently give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dressing-room; and, altogether, they had
better say no more about it. So no stranger was invited to stay at
Mr. Gibson's at the time of the ball; but Mrs. Gibson openly spoke
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) regret at the unavoidable inhospitality, and hoped that they
might be able to build an addition to their house before the next
triennial Hollingford ball.

<p/>Another cause of unusual bustle at Hollingford this Easter was the
expected return of the family to the Towers, after their unusually
long absence. Mr. Sheepshanks might be seen trotting up and down on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) stout old cob, speaking to attentive masons, plasterers, and
glaziers about putting everything--on the outside at least--about
the cottages belonging to <div class="bookquote">``my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>glaziers</b></font>)</div>in perfect repair. Lord Cumnor
owned the greater part of the town; and those who lived under other
landlords, or in houses of their own, were stirred up by the dread
of contrast to do up their dwellings. So the ladders of whitewashers
and painters were sadly in the way of the ladies tripping daintily
along to make their purchases, and holding their gowns up in a bunch
behind, after a fashion quite gone out in these days. The housekeeper
and steward from the Towers might also be seen coming in to give
orders at the various shops; and stopping here and there at those
kept by favourites, to avail themselves of the eagerly-tendered
refreshments.

<p/>Lady Harriet came to call on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) old governess the day after the
arrival of the family at the Towers. Molly and Cynthia were out
walking when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came--doing some errands for Mrs. Gibson, who had a
secret idea that Lady Harriet would call at the particular time she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
did, and had a not uncommon wish to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ladyship without the
corrective presence of any member of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own family.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson did not give Molly the message of remembrance that Lady
Harriet had left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) imparted various pieces of news
relating to the Towers with great animation and interest. The Duchess
of Menteith and her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) daughter, Lady Alice, were coming to the Towers;
would be there the day of the ball; would come to the ball; and the
Menteith diamonds were famous. That was piece of news the first.
The second was that ever so many gentlemen were coming to the
Towers--some English, some French. This piece of news would have come
first in order of importance had there been much probability of their
being dancing men, and, as such, possible partners at the coming
ball. But Lady Harriet had spoken of them as Lord Hollingford's
friends, useless scientific men in all probability. Then, finally,
Mrs. Gibson was to go to the Towers next day to lunch; Lady Cumnor
had written a little note by Lady Harriet to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to come; if
Mrs. Gibson could manage to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) way to the Towers, one of the
carriages in use should bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own home in the course
of the afternoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dear countess!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, with soft affection. It was
a soliloquy, uttered after a minute's pause, at the end of all this
information.

<p/>And all the rest of that day her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) conversation had an aristocratic
perfume hanging about it. One of the few books she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had brought with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) into Mr. Gibson's house was bound in pink, and in it she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) studied
<div class="bookquote">``Menteith, Duke of, Adolphus George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>&c., &c., till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was fully up
in all the duchess's connections, and probable interests. Mr. Gibson
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mouth up into a droll whistle when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came home at night,
and found himself in a Towers' atmosphere. Molly saw the shade
of annoyance through the drollery; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was beginning to see it
oftener than she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) liked, not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) reasoned upon it, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
consciously traced the annoyance to its source; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not
help feeling uneasy in herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father was in the
least put out.

<p/>Of course a fly was ordered for Mrs. Gibson. In the early afternoon
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came home. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been disappointed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) interview with
the countess she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) woe, nor revealed the fact that when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) first arrived at the Towers she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had to wait for an hour in Lady
Cumnor's morning-room, uncheered by any companionship save that of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) old friend, Mrs. Bradley, till suddenly, Lady Harriet coming in,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Why, Clare! you dear woman! are you here all alone?
Does mamma know?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And, after a little more affectionate conversation,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) rushed to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ladyship, who was perfectly aware of the fact,
but too deep in giving the duchess the benefit of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) wisdom and
experience in trousseaux to be at all aware of the length of time
Mrs. Gibson had been passing in patient solitude. At lunch Mrs.
Gibson was secretly hurt by my lord's supposing it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) dinner,
and calling out his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) urgent hospitality from the very bottom of the
table, giving as a reason for it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) must remember it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
dinner. In vain she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) piped out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) soft, high voice, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my lord!
I never eat meat in the middle of the day; I can hardly eat anything
at lunch.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) voice was lost, and the duchess might go away with the
idea that the Hollingford doctor's wife dined early; that is to say,
if her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grace ever condescended to have any idea on the subject at
all; which presupposes that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was cognizant of the fact of there
being a doctor at Hollingford, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had a wife, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
wife was the pretty, faded, elegant-looking woman sending away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
plate of untasted food--food which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) longed to eat, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
really desperately hungry after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drive and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) solitude.

<p/>And then after lunch there did come a _tête-à-tête_ with Lady Cumnor,
which was conducted after this wise:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Clare! I am really glad to see you. I once thought I should
never get back to the Towers, but here I am! There was such a clever
man at Bath--a Doctor Snape--he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cured me at last--quite set me up. I
really think if ever I am ill again I shall send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>): it is such
a thing to find a really clever medical man. Oh, by the way, I always
forget you've married Mr. Gibson--of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is very clever, and
all that. -LRB-The carriage to the door in ten minutes, Brown, and desire
Bradley to bring my things down.-RRB- What was I asking you? Oh! how do
you get on with the stepdaughter? She (<font color='blue'><b>stepdaughter</b></font>) seemed to me to be a young lady
with a pretty stubborn will of her (<font color='blue'><b>stepdaughter</b></font>) own. I put a letter for the post
down somewhere, and I cannot think where; do help me look for it,
there's a good woman. Just run to my room, and see if Brown can find
it, for it is of great consequence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/>Off went Mrs. Gibson, rather unwillingly; for there were several
things she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wanted to speak about, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had not heard half of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had expected to learn of the family gossip. But all chance was
gone; for when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fruitless errand, Lady Cumnor
and the duchess were in full talk, Lady Cumnor with the missing
letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) hand, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was using something like a baton to
enforce her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every iota from Paris! Every i-o-ta!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Cumnor was too much of a lady not to apologize for useless
trouble, but they were nearly the last words she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke to Mrs.
Gibson, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had to go out and drive with the duchess; and the
brougham to take <div class="bookquote">``Clare''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) persisted in calling Mrs. Gibson-RRB-
back to Hollingford followed the carriage to the door. Lady Harriet
came away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) _entourage_ of young men and young ladies, all
prepared for some walking expedition, to wish Mrs. Gibson good-by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall see you at the ball,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be there with your
two girls, of course, and I must have a little talk with you there;
with all these visitors in the house, it has been impossible to see
anything of you to-day, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Such were the facts, but rose-colour was the medium through which
they were seen by Mrs. Gibson's household listeners on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are many visitors staying at the Towers--oh, yes! a great
many: the duchess and Lady Alice, and Mr. and Mrs. Grey, and Lord
Albert Monson and his (<font color='blue'><b>Monson</b></font>) sister, and my old friend Captain James of the
Blues--many more, in fact. But, of course, I preferred going to Lady
Cumnor's own room, where I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) and Lady Harriet quietly,
and where we were not disturbed by the bustle downstairs. Of course
we were obliged to go down to lunch, and then I saw my old friends,
and renewed pleasant acquaintances. But I really could hardly get any
connected conversation with any one. Lord Cumnor seemed so delighted
to see me there again: though there were six or seven between us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
was always interrupting with some civil or kind speech especially
addressed to me. And after lunch Lady Cumnor asked me all sorts of
questions about my new life with as much interest as if I had been
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) daughter. To be sure, when the duchess came in we had to leave
off, and talk about the trousseau she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) is preparing for Lady Alice.
Lady Harriet made such a point of our meeting at the ball; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is
such a good, affectionate creature, is Lady Harriet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This last was said in a tone of meditative appreciation.

<p/>The afternoon of the day on which the ball was to take place, a
servant rode over from Hamley with two lovely nosegays, <div class="bookquote">``with the
Mr. Hamleys' compliments to Miss Gibson and Miss Kirkpatrick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia was the first to receive them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) came dancing into the
drawing-room, flourishing the flowers about in either hand, and
danced up to Molly, who was trying to settle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) reading, by way
of passing the time away till the evening came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, Molly, look! Here are bouquets for us! Long life to the
givers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are they from?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, taking hold of one, and examining
it with tender delight at its beauty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who from? Why, the two paragons of Hamleys, to be sure. Is it not a
pretty attention?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How kind of them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure it is Osborne who thought of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) has been so much
abroad, where it is such a common compliment to send bouquets to
young ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why you should think it is Osborne's thought!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said
Molly, reddening a little. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Roger Hamley used to gather nosegays
constantly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mother, and sometimes for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, never mind whose thought it was, or who gathered them; we've
got the flowers, and that's enough. Molly, I'm sure these red flowers
will just match your coral necklace and bracelets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia,
pulling out some camellias, then a rare kind of flower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see how carefully
the colours are arranged--they have taken such pains; please, don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, continuing to pull them out; <div class="bookquote">``see, here are
quite enough. I'll make you a little coronet of them--sewn on black
velvet, which will never be seen--just as they do in France!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am so sorry! It is quite spoilt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind! I'll take this spoilt bouquet; I can make it up again
just as prettily as ever; and you shall have this, which has never
been touched.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia went on arranging the crimson buds and flowers
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) taste. Molly said nothing, but kept watching Cynthia's nimble
fingers tying up the wreath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, at last, <div class="bookquote">``when that is sewn on black velvet,
to keep the flowers from dying, you'll see how pretty it will look.
And there are enough red flowers in this untouched nosegay to carry
out the idea!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-very slowly-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``But sha'n't you mind having only the
wrecks of the other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I; red flowers would not go with my pink dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--I daresay they arranged each nosegay so carefully!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they did. But I never would allow sentiment to interfere
with my choice of colours; and pink does tie one down. Now you,
in white muslin, just tipped with crimson, like a daisy, may wear
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia took the utmost pains in dressing Molly, leaving the clever
housemaid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's exclusive service. Mrs. Gibson was more
anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) attire than was either of the girls; it had given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) occasion for deep thought and not a few sighs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) deliberation
had ended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) pearl-grey satin wedding-gown, with a
profusion of lace, and white and coloured lilacs. Cynthia was the one
who took the affair most lightly. Molly looked upon the ceremony of
dressing for a first ball as rather a serious ceremony; certainly as
an anxious proceeding. Cynthia was almost as anxious as herself; only
Molly wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) appearance to be correct and unnoticed; and Cynthia
was desirous of setting off Molly's rather peculiar charms--her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
cream-coloured skin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) profusion of curly black hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) beautiful
long-shaped eyes, with their shy, loving expression. Cynthia took
up so much time in dressing Molly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mind, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) herself had
to perform her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) toilette in a hurry. Molly, ready dressed, sate on a
low chair in Cynthia's room, watching the pretty creature's rapid
movements, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) petticoat before the glass, doing up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hair, with quick certainty of effect. At length, Molly heaved a
long sigh, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to be pretty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, turning round with an exclamation on the
tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tongue; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) caught the innocent, wistful look on
Molly's face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) instinctively checked what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was going to say,
and, half-smiling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own reflection in the glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``The
French girls would tell you, to believe that you were pretty would
make you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly paused before replying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose they would mean that if you knew you were pretty, you
would never think about your looks; you would be so certain of being
liked, and that it is caring--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen! that's eight o'clock striking. Don't trouble yourself with
trying to interpret a French girl's meaning, but help me on with my
frock, there's a dear one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>The two girls were dressed, and were standing over the fire waiting
for the carriage in Cynthia's room, when Maria -LRB-Betty's successor-RRB-
came hurrying into the room. Maria had been officiating as maid to
Mrs. Gibson, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had had intervals of leisure, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
rushed upstairs, and, under the pretence of offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) services,
had seen the young ladies' dresses, and the sight of so many nice
clothes had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) into a state of excitement which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) think
nothing of rushing upstairs for the twentieth time, with a nosegay
still more beautiful than the two previous ones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Miss Kirkpatrick! No, it's not for you, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>as Molly, being
nearer to the door, offered to take it and pass it to Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``It's
for Miss Kirkpatrick; and there's a note for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) besides!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia said nothing, but took the note and the flowers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) held the
note so that Molly could read it at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did.


<p/>I send you some flowers; and you must allow me to claim
the first dance after nine o'clock, before which time I
fear I cannot arrive.--R. P.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>R.</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/>Cynthia looked extremely irritated, indignant, perplexed--what was it
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cheek so pale, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes so full of fire?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Mr. Preston,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), in answer to Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I shall not dance
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); and here go his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) flowers--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Into the very middle of the embers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) immediately stirred
down upon the beautiful shrivelling petals as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wished to
annihilate them as soon as possible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) voice had never been raised;
it was as sweet as usual; nor, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) movements were prompt
enough, were they hasty or violent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``those beautiful flowers! We might have put them in
water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia; <div class="bookquote">``it's best to destroy them. We don't want them;
and I can't bear to be reminded of that man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was an impertinent familiar note,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``What right had
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to express himself in that way--no beginning, no end, and only
initials! Did you know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) well when you were at Ashcombe, Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't let us think any more about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>replied Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``It is
quite enough to spoil any pleasure at the ball to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will
be there. But I hope I shall get engaged before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes, so that I
can't dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--and don't you, either!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There! they are calling for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Molly, and with quick
step, yet careful of their draperies, they made their way downstairs
to the place where Mr. and Mrs. Gibson awaited them. Yes; Mr. Gibson
was going,--even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had to leave them afterwards to attend to any
professional call. And Molly suddenly began to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father
as a handsome man, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, in full evening attire.
Mrs. Gibson, too--how pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was! In short, it was true that no
better-looking a party than these four people entered the Hollingford
ball-room that evening.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVI.

<p/>A CHARITY BALL.


<p/>At the present time there are few people at a public ball besides the
dancers and their chaperones, or relations in some degree interested
in them. But in the days when Molly and Cynthia were young--before
railroads were, and before their consequences, the excursion-trains,
which take every one up to London now-a-days, there to see their fill
of gay crowds and fine dresses--to go to an annual charity-ball, even
though all thought of dancing had passed by years ago, and without
any of the responsibilities of a chaperone, was a very allowable
and favourite piece of dissipation to all the kindly old maids who
thronged the country towns of England. They aired their old lace and
their best dresses; they saw the aristocratic magnates of the country
side; they gossipped with their coevals, and speculated on the
romances of the young around them in a curious yet friendly spirit.
The Miss Brownings would have thought themselves sadly defrauded
of the gayest event of the year, if anything had prevented their
attending the charity ball, and Miss Browning would have been
indignant, Miss Phoebe aggrieved, had they not been asked to
Ashcombe and Coreham, by friends at each place, who had, like them,
gone through the dancing-stage of life some five-and-twenty years
before, but who liked still to haunt the scenes of their former
enjoyment, and see a younger generation dance on <div class="bookquote">``regardless of their
doom.''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>They had come in one of the two sedan-chairs that yet lingered
in use at Hollingford; such a night as this brought a regular harvest
of gains to the two old men who, in what was called the <div class="bookquote">``town's
livery,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>trotted backwards and forwards with their many loads of
ladies and finery. There were some postchaises, and some <div class="bookquote">``flys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>but
after mature deliberation Miss Browning had decided to keep to the
more comfortable custom of the sedan-chair; <div class="bookquote">``which,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) said to
Miss Piper, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) visitors, <div class="bookquote">``came into the parlour, and got full
of the warm air, and nipped you up, and carried you tight and cosy
into another warm room, where you could walk out without having to
show your legs by going up steps, or down steps.''  (<font color='red'><b>visitors</b></font>)</div>Of course only one
could go at a time; but here again a little of Miss Browning's good
management arranged everything so very nicely, as Miss Hornblower
-LRB-their other visitor-RRB- remarked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hornblower</b></font>) went first, and remained in the
warm cloak-room until her (<font color='blue'><b>Hornblower</b></font>) hostess followed; and then the two ladies
went arm-in-arm into the ball-room, finding out convenient seats
whence they could watch the arrivals and speak to their passing
friends, until Miss Phoebe and Miss Piper entered, and came to take
possession of the seats reserved for them by Miss Browning's care.
These two younger ladies came in, also arm-in-arm, but with a certain
timid flurry in look and movement very different from the composed
dignity of their seniors -LRB-by two or three years-RRB-. When all four
were once more assembled together, they took breath, and began to
converse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I really do think this is a better room than our
Ashcombe Court-house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how prettily it is decorated!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Piper</b></font>)</div>piped out Miss Piper. <div class="bookquote">``How well
the roses are made! But you all have such taste at Hollingford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Mrs. Dempster,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Hornblower</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Hornblower; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>)
two daughters were asked to stay at Mr. Sheepshanks'. Mr. Preston
was to be there, too; but I suppose they could not all come at once.
Look! and there is young Roscoe, our new doctor. I declare it seems
as if all Ashcombe were here. Mr. Roscoe! Mr. Roscoe! come here and
let me introduce you to Miss Browning, the friend we are staying
with. We think very highly of our young doctor, I can assure you,
Miss Browning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Hornblower</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Roscoe bowed, and simpered at hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Roscoe</b></font>) own praises. But Miss
Browning had no notion of having any doctor praised, who had come to
settle on the very verge of Mr. Gibson's practice, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) said to
Miss Hornblower,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be glad, I am sure, to have somebody you can call in, if
you are in any sudden hurry, or for things that are too trifling
to trouble Mr. Gibson about; and I should think Mr. Roscoe would
feel it a great advantage to profit, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roscoe</b></font>) will naturally have the
opportunity of doing, by witnessing Mr. Gibson's skill!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Hornblower</b></font>)</div><p/>Probably Mr. Roscoe would have felt more aggrieved by this speech
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Roscoe</b></font>) really was, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Roscoe</b></font>) attention had not been called off just
then by the entrance of the very Mr. Gibson who was being spoken of.
Almost before Miss Browning had ended her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) severe and depreciatory
remarks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) friend Miss Hornblower,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that lovely girl in pink, just come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Hornblower</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that's Cynthia Kirkpatrick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Hornblower</b></font>)</div>said Miss Hornblower, taking up a
ponderous gold eyeglass to make sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hornblower</b></font>) fact. <div class="bookquote">``How she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) has grown!
To be sure, it is two or three years since she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) left Ashcombe--she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was
very pretty then--people did say Mr. Preston admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) very much;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was so young!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you introduce me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>asked the impatient young surgeon. <div class="bookquote">``I should
like to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) to dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Hornblower</b></font>)</div><p/>When Miss Hornblower returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hornblower</b></font>) greeting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hornblower</b></font>) former
acquaintance, Mrs. Gibson, and had accomplished the introduction
which Mr. Roscoe had requested, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) began her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) little confidences to
Miss Browning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to be sure! How condescending we are! I remember the time when
Mrs. Kirkpatrick wore old black silks, and was thankful and civil
as became her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) place as a schoolmistress, and as having to earn her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
bread. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) is in a satin; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) speaks to me as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
just could recollect who I was, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) tried very hard! It isn't so
long ago since Mrs. Dempster came to consult me as to whether Mrs.
Kirkpatrick would be offended, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) a new breadth for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) lilac silk-gown, in place of one that had been spoilt by Mrs.
Dempster's servant spilling the coffee over it the night before; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) took it and was thankful, for all she (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>)'s dressed in pearl-grey
satin now! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) would have been glad enough to marry Mr. Preston
in those days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>put in Miss Browning to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) irritated friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! perhaps I did, and perhaps it was so; I'm sure I can't tell;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was a great deal at the house. Miss Dixon keeps a school in the
same house now, and I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) does it a great deal better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The earl and the countess are very fond of Mrs. Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning. <div class="bookquote">``I know, for Lady Harriet told us when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) came to drink
tea with us last autumn; and they desired Mr. Preston to be very
attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) lived at Ashcombe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For goodness' sake don't go and repeat what I've been saying
about Mr. Preston and Mrs. Kirkpatrick to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) ladyship. One may be
mistaken, and you know I only said `people talked about it.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Hornblower</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Hornblower was evidently alarmed lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Hornblower</b></font>) gossip should be
repeated to the Lady Harriet, who appeared to be on such an intimate
footing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) Hollingford friends. Nor did Miss Browning dissipate
the illusion. Lady Harriet had drunk tea with them, and might do it
again; and, at any rate, the little fright she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend
into was not a bad return for that praise of Mr. Roscoe, which had
offended Miss Browning's loyalty to Mr. Gibson.

<p/>Meanwhile Miss Piper and Miss Phoebe, who had not the character of
_esprit-forts_ to maintain, talked of the dresses of the people
present, beginning by complimenting each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a lovely turban you have got on, Miss Piper, if I may be
allowed to say so: so becoming to your complexion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Piper</b></font>)</div>said Miss Piper, with ill-concealed gratification;
it was something to have a <div class="bookquote">``complexion''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Piper</b></font>)</div>at forty-five. <div class="bookquote">``I got it
at Brown's, at Somerton, for this very ball. I thought I must have
something to set off my gown, which isn't quite so new as it once
was; and I have no handsome jewellery like you'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>--looking with
admiring eyes at a large miniature set round with pearls, which
served as a shield to Miss Phoebe's breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is handsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>that lady replied. <div class="bookquote">``It is a likeness of my dear
mother; Dorothy has got my father on. The miniatures were both taken
at the same time; and just about then my uncle died and left us each
a legacy of fifty pounds, which we agreed to spend on the setting of
our miniatures. But because they are so valuable Dorothy always keeps
them locked up with the best silver, and hides the box somewhere; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>)
never will tell me where, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) says I've such weak nerves, and
that if a burglar, with a loaded pistol at my head, were to ask me
where we kept our plate and jewels, I should be sure to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>burglar</b></font>); and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) says, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) part, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) would never think of revealing under any
circumstances. -LRB-I'm sure I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) won't be tried.-RRB- But that's the
reason I don't wear it often; it's only the second time I've had it
on; and I can't even get at it, and look at it, which I should like
to do. I shouldn't have had it on to-night, but that Dorothy gave
it out to me, saying it was but a proper compliment to pay to the
Duchess of Menteith, who is to be here in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) diamonds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear-ah-me! Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) really! Do you know I never saw a duchess
before.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Piper</b></font>)</div>And Miss Piper drew herself up and craned her (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) neck, as if
resolved to <div class="bookquote">``behave herself properly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Piper</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) had been taught to
do at boarding-school thirty years before, in the presence of <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)
grace.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>By-and-by she (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) said to Miss Phoebe, with a sudden jerk out
of position,--<div class="bookquote">``Look, look! that's our Mr. Cholmley, the magistrate''
 (<font color='red'><b>a jerk</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) was the great man of Coreham-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and that's Mrs. Cholmley in red
satin, and Mr. George and Mr. Harry from Oxford, I do declare; and
Miss Cholmley, and pretty Miss Sophy. I should like to go and speak
to them, but then it's so formidable crossing a room without a
gentleman. And there is Coxe the butcher and his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) wife! Why all
Coreham seems to be here! And how Mrs. Coxe can afford such a gown I
can't make out for one, for I know Coxe had some difficulty in paying
for the last sheep he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) bought of my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Just at this moment the band, consisting of two violins, a harp, and
an occasional clarionet, having finished their tuning, and brought
themselves as nearly into accord as was possible, struck up a brisk
country-dance, and partners quickly took their places. Mrs. Gibson
was secretly a little annoyed at Cynthia's being one of those
to stand up in this early dance, the performers in which were
principally the punctual plebeians of Hollingford, who, when a ball
was fixed to begin at eight, had no notion of being later, and so
losing part of the amusement for which they had paid their money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
imparted some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) feelings to Molly, sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), longing to
dance, and beating time to the spirited music with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) pretty
little feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your dear papa is always so very punctual! To-night it seems almost
a pity, for we really are here before there is any one come that we
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I see so many people here that I know. There are Mr. and Mrs.
Smeaton, and that nice good-tempered daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! booksellers and butchers if you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa has found a great many friends to talk to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Patients, my dear--hardly friends. There are some nice-looking
people here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eye on the Cholmleys; <div class="bookquote">``but I daresay they
have driven over from the neighbourhood of Ashcombe or Coreham, and
have hardly calculated how soon they would get here. I wonder when
the Towers' party will come. Ah! there's Mr. Ashton, and Mr. Preston.
Come, the room is beginning to fill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>So it was, for this was to be a very good ball, people said; and a
large party from the Towers was coming, and a duchess in diamonds
among the number. Every great house in the district was expected to
be full of guests on these occasions; but at this early hour, the
townspeople had the floor almost entirely to themselves; the county
magnates came dropping in later; and chiefest among them all was the
lord-lieutenant from the Towers. But to-night they were unusually
late, and the aristocratic ozone being absent from the atmosphere,
there was a flatness about the dancing of all those who considered
themselves above the plebeian ranks of the tradespeople. They,
however, enjoyed themselves thoroughly, and sprang and bounded
till their eyes sparkled and their cheeks glowed with exercise and
excitement. Some of the more prudent parents, mindful of the next
day's duties, began to consider at what hour they ought to go home;
but with all there was an expressed or unexpressed curiosity to
see the duchess and her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) diamonds; for the Menteith diamonds were
famous in higher circles than that now assembled; and their fame
had trickled down to it through the medium of ladies'-maids and
housekeepers. Mr. Gibson had had to leave the ball-room for a time,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had anticipated, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife as soon as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) duties were accomplished; and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) absence, Mrs. Gibson kept
herself a little aloof from the Miss Brownings and those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
acquaintance who would willingly have entered into conversation with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), with the view of attaching herself to the skirts of the Towers'
party, when they should make their appearance. If Cynthia would not
be so very ready in engaging herself to every possible partner who
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to dance, there were sure to be young men staying at the
Towers who would be on the look-out for pretty girls: and who could
tell to what a dance might lead? Molly, too, though not so good a
dancer as Cynthia, and, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) timidity, less graceful and easy,
was becoming engaged pretty deeply; and, it must be confessed,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was longing to dance every dance, no matter with whom. Even
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) might not be available for the more aristocratic partners Mrs.
Gibson anticipated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was feeling very much annoyed with the whole
proceedings of the evening when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was aware of some one standing by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); and, turning a little to one side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) saw Mr. Preston keeping
guard, as it were, over the seats which Molly and Cynthia had just
quitted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was looking so black that, if their eyes had not met,
Mrs. Gibson would have preferred not speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
thought it unavoidable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The rooms are not well-lighted to-night, are they, Mr. Preston?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but who could light such dingy old paint as this,
loaded with evergreens, too, which always darken a room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the company, too! I always think that freshness and brilliancy
of dress go as far as anything to brighten up a room. Look what a set
of people are here: the greater part of the women are dressed in
dark silks, really only fit for a morning. The place will be quite
different, by-and-by, when the county families are in a little more
force.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Preston made no reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) eye,
apparently for the purpose of watching the dancers. If its exact
direction could have been ascertained, it would have been found
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was looking intently and angrily at a flying figure in pink
muslin: many a one was gazing at Cynthia with intentness besides
himself, but no one in anger. Mrs. Gibson was not so fine an observer
as to read all this; but here was a gentlemanly and handsome young
man, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could prattle, instead of either joining herself on
to objectionable people, or sitting all forlorn until the Towers'
party came. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) small remarks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not dancing, Mr. Preston!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! The partner I had engaged has made some mistake. I am waiting to
have an explanation with her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson was silent. An uncomfortable tide of recollections
appeared to come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), like Mr. Preston, watched Cynthia;
the dance was ended, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was walking round the room in easy
unconcern as to what might await her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Presently her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) partner, Mr.
Harry Cholmley, brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) seat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) took that vacant
next to Mr. Preston, leaving the one by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother for Molly's
occupation. The latter returned a moment afterwards to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) place.
Cynthia seemed entirely unconscious of Mr. Preston's neighbourhood.
Mrs. Gibson leaned forwards, and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your last partner was a gentleman, my dear. You are improving in
your selection. I really was ashamed of you before, figuring away
with that attorney's clerk. Molly, do you know whom you have been
dancing with? I have found out he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) is the Coreham bookseller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That accounts for his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) being so well up in all the books I've been
wanting to hear about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, eagerly, but with a spice of
malice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) really was very pleasant, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) added;
<div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) looks quite a gentleman, and dances beautifully!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. But remember if you go on this way you will have to shake
hands over the counter to-morrow morning with some of your partners
of to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I really don't know how to refuse when people are introduced
to me and ask me, and I am longing to dance. You know to-night it
is a charity ball, and papa said everybody danced with everybody,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in a pleading tone of voice; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could not quite
thoroughly enjoy herself if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was out of harmony with any one.
What reply Mrs. Gibson would have made to this speech cannot now
be ascertained; for, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could answer, Mr. Preston stepped
a little forwards, and said, in a tone which he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) meant to be icily
indifferent, but which trembled with anger,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Miss Gibson finds any difficulty in refusing a partner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) has
only to apply to Miss Kirkpatrick for instructions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) beautiful eyes, and, fixing them on Mr.
Preston's face, said, very quietly, as if only stating a matter of
fact,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget, I think, Mr. Preston: Miss Gibson implied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
wished to dance with the person who asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)--that makes all the
difference. I can't instruct her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) how to act in that difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>And to the rest of this little conversation, Cynthia appeared to lend
no ear; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was almost directly claimed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) next partner. Mr.
Preston took the seat now left empty much to Molly's annoyance. At
first she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) feared lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) might be going to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to dance; but,
instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) hand for Cynthia's nosegay, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
left on rising, entrusted to Molly. It had suffered considerably from
the heat of the room, and was no longer full and fresh; not so much
so as Molly's, which had not, in the first instance, been pulled to
pieces in picking out the scarlet flowers which now adorned Molly's
hair, and which had since been cherished with more care. Enough,
however, remained of Cynthia's to show very distinctly that it was
not the one Mr. Preston had sent; and it was perhaps to convince
himself of this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) rudely asked to examine it. But Molly,
faithful to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) imagined would be Cynthia's wish, refused to
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) to touch it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) only held it a little nearer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Kirkpatrick has not done me the honour of wearing the bouquet
I sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), I see. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) received it, I suppose, and my note?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, rather intimidated by the tone in which this was
said. <div class="bookquote">``But we had already accepted these two nosegays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson was just the person to come to the rescue with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
honeyed words on such an occasion as the present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) evidently was
rather afraid of Mr. Preston, and wished to keep at peace with him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, we were so sorry! Of course, I don't mean to say we could
be sorry for any one's kindness; but two such lovely nosegays had
been sent from Hamley Hall--you may see how beautiful from what Molly
holds in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand--and they had come before yours, Mr. Preston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have felt honoured if you had accepted of mine, since
the young ladies were so well provided for. I was at some pains in
selecting the flowers at Green's; I think I may say it was rather
more recherché than that of Miss Kirkpatrick's, which Miss Gibson
holds so tenderly and securely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, because Cynthia would take out the most effective flowers to put
in my hair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Molly, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Preston, with a certain accent of pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
voice, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) were glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) set so little store by the nosegay;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) walked off to stand behind Cynthia in the quadrille that was
being danced; and Molly saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) making her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) reply to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)--against her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
will, Molly was sure. But, somehow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) face and manner implied power
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked grave, deaf, indifferent, indignant, defiant;
but, after a half-whispered speech to Cynthia, at the conclusion
of the dance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) evidently threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) an impatient consent to what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was asking, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) walked off with a disagreeable smile of
satisfaction on his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) handsome face.

<p/>All this time the murmurs were spreading at the lateness of the party
from the Towers, and person after person came up to Mrs. Gibson as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) were the accredited authority as to the earl and countess's
plans. In one sense this was flattering; but then the acknowledgment
of common ignorance and wonder reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to the level of the
inquirers. Mrs. Goodenough felt herself particularly aggrieved; she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>)
had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) spectacles on for the last hour and a half, in order to
be ready for the sight the very first minute any one from the Towers
appeared at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a headache,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) complained, <div class="bookquote">``and I should have sent my money,
and never stirred out o' doors to-night; for I've seen a many of
these here balls, and my lord and my lady too, when they were better
worth looking at nor they are now; but every one was talking of the
duchess, and the duchess and her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) diamonds, and I thought I shouldn't
like to be behindhand, and never ha' seen neither the duchess nor
her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) diamonds; so I'm here, and coal and candle-light wasting away
at home, for I told Sally to sit up for me; and, above everything,
I cannot abide waste. I took it from my mother, who was such a one
against waste as you never see now-a-days. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a manager, if
ever there was a one; and brought up nine children on less than
any one else could do, I'll be bound. Why! she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wouldn't let us be
extravagant--not even in the matter of colds. Whenever any on us had
got a pretty bad cold, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took the opportunity and cut our hair; for
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), it was of no use having two colds when one would
do--and cutting of our hair was sure to give us a cold. But, for all
that, I wish the duchess would come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but fancy what it is to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>sighed out Mrs. Gibson; <div class="bookquote">``so long as
I have been without seeing the dear family--and seeing so little of
them the other day when I was at the Towers -LRB-for the duchess would
have my opinion on Lady Alice's trousseau, and kept asking me so many
questions it took up all the time-RRB---and Lady Harriet's last words
were a happy anticipation of our meeting to-night. It's nearly twelve
o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Every one of any pretensions to gentility was painfully affected by
the absence of the family from the Towers; the very fiddlers seemed
unwilling to begin playing a dance that might be interrupted by the
entrance of the great folks. Miss Phoebe Browning had apologized
for them--Miss Browning had blamed them with calm dignity; it was
only the butchers and bakers and candlestick-makers who rather
enjoyed the absence of restraint, and were happy and hilarious.

<p/>At last, there was a rumbling, and a rushing, and a whispering, and
the music stopped; so the dancers were obliged to do so too; and in
came Lord Cumnor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) state dress, with a fat, middle-aged woman
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) arm; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dressed almost like a girl--in a sprigged muslin,
with natural flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair, but not a vestige of a jewel or a
diamond. Yet it must be the duchess; but what was a duchess without
diamonds?--and in a dress which farmer Hudson's daughter might have
worn! Was it the duchess? Could it be the duchess? The little crowd
of inquirers around Mrs. Gibson thickened, to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) confirm their
disappointing surmise. After the duchess came Lady Cumnor, looking
like Lady Macbeth in black velvet--a cloud upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) brow, made more
conspicuous by the lines of age rapidly gathering on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) handsome
face; and Lady Harriet, and other ladies, amongst whom there was one
dressed so like the duchess as to suggest the idea of a sister rather
than a daughter, as far as dress went. There was Lord Hollingford,
plain in face, awkward in person, gentlemanly in manner; and
half-a-dozen younger men, Lord Albert Monson, Captain James, and
others of their age and standing, who came in looking anything if not
critical. This long-expected party swept up to the seats reserved
for them at the head of the room, apparently regardless of the
interruption they caused; for the dancers stood aside, and almost
dispersed back to their seats, and when <div class="bookquote">``Money-musk''  (<font color='red'><b>the dancers</b></font>)</div>struck up again,
not half the former set of people stood up to finish the dance.

<p/>Lady Harriet, who was rather different to Miss Piper, and no more
minded crossing the room alone than if the lookers-on were so many
cabbages, spied the Gibson party pretty quickly out, and came across
to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we are at last. How d'ye do, dear? Why, little one''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>-LRB-to Molly-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``how nice you're looking! Aren't we shamefully late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! it's only just past twelve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson; <div class="bookquote">``and I daresay
you dined very late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't that; it was that ill-mannered woman, who went to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
room after we came out from dinner, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Lady Alice stayed
there invisible, till we thought they were putting on some splendid
attire--as they ought to have done--and at half-past ten, when mamma
sent up to them to say the carriages were at the door, the duchess
sent down for some beef-tea, and at last appeared _à l'enfant_ as
you see her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>). Mamma is so angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), and some of the others are
annoyed at not coming earlier, and one or two are giving themselves
airs about coming at all. Papa is the only one who is not affected by
it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>Then turning to Molly Lady Harriet asked,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been dancing much, Miss Gibson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly Lady Harriet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; not every dance, but nearly all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a simple question enough; but Lady Harriet's speaking at all
to Molly had become to Mrs. Gibson almost like shaking a red rag at
a bull; it was the one thing sure to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) out of temper. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
would not have shown this to Lady Harriet for the world; only she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
contrived to baffle any endeavours at further conversation between
the two, by placing herself betwixt Lady Harriet and Molly, whom the
former asked to sit down in the absent Cynthia's room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't go back to those people, I am so mad with them; and,
besides, I hardly saw you the other day, and I must have some gossip
with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sat down by Mrs. Gibson, and as Mrs. Goodenough
afterwards expressed it, <div class="bookquote">``looked like anybody else.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Goodenough
said this to excuse herself for a little misadventure she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) fell into.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) had taken a deliberate survey of the grandees at the upper end of
the room, spectacles on nose, and had inquired, in no very measured
voice, who everybody was, from Mr. Sheepshanks, my lord's agent, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) very good neighbour, who in vain tried to check her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) loud ardour
for information by replying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) in whispers. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) was rather
deaf as well as blind, so his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) low tones only brought upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) fresh
inquiries. Now, satisfied as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) could be, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) way
to departure, and the extinguishing of fire and candle-light, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>)
stopped opposite to Mrs. Gibson, and thus addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) by way of
renewal of their former subject of conversation:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a shabby thing for a duchess I never saw; not a bit of a
diamond near her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)! They're none of 'em worth looking at except the
countess, and she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)'s always a personable woman, and not so lusty
as she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was. But they're not worth waiting up for till this time o'
night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a moment's pause. Then Lady Harriet put her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand out, and
said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't remember me, but I know you from having seen you at the
Towers. Lady Cumnor is a good deal thinner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was, but we hope
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) health is better for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Lady Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson to Mrs. Goodenough, in
reproachful dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Deary me, your ladyship! I hope I've given no offence! But, you
see--that is to say, your ladyship sees, that it's late hours for
such folks as me, and I only stayed out of my bed to see the duchess,
and I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)'d come in diamonds and a coronet; and it puts one
out at my age, to be disappointed in the only chance I'm like to have
of so fine a sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm put out too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to have come early,
and here we are as late as this. I'm so cross and ill-tempered, I
should be glad to hide myself in bed as soon as you will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) said this so sweetly that Mrs. Goodenough relaxed into a smile,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) crabbedness into a compliment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe as ever your ladyship can be cross and ill-tempered
with that pretty face. I'm an old woman, so you must let me say so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>Lady Harriet stood up, and made a low curtsey. Then holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't keep you up any longer; but I'll promise one thing in return
for your pretty speech: if ever I am a duchess, I'll come and show
myself to you in all my robes and gewgaws. Good night, madam!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There! I knew how it would be!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), not resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) seat.
<div class="bookquote">``And on the eve of a county election too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you must not take old Mrs. Goodenough as a specimen, dear Lady
Harriet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is always a grumbler! I am sure no one else would
complain of your all being as late as you liked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, suddenly turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
eyes on Molly's face. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think we've lost some of our
popularity,--which at this time means votes--by coming so late. Come,
answer me! you used to be a famous little truth-teller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about popularity or votes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, rather
unwillingly. <div class="bookquote">``But I think many people were sorry you did not come
sooner; and isn't that rather a proof of popularity?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a very neat and diplomatic answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet,
smiling, and tapping Molly's cheek with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly knows nothing about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, a little off
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) guard. <div class="bookquote">``It would be very impertinent if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) or any one else
questioned Lady Cumnor's perfect right to come when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) chose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, all I know is, I must go back to mamma now; but I shall make
another raid into these regions by-and-by, and you must keep a place
for me. Ah! there are--Miss Brownings; you see I don't forget my
lesson, Miss Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, I cannot have you speaking so to Lady Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gibson, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was left alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stepdaughter. <div class="bookquote">``You
would never have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at all if it had not been for me, and
don't be always putting yourself into our conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must speak if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) asks me questions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>pleaded Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! if you must, you must, I acknowledge. I'm candid about that at
any rate. But there's no need for you to set up to have an opinion at
your age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how to help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)'s such a whimsical person; look there, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)'s not talking to
Miss Phoebe; and Miss Phoebe is so weak she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>)'ll be easily led away
into fancying she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) is hand and glove with Lady Harriet. If there is
one thing I hate more than another, it is the trying to make out an
intimacy with great people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly felt innocent enough, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) offered no justification of
herself, and made no reply. Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was more occupied in watching
Cynthia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not understand the change that seemed to have come
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was dancing, it was true, with the same lightness and
grace as before, but the smooth bounding motion, as of a feather
blown onwards by the wind, was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was conversing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
partner, but without the soft animation that usually shone out upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) countenance. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was brought back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) seat Molly
noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) changed colour, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dreamily abstracted eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, Cynthia?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), in a very low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, suddenly looking up, and in an accent of
what, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), was sharpness. <div class="bookquote">``Why should there be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; but you look different to what you did--tired or
something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing the matter, or, if there is, don't talk about it.
It's all your fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a rather contradictory speech, to be interpreted by
intuition rather than by logic. Molly understood that Cynthia wished
for quietness and silence. But what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) surprise, after the
speeches that had passed before, and the implication of Cynthia's
whole manner to Mr. Preston, to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) come up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), and, without
a word, offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) arm and lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) away to dance. It appeared to
strike Mrs. Gibson as something remarkable; for, forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) late
passage at arms with Molly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) asked, wonderingly, as if almost
distrusting the evidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) senses,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Cynthia going to dance with Mr. Preston?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had scarcely time to answer before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) herself was led off by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) partner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could hardly attend to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) or to the figures of the
quadrille for watching for Cynthia among the moving forms.

<p/>Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) caught a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) standing still--downcast--listening
to Mr. Preston's eager speech. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was walking languidly among
the dancers, almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) took no notice of those around her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) and Molly joined each other again, the shade on Cynthia's
face had deepened to gloom. But, at the same time, if a physiognomist
had studied her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) expression, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) would have read in it defiance and
anger, and perhaps also a little perplexity. While this quadrille had
been going on, Lady Harriet had been speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hollingford!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) said, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arm, and drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
a little apart from the well-born crowd amid which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stood, silent
and abstracted, <div class="bookquote">``you don't know how these good people here have been
hurt and disappointed with our being so late, and with the duchess's
ridiculous simplicity of dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should they mind it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), taking advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being
out of breath with eagerness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't be so wise and stupid; don't you see, we're a show and a
spectacle--it's like having a pantomime with harlequin and columbine
in plain clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand how--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then take it upon trust. They really are a little disappointed,
whether they are logical or not in being so, and we must try and make
it up to them; for one thing, because I can't bear our vassals to
look dissatisfied and disloyal, and then there's the election in
June.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really would as soon be out of the House as in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense; it would grieve papa beyond measure--but there's no
time to talk about that now. You must go and dance with some of
the townspeople, and I'll ask Sheepshanks to introduce me to a
respectable young farmer. Can't you get Captain James to make himself
useful? There he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) goes with Lady Alice! If I don't get him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) introduced
to the ugliest tailor's daughter I can find for the next dance!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) arm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brother's as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spoke, as if to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to some
partner. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) resisted, however--resisted piteously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't, Harriet. You know I can't dance. I hate it; I always
did. I don't know how to get through a quadrille.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a country dance!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), resolutely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all the same. And what shall I say to my partner? I haven't
a notion: I shall have no subject in common. Speak of being
disappointed, they'll be ten times more disappointed when they find I
can neither dance nor talk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be merciful; don't be so cowardly. In their eyes a lord may
dance like a bear--as some lords not very far from me are--if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
likes, and they'll take it for grace. And you shall begin with Molly
Gibson, your friend the doctor's daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s a good, simple,
intelligent little girl, which you'll think a great deal more of, I
suppose, than of the frivolous fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) being very pretty. Clare!
will you allow me to introduce my brother to Miss Gibson? he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hopes to
engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) for this dance. Lord Hollingford, Miss Gibson!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Hollingford/Hollingford</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Lord Hollingford! there was nothing for it but for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) to follow
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) sister's very explicit lead, and Molly and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) walked off to their
places, each heartily wishing their dance together well over. Lady
Harriet flew off to Mr. Sheepshanks to secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) respectable young
farmer, and Mrs. Gibson remained alone, wishing that Lady Cumnor
would send one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) attendant gentlemen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>). It would be so
much more agreeable to be sitting even at the fag-end of nobility
than here on a bench with everybody; hoping that everybody would see
Molly dancing away with a lord, yet vexed that the chance had so
befallen that Molly instead of Cynthia was the young lady singled
out; wondering if simplicity of dress was now become the highest
fashion, and pondering on the possibility of cleverly inducing
Lady Harriet to introduce Lord Albert Monson to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own beautiful
daughter, Cynthia.

<p/>Molly found Lord Hollingford, the wise and learned Lord Hollingford,
strangely stupid in understanding the mystery of <div class="bookquote">``Cross hands and
back again, down the middle and up again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Hollingford/Hollingford</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) was constantly getting
hold of the wrong hands, and as constantly stopping when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had
returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) place, quite unaware that the duties of society and
the laws of the dance required that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) should go on capering till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had arrived at the bottom of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had
performed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) part very badly, and apologized to Molly when once they
had arrived at that haven of comparative peace; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>)
regret so simply and heartily that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ease with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) at
once, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) reluctance at having to
dance at all, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) only doing it under his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) sister's compulsion.
To Molly he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) was an elderly widower, almost as old as her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father,
and by-and-by they got into very pleasant conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) learnt
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) that Roger Hamley had just been publishing a paper in some
scientific periodical, which had excited considerable attention,
as it was intended to confute some theory of a great French
physiologist, and Roger's article proved the writer to be possessed
of a most unusual amount of knowledge on the subject. This piece
of news was of great interest to Molly; and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) questions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
herself evinced so much intelligence, and a mind so well prepared for
the reception of information, that Lord Hollingford at any rate would
have felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) quest of popularity a very easy affair indeed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
might have gone on talking quietly to Molly during the rest of the
evening. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) found Mr. Gibson
there, and fell into talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), until Lady Harriet once more came
to stir him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) duties. Before very long, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) returned
to Mr. Gibson's side, and began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) of this paper of Roger
Hamley's, of which Mr. Gibson had not yet heard. In the midst
of their conversation, as they stood close by Mrs. Gibson, Lord
Hollingford saw Molly in the distance, and interrupted himself to
say, <div class="bookquote">``What a charming little lady that daughter of yours is! Most
girls of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) age are so difficult to talk to; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is intelligent
and full of interest in all sorts of sensible things; well read,
too--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was up in _Le Règne Animal_--and very pretty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson bowed, much pleased at such a compliment from such a man,
were he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lord or not. It is very likely that if Molly had been a
stupid listener, Lord Hollingford would not have discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
beauty; or the converse might be asserted--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had not been young
and pretty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) would not have exerted himself to talk on scientific
subjects in a manner which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could understand. But in whatever way
Molly had won his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) approbation and admiration, there was no doubt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had earned it somehow. And, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) next returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) place,
Mrs. Gibson greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with soft words and a gracious smile; for
it does not require much reasoning power to discover, that if it
is a very fine thing to be mother-in-law to a very magnificent
three-tailed bashaw, it presupposes that the wife who makes the
connection between the two parties is in harmony with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother. And
so far had Mrs. Gibson's thoughts wandered into futurity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) only
wished that the happy chance had fallen to Cynthia's instead of to
Molly's lot. But Molly was a docile, sweet creature, very pretty,
and remarkably intelligent, as my lord had said. It was a pity that
Cynthia preferred making millinery to reading; but perhaps that could
be rectified. And there was Lord Cumnor coming to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), and
Lady Cumnor nodding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), and indicating a place by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) side.

<p/>It was not an unsatisfactory ball upon the whole to Mrs. Gibson,
although she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) paid the usual penalty for sitting up beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
ordinary hour in perpetual glare and movement. The next morning
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) awoke irritable and fatigued; and a little of the same feeling
oppressed both Cynthia and Molly. The former was lounging in the
window-seat, holding a three-days'-old newspaper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was making a pretence of reading, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was startled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
mother's saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia! can't you take up a book and improve yourself? I am sure
your conversation will never be worth listening to, unless you read
something better than newspapers. Why don't you keep up your French?
There was some French book that Molly was reading--_Le Règne Animal_,
I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I never read it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, blushing. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Roger Hamley
sometimes read pieces out of it when I was first at the Hall, and
told me what it was about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! well. Then I suppose I was mistaken. But it comes to all the
same thing. Cynthia, you really must learn to settle yourself to some
improving reading every morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Rather to Molly's surprise, Cynthia did not reply a word; but
dutifully went and brought down from among her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) Boulogne school-books,
_Le Siècle de Louis XIV_. But after a while, Molly saw that this
<div class="bookquote">``improving reading''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>was just as much a mere excuse for Cynthia's
thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own thoughts as the newspaper had been.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVII.

<p/>FATHER AND SONS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>Things were not going on any better at Hamley Hall. Nothing had
occurred to change the state of dissatisfied feeling into which the
Squire and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eldest son had respectively fallen; and the long
continuance merely of dissatisfaction is sure of itself to deepen
the feeling. Roger did all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) power to bring the father and son
together; but sometimes wondered if it would not have been better to
leave them alone; for they were falling into the habit of each making
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) their confidant, and so defining emotions and opinions which
would have had less distinctness if they had been unexpressed. There
was little enough relief in the daily life at the Hall to help them
all to shake off the gloom; and it even told on the health of both
the Squire and Osborne. The Squire became thinner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) skin as well
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) clothes began to hang loose about him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and the freshness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) colour turned to red streaks, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) cheeks looked like
Eardiston pippins, instead of resembling <div class="bookquote">``a Katherine pear on the
side that's next the sun.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Roger thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father sate indoors
and smoked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) study more than was good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), but it had
become difficult to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) far afield; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was too much afraid of
coming across some sign of the discontinued drainage works, or being
irritated afresh by the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) depreciated timber. Osborne was
wrapt up in the idea of arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) poems for the press, and so
working out his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wish for independence. What with daily writing to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife--taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) letters himself to a distant post-office, and
receiving hers there--touching up his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sonnets, &c., with fastidious
care--and occasionally giving himself the pleasure of a visit to the
Gibsons, and enjoying the society of the two pleasant girls there,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) found little time for being with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father. Indeed, Osborne was
too self-indulgent or <div class="bookquote">``sensitive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) termed it, to bear well
with the Squire's gloomy fits, or too frequent querulousness. The
consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) secret, too, made Osborne uncomfortable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
father's presence. It was very well for all parties that Roger was
not <div class="bookquote">``sensitive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>for, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been, there were times when it would
have been hard to bear little spurts of domestic tyranny, by which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father strove to assert his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) power over both his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sons. One of
these occurred very soon after the night of the Hollingford
charity-ball.

<p/>Roger had induced his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father to come out with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and the Squire
had, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son's suggestion, taken with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) long unused spud.
The two had wandered far afield; perhaps the elder man had found the
unwonted length of exercise too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approached
the house, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became what nurses call in children
<div class="bookquote">``fractious,''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>and ready to turn on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion for every remark he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
made. Roger understood the case by instinct, as it were, and bore it
all with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) usual sweetness of temper. They entered the house by
the front door; it lay straight on their line of march. On the old
cracked yellow-marble slab, there lay a card with Lord Hollingford's
name on it, which Robinson, evidently on the watch for their return,
hastened out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) pantry to deliver to Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) lordship was very sorry not to see you, Mr. Roger, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
lordship left a note for you. Mr. Osborne took it, I think, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) passed through. I asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) lordship if he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) would like to see Mr.
Osborne, who was indoors, as I thought. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) lordship said he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was
pressed for time, and told me to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) excuses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) ask for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>growled the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I can't say as his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) lordship did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) would never have
thought of Mr. Osborne, sir, if I hadn't named him (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>). It was Mr. Roger
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) seemed so keen after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire. Roger said nothing, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
naturally felt some curiosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went into the drawing-room, not
quite aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father was following him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). Osborne sate at a
table near the fire, pen in hand, looking over one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) poems, and
dotting the _i_'s, crossing the _t_'s, and now and then pausing over
the alteration of a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Roger!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother came in, <div class="bookquote">``here's been Lord
Hollingford wanting to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>replied Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>)'s left a note for you. Robinson tried to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) it was
for my father, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>)'s added a `junior' -LRB-Roger Hamley, Esq., junior-RRB-
in pencil.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div>The Squire was in the room by this time, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
overheard rubbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) up still more the wrong way. Roger took his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
unopened note and read it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>asked the Squire.

<p/>Roger handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the note. It contained an invitation to dinner to
meet M. Geoffroi St. H--, whose views on certain subjects Roger had
been advocating in the article Lord Hollingford had spoken about to
Molly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at the Hollingford ball. M. Geoffroi
St. H-- was in England now, and was expected to pay a visit at
the Towers in the course of the following week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had expressed a
wish to meet the author of the paper which had already attracted the
attention of the French comparative anatomists; and Lord Hollingford
added a few words as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) own desire to make the acquaintance of a
neighbour whose tastes were so similar to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) own; and then followed
a civil message from Lord and Lady Cumnor.

<p/>Lord Hollingford's hand was cramped and rather illegible. The squire
could not read it all at once, and was enough put out to decline any
assistance in deciphering it. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) made it out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So my lord lieutenant is taking some notice of the Hamleys at last.
The election is coming on, is it? But I can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) we're not to be
got so easily. I suppose this trap is set for you, Osborne? What's
this you've been writing that the French mounseer is so taken with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not me, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``Both note and call are for
Roger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``These Whig fellows have
never done their duty by me; not that I want it of them. The Duke
of Debenham used to pay the Hamleys a respect due to 'em--the
oldest landowners in the county--but since he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) died, and this
shabby Whig lord has succeeded him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), I've never dined at the lord
lieutenant's--no, not once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I think, sir, I've heard you say Lord Cumnor used to invite
you,--only you did not choose to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. What d'ye mean by that? Do you suppose I was going to desert
the principles of my family, and curry favour with the Whigs? No!
leave that to them. They can ask the heir of the Hamleys fast enough
when a county election is coming on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, in the irritable tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sometimes
used when his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father was particularly unreasonable, <div class="bookquote">``it is not me
Lord Hollingford is inviting; it is Roger. Roger is making himself
known for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is, a first-rate fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>continued Osborne--a
sting of self-reproach mingling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) generous pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
brother--<div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s getting himself a name; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s been writing
about these new French theories and discoveries, and this foreign
_savant_ very naturally wants to make his (<font color='blue'><b>savant</b></font>) acquaintance, and so Lord
Hollingford asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) to dine. It's as clear as can be,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
tone, and addressing himself to Roger; <div class="bookquote">``it has nothing to do with
politics, if my father would but see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course the Squire heard this little aside with the unlucky
uncertainty of hearing which is a characteristic of the beginning
of deafness; and its effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was perceptible in the increased
acrimony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) next speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You young men think you know everything. I tell you it's a palpable
Whig trick. And what business has Roger--if it is Roger the man
wants--to go currying favour with the French? In my day we were
content to hate 'em and to lick 'em. But it's just like your conceit,
Osborne, setting yourself up to say it's your younger brother they're
asking, and not you; I tell you it's you. They think the eldest son
was sure to be called after his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, Roger--Roger Hamley, junior.
It's as plain as a pike-staff. They know they can't catch me with
chaff, but they've got up this French dodge. What business had you to
go writing about the French, Roger? I should have thought you were
too sensible to take any notice of their fancies and theories; but if
it is you they've asked, I'll not have you going and meeting these
foreigners at a Whig house. They ought to have asked Osborne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s
the representative of the Hamleys, if I'm not; and they can't get me,
let 'em try ever so. Besides, Osborne has got a bit of the mounseer
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) caught with being so fond of going off to the
Continent, instead of coming back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) good old English home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) went on repeating much of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had said before, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
left the room. Osborne had kept on replying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) unreasonable
grumblings, which had only added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) anger; and as soon as the
Squire was fairly gone, Osborne turned to Roger, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you'll go, Roger? ten to one he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll be in another mind
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, bluntly enough--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was extremely disappointed;
<div class="bookquote">``I won't run the chance of vexing him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). I shall refuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be such a fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``Really, my father is too
unreasonable. You heard how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kept contradicting himself; and such a
man as you to be kept under like a child by--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us talk any more about it, Osborne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, writing
away fast. When the note was written, and sent off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came and put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hand caressingly on Osborne's shoulder, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sate pretending
to read, but in reality vexed with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother,
though on very different grounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How go the poems, old fellow? I hope they're nearly ready to bring
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they're not; and if it weren't for the money, I shouldn't care
if they were never published. What's the use of fame, if one mayn't
reap the fruits of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, now, we'll have no more of that; let's talk about the money.
I shall be going up for my Fellowship examination next week, and then
we'll have a purse in common, for they'll never think of not giving
me a Fellowship now I'm senior wrangler. I'm short enough myself at
present, and I don't like to bother my father; but when I'm Fellow,
you shall take me down to Winchester, and introduce me to the little
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a month next Monday since I left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne,
laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) papers and gazing into the fire, as if by so doing he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
could call up her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) image. <div class="bookquote">``In her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) letter this morning she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bids me give
you such a pretty message. It won't bear translating into English;
you must read it for yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), pointing out a line or
two in a letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pocket.

<p/>Roger suspected that one or two of the words were wrongly spelt;
but their purport was so gentle and loving, and had such a touch of
simple, respectful gratitude in them, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not help being
drawn afresh to the little unseen sister-in-law, whose acquaintance
Osborne had made by helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) to look for some missing article of
the children's, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was taking for their daily walk in Hyde
Park. For Mrs. Osborne Hamley had been nothing more than a French
_bonne_, very pretty, very graceful, and very much tyrannized over
by the rough little boys and girls she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had in charge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was a
little orphan girl, who had charmed the heads of a travelling English
family, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had brought madame some articles of lingerie at an
hotel; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had been hastily engaged by them as _bonne_ to their
children, partly as a pet and plaything herself, partly because it
would be so good for the children to learn French from a native
-LRB-of Alsace!-RRB-. By-and-by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mistress ceased to take any particular
notice of Aimée in the bustle of London and London gaiety; but though
feeling more and more forlorn in a strange land every day, the French
girl strove hard to do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) duty. One touch of kindness, however, was
enough to set the fountain gushing; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and Osborne naturally
fell into an ideal state of love, to be rudely disturbed by the
indignation of the mother, when accident discovered to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the
attachment existing between her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children's _bonne_ and a young man
of an entirely different class. Aimée answered truly to all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
mistress's questions; but no worldly wisdom, nor any lesson to be
learnt from another's experience, could in the least disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
entire faith in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lover. Perhaps Mrs. Townshend did no more than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Townshend</b></font>) duty in immediately sending Aimée back to Metz, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Townshend</b></font>) had
first met with her (<font color='blue'><b>Townshend</b></font>), and where such relations as remained to the girl
might be supposed to be residing. But, altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew so little
of the kind of people or life to which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was consigning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) deposed
protégée that Osborne, after listening with impatient indignation to
the lecture which Mrs. Townshend gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Metz</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Metz</b></font>) insisted on seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Townshend</b></font>) in order to learn what had become of his (<font color='blue'><b>Metz</b></font>) love, that the young man
set off straight for Metz in hot haste, and did not let the grass
grow under his (<font color='blue'><b>Metz</b></font>) feet until he (<font color='blue'><b>Metz</b></font>) had made Aimée his (<font color='blue'><b>Metz</b></font>) wife. All this had
occurred the previous autumn, and Roger did not know of the step his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
brother had taken until it was irrevocable. Then came the mother's
death, which, besides the simplicity of its own overwhelming sorrow,
brought with it the loss of the kind, tender mediatrix, who could
always soften and turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father's heart. It is doubtful, however,
if even she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could have succeeded in this, for the Squire looked high,
and over high, for the wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heir; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) detested all foreigners,
and overmore held all Roman Catholics in dread and abomination
something akin to our ancestors' hatred of witchcraft. All these
prejudices were strengthened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grief. Argument would always have
glanced harmless away off his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) shield of utter unreason; but a loving
impulse, in a happy moment, might have softened his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heart to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
most detested in the former days. But the happy moments came not now,
and the loving impulses were trodden down by the bitterness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
frequent remorse, not less than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) growing irritability; so Aimée
lived solitary in the little cottage near Winchester in which Osborne
had installed her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) first came to England as his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife, and
in the dainty furnishing of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had run himself so deeply into
debt. For Osborne consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own fastidious taste in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) purchases
rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) simple childlike wishes and wants, and looked upon
the little Frenchwoman rather as the future mistress of Hamley Hall
than as the wife of a man who was wholly dependent on others at
present. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had chosen a southern county as being far removed from
those midland shires where the name of Hamley of Hamley was well and
widely known; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not wish his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife to assume, if only for a
time, a name which was not justly and legally her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own. In all these
arrangements he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had willingly striven to do his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) full duty by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) repaid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with passionate devotion and admiring reverence. If
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vanity had met with a check, or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worthy desires for college
honours had been disappointed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew where to go for a comforter;
one who poured out praise till her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) words were choked in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) throat by
the rapidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thoughts, and who poured out the small vials of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) indignation on every one who did not acknowledge and bow down to
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's merits. If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ever wished to go to the château--that
was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) home--and to be introduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) family, Aimée never hinted
a word of it to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Only she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did yearn, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did plead, for a
little more of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's company; and the good reasons which had
convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of the necessity of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) being so much away when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
present to urge them, failed in their efficacy when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried to
reproduce them to herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) absence.

<p/>The afternoon of the day on which Lord Hollingford called Roger
was going upstairs, three steps at a time, when, at a turn on the
landing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) encountered his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father. It was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) since their conversation about the Towers' invitation to dinner.
The Squire stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son by standing right in the middle of the
passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou`rt going to meet the mounseer, my lad?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), half as
affirmation, half as question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I sent off James almost immediately with a note declining
it. I don't care about it--that's to say, not to signify.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you take me up so sharp, Roger?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father pettishly.
<div class="bookquote">``You all take me up so hastily now-a-days. I think it's hard when a
man mustn't be allowed a bit of crossness when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s tired and heavy
at heart--that I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, father, I should never like to go to a house where they had
slighted you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, brightening up a little; <div class="bookquote">``I think
I slighted them. They asked me to dinner, after my lord was made
lieutenant, time after time, but I never would go near 'em. I call
that my slighting them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>And no more was said at the time; but the next day the Squire again
stopped Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been making Jem try on his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) livery-coat that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hasn't worn this
three or four years,--he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'s got too stout for it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) needn't wear it, need he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)? and Morgan's lad will be glad
enough of it,--he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s sadly in want of clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay; but who's to go with you when you call at the Towers? It's
but polite to call after Lord What's-his-name has taken the trouble
to come here; and I shouldn't like you to go without a groom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear father! I shouldn't know what to do with a man riding at my
back. I can find my way to the stable-yard for myself, or there'll be
some man about to take my horse. Don't trouble yourself about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you're not Osborne, to be sure. Perhaps it won't strike 'em
as strange for you. But you must look up, and hold your own, and
remember you're one of the Hamleys, who've been on the same land for
hundreds of years, while they're but trumpery Whig folk who only came
into the county in Queen Anne's time.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVIII.

<p/>RIVALRY.


<p/>For some days after the ball Cynthia seemed languid, and was very
silent. Molly, who had promised herself fully as much enjoyment in
talking over the past gaiety with Cynthia as in the evening itself,
was disappointed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) found that all conversation on the subject
was rather evaded than encouraged. Mrs. Gibson, it is true, was ready
to go over the ground as many times as any one liked; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) words
were always like ready-made clothes, and never fitted individual
thoughts. Anybody might have used them, and, with a change of proper
names, they might have served to describe any ball. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) repeatedly
used the same language in speaking about it, till Molly knew the
sentences and their sequence even to irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Mr. Osborne, you should have been there! I said to myself many a
time how you really should have been there--you and your brother, of
course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought of you very often during the evening!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you? Now that I call very kind of you. Cynthia, darling! Do you
hear what Mr. Osborne Hamley was saying?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>as Cynthia came into the
room just then. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thought of us all on the evening of the ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) did better than merely remember us then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
soft slow smile. <div class="bookquote">``We owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thanks for those beautiful flowers,
mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, <div class="bookquote">``you must not thank me exclusively. I believe it
was my thought, but Roger took all the trouble of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I consider the thought as everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``Thought is
spiritual, while action is merely material.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>This fine sentence took the speaker herself by surprise; and in such
conversation as was then going on, it is not necessary to accurately
define the meaning of everything that is said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid the flowers were too late to be of much use, though,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>continued Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``I met Preston the next morning, and of course we
talked about the ball. I was sorry to find he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had been beforehand
with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) only sent one nosegay, and that was for Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly,
looking up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``And it did not come till after we had
received the flowers from Hamley.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly caught a sight of Cynthia's
face before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) bent down again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sewing. It was scarlet in
colour, and there was a flash of anger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes. Both she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
mother hastened to speak as soon as Molly had finished, but Cynthia's
voice was choked with passion, and Mrs. Gibson had the word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Preston's bouquet was just one of those formal affairs any one
can buy at a nursery-garden, which always strike me as having no
sentiment in them. I would far rather have two or three lilies of the
valley gathered for me by a person I like, than the most expensive
bouquet that could be bought!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Preston had no business to speak as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had forestalled you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``It came just as we were ready to go, and I put it into
the fire directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia, my dear love!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson -LRB-who had never heard of the
fate of the flowers until now-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``what an idea of yourself you will
give to Mr. Osborne Hamley; but, to be sure, I can quite understand
it. You inherit my feeling--my prejudice--sentimental I grant,
against bought flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia was silent for a moment; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I used some of
your flowers, Mr. Hamley, to dress Molly's hair. It was a great
temptation, for the colour so exactly matched her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) coral ornaments;
but I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought it treacherous to disturb the arrangement,
so I ought to take all the blame on myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The arrangement was my brother's, as I told you; but I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would have preferred seeing them in Miss Gibson's hair rather than
in the blazing fire. Mr. Preston comes far the worst off.''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>Osborne
was rather amused at the whole affair, and would have liked to probe
Cynthia's motives a little farther. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not hear Molly saying in
as soft a voice as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were talking to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I wore mine just
as they were sent,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for Mrs. Gibson came in with a total change of
subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speaking of lilies of the valley, is it true that they grow wild
in Hurst Wood? It is not the season for them to be in flower yet;
but when it is, I think we must take a walk there--with our luncheon
in a basket--a little picnic in fact. You'll join us, won't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>turning to Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``I think it's a charming plan! You could ride to
Hollingford and put up your horse here, and we could have a long day
in the woods and all come home to dinner--dinner with a basket of
lilies in the middle of the table!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne; <div class="bookquote">``but I may not be at
home. Roger is more likely to be here, I believe, at that time--a
month hence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was thinking of the visit to London to sell
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) poems, and the run down to Winchester which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) anticipated
afterwards--the end of May had been the period fixed for this
pleasure for some time, not merely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own mind, but in writing to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but you must be with us! We must wait for Mr. Osborne Hamley,
must not we, Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid the lilies won't wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>replied Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, we must put it off till dog-rose and honey-suckle time.
You will be at home then, won't you? or does the London season
present too many attractions?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't exactly know when dog-roses are in flower!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not know, and you a poet? Don't you remember the lines--

<p/>It was the time of roses,
We plucked them as we passed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but that doesn't specify the time of year that is the time
of roses; and I believe my movements are guided more by the lunar
calendar than the floral. You had better take my brother for your
companion; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) is practical in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) love of flowers, I am only
theoretical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does that fine word `theoretical' imply that you are ignorant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we shall be happy to see your brother; but why can't we
have you too? I confess to a little timidity in the presence of one
so deep and learned as your brother is from all accounts. Give me a
little charming ignorance, if we must call it by that hard word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne bowed. It was very pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to be petted and
flattered, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) knew all the time that it was only
flattery. It was an agreeable contrast to the home that was so dismal
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), to come to this house, where the society of two agreeable
girls, and the soothing syrup of their mother's speeches, awaited
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) liked to come. To say nothing of the difference that
struck upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) senses, poetical though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) might esteem himself, of a
sitting-room full of flowers, and tokens of women's presence, where
all the chairs were easy, and all the tables well covered with pretty
things, to the great drawing-room at home, where the draperies were
threadbare, and the seats uncomfortable, and no sign of feminine
presence ever now lent a grace to the stiff arrangement of the
furniture. Then the meals, light and well-cooked, suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) taste
and delicate appetite so much better than the rich and heavy viands
prepared by the servants at the Hall. Osborne was becoming a little
afraid of falling into the habit of paying too frequent visits to
the Gibsons -LRB-and that, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) feared the consequences of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) intercourse with the two young ladies; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) never thought of
them excepting as friends;--the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) marriage was constantly
present to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mind, and Aimée too securely enthroned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) heart,
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) might be looked upon by others in the
light of a possible husband-RRB-; but the reflection forced itself
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) occasionally, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was not trespassing too often on
hospitality which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had at present no means of returning.

<p/>But Mrs. Gibson, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ignorance of the true state of affairs, was
secretly exultant in the attraction which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) come so often
and lounge away the hours in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) house and garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had no doubt
that it was Cynthia who drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thither; and if the latter had been
a little more amenable to reason, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother would have made more
frequent allusions than she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did to the crisis which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thought was
approaching. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was restrained by the intuitive conviction that
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) daughter became conscious of what was impending, and was made
aware of Mrs. Gibson's cautious and quiet efforts to forward the
catastrophe, the wilful girl would oppose herself to it with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) skill and power. As it was, Mrs. Gibson trusted that Cynthia's
affections would become engaged before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was, and
that in that case she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would not attempt to frustrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mother's
delicate scheming, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did perceive it. But Cynthia had
come across too many varieties of flirtation, admiration, and even
passionate love, to be for a moment at fault as to the quiet friendly
nature of Osborne's attentions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) always as a sister
might a brother. It was different when Roger returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
election as Fellow of Trinity. The trembling diffidence, the hardly
suppressed ardour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) manner, made Cynthia understand before long
with what kind of love she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had now to deal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not put it into
so many words--no, not even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) secret heart--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) recognized
the difference between Roger's relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) and Osborne's long
before Mrs. Gibson found it out. Molly was, however, the first to
discover the nature of Roger's attention. The first time they saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) after the ball, it came out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) observant eyes. Cynthia had
not been looking well since that evening; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went slowly about the
house, pale and heavy-eyed; and, fond as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) usually was of exercise
and the free fresh air, there was hardly any persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) now to go
out for a walk. Molly watched this fading with tender anxiety, but
to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) questions as to whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had felt over-fatigued with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dancing, whether anything had occurred to annoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and all
such inquiries, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) replied in languid negatives. Once Molly touched
on Mr. Preston's name, and found that this was a subject on which
Cynthia was raw; now, Cynthia's face lighted up with spirit, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
whole body showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ill-repressed agitation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) only said a
few sharp words, expressive of anything but kindly feeling towards
the gentleman, and then bade Molly never name his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) again.
Still, the latter could not imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was more than intensely
distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) friend, as well as to herself; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not be
the cause of Cynthia's present indisposition. But this indisposition
lasted so many days without change or modification, that even Mrs.
Gibson noticed it, and Molly became positively uneasy. Mrs. Gibson
considered Cynthia's quietness and languor as the natural consequence
of <div class="bookquote">``dancing with everybody who asked her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>at the ball. Partners whose
names were in the <div class="bookquote">``Red Book''  (<font color='red'><b>Partners</b></font>)</div>would not have produced half the amount
of fatigue, according to Mrs. Gibson's judgment apparently, and if
Cynthia had been quite well, very probably she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would have hit the
blot in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother's speech with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) touches of sarcasm.
Then, again, when Cynthia did not rally, Mrs. Gibson grew impatient,
and accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of being fanciful and lazy; at length, and partly
at Molly's instance, there came an appeal to Mr. Gibson, and a
professional examination of the supposed invalid, which Cynthia hated
more than anything, especially when the verdict was, that there was
nothing very much the matter, only a general lowness of tone, and
depression of health and spirits, which would soon be remedied by
tonics, and meanwhile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was not to be roused to exertion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there is one thing I dislike,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia to Mr. Gibson, after
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had pronounced tonics to be the cure for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) present state, <div class="bookquote">``it is
the way doctors have of giving tablespoonfuls of nauseous mixtures as
a certain remedy for sorrows and cares.''  (<font color='red'><b>tonics</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) laughed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) spoke; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had always a pretty word and smile for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), even in
the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) loss of spirits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come! you acknowledge you have `sorrows' by that speech: we'll make
a bargain: if you'll tell me your sorrows and cares, I'll try and
find some other remedy for them than giving you what you are pleased
to term my nauseous mixtures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, colouring; <div class="bookquote">``I never said I had sorrows and cares;
I spoke generally. What should I have a sorrow about?--you and Molly
are only too kind to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes filling with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, we'll not talk of such gloomy things, and you shall have
some sweet emulsion to disguise the taste of the bitters I shall be
obliged to fall back upon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, don't. If you but knew how I dislike emulsions and
disguises! I do want bitters--and if I sometimes--if I'm obliged
to--if I'm not truthful myself, I do like truth in others--at least,
sometimes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ended her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sentence with another smile, but it was
rather faint and watery.

<p/>Now the first person out of the house to notice Cynthia's change of
look and manner was Roger Hamley--and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) until,
under the influence of the nauseous mixture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was beginning to
recover. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) eyes were scarcely off her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) during the first five
minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was in the room. All the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was trying to talk
to Mrs. Gibson in reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) civil platitudes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was studying
Cynthia; and at the first convenient pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) came and stood before
Molly, so as to interpose his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) person between her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and the rest of the
room; for some visitors had come in subsequent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) entrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, how ill your sister is looking! What is it? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
advice? You must forgive me, but so often those who live together in
the same house don't observe the first approaches of illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Molly's love for Cynthia was fast and unwavering, but if anything
tried it, it was the habit Roger had fallen into of always calling
Cynthia Molly's sister in speaking to the latter. From any one else
it would have been a matter of indifference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), and hardly to be
noticed; it vexed both ear and heart when Roger used the expression;
and there was a curtness of manner as well as of words in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was over-tired by the ball. Papa has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and says she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
will be all right very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wants change of air?''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, meditatively. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish--I do wish we could have her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at the Hall; you and your mother
too, of course. But I don't see how it would be possible--or else how
charming it would be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly felt as if a visit to the Hall under such circumstances would
be altogether so different an affair to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) former ones, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
could hardly tell if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should like it or not.

<p/>Roger went on,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You got our flowers in time, did you not? Ah! you don't know how
often I thought of you that evening! And you enjoyed it too, didn't
you?--you had plenty of agreeable partners, and all that makes a
first ball delightful? I heard that your sister danced every dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``But, after all, I'm not
sure if I want to go to another just yet; there seems to be so much
trouble connected with a ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are thinking of your sister, and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) not being well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I was not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, rather bluntly. <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of the
dress, and the dressing, and the weariness the next day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) unfeeling if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) liked; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had only
too much feeling just then, for it was bringing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a strange
contraction of heart. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was too inherently good himself to put
any harsh construction on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) speech. Just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went away, while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was ostensibly holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand and wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) good-by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in a voice too low to be generally heard,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything I could do for your sister? We have plenty of
books, as you know, if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cares for reading.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, receiving no
affirmative look or word from Molly in reply to this suggestion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went on,--<div class="bookquote">``Or flowers? she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) likes flowers. Oh! and our forced
strawberries are just ready--I will bring some over to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will like them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/>For some reason or other, unknown to the Gibsons, a longer interval
than usual occurred between Osborne's visits, while Roger came almost
every day, always with some fresh offering by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) openly sought
to relieve Cynthia's indisposition as far as it lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) power.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) manner to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was so gentle and gracious that Mrs. Gibson became
alarmed, lest, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``uncouthness''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was pleased
to term it-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might come to be preferred to Osborne, who was so
strangely neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own interests, in Mrs. Gibson's opinion. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) quiet way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) contrived to pass many slights upon Roger; but the
darts rebounded from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) generous nature that could not have imagined
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) motives, and fastened themselves on Molly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had often been
called naughty and passionate when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was a child; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought
now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began to understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) really had a violent
temper. What seemed neither to hurt Roger nor annoy Cynthia made
Molly's blood boil; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had once discovered Mrs. Gibson's
wish to make Roger's visits shorter and less frequent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
always on the watch for indications of this desire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) read her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
stepmother's heart when the latter made allusions to the Squire's
loneliness, now that Osborne was absent from the Hall, and that Roger
was so often away amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friends during the day,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gibson and I should be so delighted if you could have stopped to
dinner; but, of course, we cannot be so selfish as to ask you to stay
when we remember how your father would be left alone. We were saying
yesterday we wondered how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bore his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) solitude, poor old gentleman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/>Or, as soon as Roger came with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) bunch of early roses, it was
desirable for Cynthia to go and rest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own room, while Molly
had to accompany Mrs. Gibson on some improvised errand or call.
Still Roger, whose object was to give pleasure to Cynthia, and who
had, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) boyhood, been always certain of Mr. Gibson's friendly
regard, was slow to perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not wanted. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not
see Cynthia, that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) loss; at any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heard how she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was,
and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) some little thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would like, and
was willing to risk the chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own gratification by calling
four or five times in the hope of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) once. At last there came
a day when Mrs. Gibson went beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usual negative snubbiness,
and when, in some unwonted fit of crossness, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was a very
placid-tempered person in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was guilty of positive
rudeness.

<p/>Cynthia was very much better. Tonics had ministered to a mind
diseased, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hated to acknowledge it; her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) pretty bloom and
much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) light-heartedness had come back, and there was no cause
remaining for anxiety. Mrs. Gibson was sitting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) embroidery
in the drawing-room, and the two girls were at the window, Cynthia
laughing at Molly's earnest endeavours to imitate the French accent
in which the former had been reading a page of Voltaire. For
the duty, or the farce, of settling to <div class="bookquote">``improving reading''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Hollingford/Hollingford</b></font>)</div>in
the mornings was still kept up, although Lord Hollingford, the
unconscious suggestor of the idea, had gone back to town without
making any of the efforts to see Molly again that Mrs. Gibson had
anticipated on the night of the ball. That Alnaschar vision had
fallen to the ground. It was as yet early morning; a delicious,
fresh, lovely June day, the air redolent with the scents of
flower-growth and bloom; and half the time the girls had been
ostensibly employed in the French reading they had been leaning out
of the open window trying to reach a cluster of climbing roses. They
had secured them at last, and the buds lay on Cynthia's lap, but many
of the petals had fallen off; so, though the perfume lingered about
the window-seat, the full beauty of the flowers had passed away. Mrs.
Gibson had once or twice reproved them for the merry noise they were
making, which hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in the business of counting the stitches
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) pattern; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had set herself a certain quantity to do
that morning before going out, and was of that nature which attaches
infinite importance to fulfilling small resolutions, made about
indifferent trifles without any reason whatever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Roger Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was announced. <div class="bookquote">``So tiresome!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson,
almost in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hearing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) pushed away her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) embroidery frame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) cold, motionless hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), with a half-murmured word
of welcome, still eyeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lost embroidery. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) took no apparent
notice, and passed on to the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How delicious!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No need for any more Hamley roses now
yours are out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, replying to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) before either
Cynthia or Molly could speak, though he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) words to them.
<div class="bookquote">``You have been very kind in bringing us flowers so long; but now our
own are out we need not trouble you any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) with a little surprise clouding his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) honest face; it
was perhaps more at the tone than the words. Mrs. Gibson, however,
had been bold enough to strike the first blow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) determined
to go on as opportunity offered. Molly would perhaps have been more
pained if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had not seen Cynthia's colour rise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
to speak, if need were; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) knew that Roger's defence, if defence
were required, might be safely entrusted to Cynthia's ready wit.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hand for the shattered cluster of roses that lay in
Cynthia's lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``my trouble--if Mrs. Gibson considers it has
been a trouble to me--will be over-paid, if I may have this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old lamps for new,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, smiling as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
wish one could always buy nosegays such as you have brought us, as
cheaply.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget the waste of time that, I think, we must reckon as part
of the payment,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Really, Mr. Hamley, we must learn
to shut our doors on you if you come so often, and at such early
hours! I settle myself to my own employment regularly after breakfast
till lunch-time; and it is my wish to keep Cynthia and Molly to a
course of improving reading and study--so desirable for young people
of their age, if they are ever to become intelligent, companionable
women; but with early visitors it is quite impossible to observe any
regularity of habits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>All this was said in that sweet, false tone which of late had gone
through Molly like the scraping of a slate-pencil on a slate. Roger's
face changed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ruddy colour grew paler for a moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) looked
grave and not pleased. In another moment the wonted frankness of
expression returned. Why should not he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) asked himself, believe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)? It was early to call; it did interrupt regular occupation. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
spoke, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I have been very thoughtless--I'll not come so early
again; but I had some excuse to-day: my brother told me you had made
a plan for going to see Hurst Wood when the roses were out, and they
are earlier than usual this year--I've been round to see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) spoke of
a long day there, going before lunch--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The plan was made with Mr. Osborne Hamley. I could not think of
going without him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) this morning, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) named your wish,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) fears he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) cannot be at home till they are out of
flower. I daresay they are not much to see in reality, but the day is
so lovely I thought that the plan of going to Hurst Wood would be a
charming excuse for being out of doors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. How kind you are! and so good, too, in sacrificing your
natural desire to be with your father as much as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to say my father is so much better than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in the
winter that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spends much of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) time out of doors in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fields. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
has been accustomed to go about alone, and I--we think that as great
a return to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) former habits as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can be induced to make is the
best for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when do you return to Cambridge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>There was some hesitation in Roger's manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) replied,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is uncertain. You probably know that I am a Fellow of Trinity
now. I hardly yet know what my future plans may be; I am thinking of
going up to London soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! London is the true place for a young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson,
with decision, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had reflected a good deal on the question.
<div class="bookquote">``If it were not that we really are so busy this morning, I should
have been tempted to make an exception to our general rule; one more
exception, for your early visits have made us make too many already.
Perhaps, however, we may see you again before you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I shall come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), rising to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) leave, and
still holding the demolished roses in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hand. Then, addressing
himself more especially to Cynthia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``My stay in London will
not exceed a fortnight or so--is there anything I can do for you--or
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>turning a little to Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, very sweetly, and then,
acting on a sudden impulse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) leant out of the window, and gathered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) some half-opened roses. <div class="bookquote">``You deserve these; do throw that poor
shabby bunch away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes brightened, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cheeks glowed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) took the offered buds, but
did not throw away the other bunch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, I may come after lunch is over, and the afternoons and
evenings will be the most delicious time of day a month hence.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
said this to both Molly and Cynthia, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) addressed it
to the latter.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson affected not to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was saying, but held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
limp hand once more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we shall see you when you return; and pray tell your
brother how we are longing to have a visit from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had left the room, Molly's heart was quite full. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face, and read something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) feelings: his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
disappointment at their non-acquiescence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) plan of a day's
pleasure in Hurst Wood, the delayed conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) presence
was not welcome to the wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) old friend, which had come so
slowly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)--perhaps, after all, these things touched Molly more
keenly than they did him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) bright look when Cynthia gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) the
rose-buds indicated a gush of sudden delight more vivid than the pain
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) had shown by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) previous increase of gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think why he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will come at such untimely hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gibson, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) fairly out of the house. <div class="bookquote">``It's
different from Osborne; we are so much more intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
came and made friends with us all the time this stupid brother of
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was muddling his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brains with mathematics at Cambridge. Fellow of
Trinity, indeed! I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Fellow</b></font>) would learn to stay there, and not come
intruding here, and assuming that because I asked Osborne to join in
a picnic it was all the same to me which brother came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In short, mamma, one man may steal a horse, but another must not
look over the hedge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, pouting a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the two brothers have always been treated so exactly alike by
their friends, and there has been such a strong friendship between
them, that it is no wonder Roger thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) may be welcome where
Osborne is allowed to come at all hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>continued Molly, in high
dudgeon. <div class="bookquote">``Roger's `muddled brains,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>indeed! Roger, `stupid!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well, my dears! When I was young it wouldn't have been
thought becoming for girls of your age to fly out because a little
restraint was exercised as to the hours at which they should receive
the young men's calls. And they would have supposed that there might
be good reasons why their parents disapproved of the visits of
certain gentlemen, even while they were proud and pleased to see some
members of the same family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that was what I said, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
mother with an expression of innocent bewilderment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``One
man may--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet, child! All proverbs are vulgar, and I do believe that
is the vulgarest of all. You are really catching Roger Hamley's
coarseness, Cynthia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, roused to anger, <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind your abusing
me, but Mr. Roger Hamley has been very kind to me while I've not
been well: I can't bear to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) disparaged. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s coarse, I've
no objection to be coarse as well, for it seems to me it must mean
kindliness and pleasantness, and the bringing of pretty flowers and
presents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly's tears were brimming over at these words; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could have
kissed Cynthia for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) warm partisanship, but, afraid of betraying
emotion, and <div class="bookquote">``making a scene,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>as Mrs. Gibson called any signs of
warm feeling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) book hastily, and ran upstairs to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) room, and locked the door in order to breathe freely. There were
traces of tears upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) returned into the drawing-room
half-an-hour afterwards, walking straight and demurely up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
former place, where Cynthia still sate and gazed idly out of the
window, pouting and displeased; Mrs. Gibson, meanwhile, counting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
stitches aloud with great distinctness and vigour.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX.

<p/>BUSH-FIGHTING.


<p/>During all the months that had elapsed since Mrs. Hamley's death,
Molly had wondered many a time about the secret she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had so
unwittingly become possessed of that last day in the Hall library. It
seemed so utterly strange and unheard-of a thing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) inexperienced
mind, that a man should be married, and yet not live with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife--that a son should have entered into the holy state of matrimony
without his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's knowledge, and without being recognized as the
husband of some one known or unknown by all those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came
in daily contact, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt occasionally as if that little ten
minutes of revelation must have been a vision in a dream. Roger
had only slightly referred to it once, and Osborne had kept entire
silence on the subject ever since. Not even a look, or a pause,
betrayed any allusion to it; it even seemed to have passed out of
their thoughts. There had been the great sad event of their mother's
death to fill their minds on the next occasion of their meeting
Molly; and since then long pauses of intercourse had taken place; so
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sometimes felt as if both the brothers must have forgotten
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had come to know their important secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) even found
herself often entirely forgetting it, but perhaps the consciousness
of it was present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) unawares, and enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to comprehend the
real nature of Osborne's feelings towards Cynthia. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
never for a moment had supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gentle kind manner towards
Cynthia was anything but the courtesy of a friend. Strange to say, in
these latter days Molly had looked upon Osborne's relation to herself
as pretty much the same as that in which at one time she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had regarded
Roger's; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought of the former as of some one as nearly a
brother both to Cynthia and herself, as any young man could well be,
whom they had not known in childhood, and who was in nowise related
to them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very much improved in manner, and
probably in character, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's death. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was no longer
sarcastic, or fastidious, or vain, or self-confident. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not
know how often all these styles of talk or of behaviour were put on
to conceal shyness or consciousness, and to veil the real self from
strangers.

<p/>Osborne's conversation and ways might very possibly have been just
the same as before, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been thrown amongst new people; but Molly
only saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in their own circle in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on terms of decided
intimacy. Still there was no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was really improved,
though perhaps not to the extent for which Molly gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) credit; and
this exaggeration on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) part arose very naturally from the fact,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), perceiving Roger's warm admiration for Cynthia, withdrew a
little out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother's way; and used to go and talk to Molly in
order not to intrude himself between Roger and Cynthia. Of the two,
perhaps, Osborne preferred Molly; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) needed not to talk if the
mood was not on him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)--they were on those happy terms where silence is
permissible, and where efforts to act against the prevailing mood of
the mind are not required. Sometimes, indeed, when Osborne was in the
humour to be critical and fastidious as of yore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) used to vex Roger
by insisting upon it that Molly was prettier than Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mark my words, Roger. Five years hence the beautiful Cynthia's
red and white will have become just a little coarse, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) figure
will have thickened, while Molly's will only have developed into more
perfect grace. I don't believe the girl has done growing yet; I'm
sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s taller than when I first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) last summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Kirkpatrick's eyes must always be perfection. I cannot fancy
any could come up to them: soft, grave, appealing, tender; and such a
heavenly colour--I often try to find something in nature to compare
them to; they are not like violets--that blue in the eyes is too like
physical weakness of sight; they are not like the sky--that colour
has something of cruelty in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, don't go on trying to match her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes as if you were a draper,
and they a bit of ribbon; say at once `her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes are loadstars,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and
have done with it! I set up Molly's grey eyes and curling black
lashes, long odds above the other young woman's; but, of course, it's
all a matter of taste.''

<p/>And now both Osborne and Roger had left the neighbourhood. In spite
of all that Mrs. Gibson had said about Roger's visits being ill-timed
and intrusive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) began to feel as if they had been a very pleasant
variety, now that they had ceased altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brought in a whiff
of a new atmosphere from that of Hollingford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother had
been always ready to do numberless little things which only a man can
do for women; small services which Mr. Gibson was always too busy to
render. For the good doctor's business grew upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought that
this increase was owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) greater skill and experience, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
would probably have been mortified if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could have known how many
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) patients were solely biassed in sending for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), by the fact
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was employed at the Towers. Something of this sort must have
been contemplated in the low scale of payment adopted long ago by
the Cumnor family. Of itself the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) received for going to the
Towers would hardly have paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) for horse-flesh, but then, as Lady
Cumnor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) younger days had worded it,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is such a thing for a man just setting up in practice for himself
to be able to say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attends at this house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/>So the prestige was tacitly sold and paid for; but neither buyer nor
seller defined the nature of the bargain.

<p/>On the whole, it was as well that Mr. Gibson spent so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
time from home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sometimes thought so himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
wife's plaintive fret or pretty babble over totally indifferent
things, and perceived of how flimsy a nature were all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fine
sentiments. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not allow himself to repine over the step
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had taken; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wilfully shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes and waxed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ears to many
small things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew would have irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had attended
to them; and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) solitary rides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) forced himself to dwell on
the positive advantages that had accrued to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) through his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had obtained an unexceptionable chaperone, if not a
tender mother, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) little girl; a skilful manager of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) previous
disorderly household; a woman who was graceful and pleasant to
look at for the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) table. Moreover, Cynthia reckoned for
something on the favourable side of the balance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was a capital
companion for Molly; and the two were evidently very fond of each
other. The feminine companionship of the mother and daughter was
agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) as well as to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) child,--when Mrs. Gibson was
moderately sensible and not over-sentimental, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) mentally added; and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) checked himself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would not allow himself to become
more aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) faults and foibles by defining them. At any rate,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was harmless, and wonderfully just to Molly for a stepmother.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) piqued herself upon this indeed, and would often call attention
to the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) being unlike other women in this respect. Just
then sudden tears came into Mr. Gibson's eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) remembered how
quiet and undemonstrative his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) little Molly had become in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) general
behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); but how once or twice, when they had met upon the
stairs, or were otherwise unwitnessed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) and kissed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)--hand or cheek--in a sad passionateness of affection. But in a
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) began to whistle an old Scotch air he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had heard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
childhood, and which had never recurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) memory since; and
five minutes afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was too busily treating a case of white
swelling in the knee of a little boy, and thinking how to relieve the
poor mother, who went out charring all day, and had to listen to the
moans of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child all night, to have any thought for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own cares,
which, if they really existed, were of so trifling a nature compared
to the hard reality of this hopeless woe.

<p/>Osborne came home first. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) returned, in fact, not long after Roger
had gone away; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was languid and unwell, and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did
not complain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt unequal to any exertion. Thus a week or more
elapsed before any of the Gibsons knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was at the Hall; and
then it was only by chance that they became aware of it. Mr. Gibson
met him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in one of the lanes near Hamley; the acute surgeon noticed
the gait of the man as he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) came near, before he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) recognized who it was.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Osborne, is it you? I thought it was an old man of fifty
loitering before me! I didn't know you had come back.''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``WHY, OSBORNE, IS IT YOU?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, <div class="bookquote">``I've been at home nearly ten days. I daresay
I ought to have called on your people, for I made a half promise to
Mrs. Gibson to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) know as soon as I returned; but the fact is,
I'm feeling very good-for-nothing,--this air oppresses me; I could
hardly breathe in the house, and yet I'm already tired with this
short walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better get home at once; and I'll call and see you as I come
back from Rowe's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you mustn't on any account!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, hastily; <div class="bookquote">``my father
is annoyed enough about my going from home, so often, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says, though
I hadn't been from it for six weeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) puts down all my languor
to my having been away,--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) keeps the purse-strings, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
added, with a faint smile, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm in the unlucky position of a
penniless heir, and I've been brought up so--In fact, I must leave
home from time to time, and, if my father gets confirmed in this
notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that my health is worse for my absences, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll stop the
supplies altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask where you do spend your time when you are not at Hamley
Hall?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Gibson, with some hesitation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>replied Osborne, reluctantly. <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you this:--I
stay with friends in the country. I lead a life which ought to be
conducive to health, because it is thoroughly simple, rational, and
happy. And now I've told you more about it than my father himself
knows. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never asks me where I've been; and I shouldn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did--at least, I think not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson rode on by Osborne's side, not speaking for a moment or
two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne, whatever scrapes you may have got into, I should advise
your telling your father boldly out. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll be
angry enough at first, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll come round, take my word for it;
and, somehow or another, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll find money to pay your debts and set
you free, if it's that kind of difficulty; and if it's any other
kind of entanglement, why still he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s your best friend. It's this
estrangement from your father that's telling on your health, I'll be
bound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon; but it's not that; I am
really out of order. I daresay my unwillingness to encounter any
displeasure from my father is the consequence of my indisposition;
but I'll answer for it, it is not the cause of it. My instinct tells
me there is something really the matter with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, don't be setting up your instinct against the profession,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, cheerily.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) dismounted, and throwing the reins of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) horse round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
looked at Osborne's tongue and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) pulse, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) various
questions. At the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll soon bring you about, though I should like a little more quiet
talk with you, without this tugging brute for a third. If you'll
manage to ride over and lunch with us to-morrow, Dr. Nicholls will
be with us; he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>)'s coming over to see old Rowe; and you shall have the
benefit of the advice of two doctors instead of one. Go home now,
you've had enough exercise for the middle of a day as hot as this is.
And don't mope in the house, listening to the maunderings of your
stupid instinct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else have I to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``My father and I are not
companions; one can't read and write for ever, especially when
there's no end to be gained by it. I don't mind telling you--but in
confidence, recollect--that I've been trying to get some of my poems
published; but there's no one like a publisher for taking the conceit
out of one. Not a man among them would have them as a gift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oho! so that's it, is it, Master Osborne? I thought there was some
mental cause for this depression of health. I wouldn't trouble my
head about it, if I were you, though that's always very easily said,
I know. Try your hand at prose, if you can't manage to please the
publishers with poetry; but, at any rate, don't go on fretting
over spilt milk. But I mustn't lose my time here. Come over to us
to-morrow, as I said; and what with the wisdom of two doctors, and
the wit and folly of three women, I think we shall cheer you up a
bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>So saying, Mr. Gibson remounted, and rode away at the long, slinging
trot so well known to the country people as the doctor's pace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) looks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Gibson to himself at night,
as over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daybooks he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reviewed the events of the day. <div class="bookquote">``And then
his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) pulse. But how often we're all mistaken; and, ten to one, my own
hidden enemy lies closer to me than his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) does to him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)--even taking the
worse view of the case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) appearance a considerable time before luncheon
the next morning; and no one objected to the earliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) call.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was feeling better. There were few signs of the invalid about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); and what few there were disappeared under the bright pleasant
influence of such a welcome as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) received from all. Molly and
Cynthia had much to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of the small proceedings since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went
away, or to relate the conclusions of half-accomplished projects.
Cynthia was often on the point of some gay, careless inquiry as
to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been doing; but Molly, who
conjectured the truth, as often interfered to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) the pain of
equivocation--a pain that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tender conscience would have felt for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would have felt it for himself.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson's talk was desultory, complimentary, and sentimental,
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usual fashion; but still, on the whole, though Osborne
smiled to himself at much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) said, it was soothing and
agreeable. Presently, Dr. Nicholls and Mr. Gibson came in; the former
had had some conference with the latter on the subject of Osborne's
health; and, from time to time, the skilful old physician's sharp and
observant eyes gave a comprehensive look at Osborne.

<p/>Then there was lunch, when every one was merry and hungry, excepting
the hostess, who was trying to train her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) midday appetite into
the genteelest of all ways, and thought -LRB-falsely enough-RRB- that Dr.
Nicholls was a good person to practise the semblance of ill-health
upon, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) the proper civil amount of
commiseration for her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) ailments, which every guest ought to bestow
upon a hostess who complains of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) delicacy of health. The old
doctor was too cunning a man to fall into this trap. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would keep
recommending her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) to try the coarsest viands on the table; and, at
last, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) could not fancy the cold beef to try a
little with pickled onions. There was a twinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said
this, that would have betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) humour to any observer; but Mr.
Gibson, Cynthia, and Molly were all attacking Osborne on the subject
of some literary preference he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had expressed, and Dr. Nicholls had
Mrs. Gibson quite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) mercy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not sorry when luncheon was
over to leave the room to the three gentlemen; and ever afterwards
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) spoke of Dr. Nicholls as <div class="bookquote">``that bear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Nicholls/Nicholls</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently, Osborne came upstairs, and, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) old fashion, began
to take up new books, and to question the girls as to their music.
Mrs. Gibson had to go out and pay some calls, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) left the three
together; and after a while they adjourned into the garden, Osborne
lounging on a chair, while Molly employed herself busily in tying up
carnations, and Cynthia gathered flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) careless, graceful
way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you notice the difference in our occupations, Mr. Hamley.
Molly, you see, devotes herself to the useful, and I to the
ornamental. Please, under what head do you class what you are doing?
I think you might help one of us, instead of looking on like the
Grand Seigneur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>), rather plaintively. <div class="bookquote">``I should
like to be useful, but I don't know how; and my day is past for
purely ornamental work. You must let me be, I'm afraid. Besides, I'm
really rather exhausted by being questioned and pulled about by those
good doctors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't mean to say they have been attacking you since
lunch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; indeed, they have; and they might have gone on till now if Mrs.
Gibson had not come in opportunely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought mamma had gone out some time ago!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, catching
wafts of the conversation as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) flitted hither and thither among the
flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came into the dining-room not five minutes ago. Do you want her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>),
for I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) crossing the hall at this very moment?''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>and Osborne
half rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``Only she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) seemed to be in such a
hurry to go out, I fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had set off long ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had some
errand to do for Lady Cumnor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) could manage to
catch the housekeeper, who is always in the town on Thursday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are the family coming to the Towers this autumn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so. But I don't know, and I don't much care. They don't
take kindly to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>continued Cynthia, <div class="bookquote">``and so I suppose I'm not
generous enough to take kindly to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought that such a very unusual blot in their
discrimination would have interested you in them as extraordinary
people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, with a little air of conscious gallantry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't that a compliment?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, after a pause of mock
meditation. <div class="bookquote">``If any one pays me a compliment, please let it be short
and clear. I'm very stupid at finding out hidden meanings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then such speeches as `you are very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or `you have charming
manners,<div class="bookquote">'' are what you prefer. Now, I pique myself on wrapping up my
sugar-plums delicately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then would you please to write them down, and at my leisure I'll
parse them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! It would be too much trouble. I'll meet you half-way, and study
clearness next time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you two talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, resting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) light
spade.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only a discussion on the best way of administering
compliments,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) flower-basket again, but
not going out of the reach of the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like them at all in any way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``But, perhaps,
it's rather sour grapes with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you what I heard of you at
the ball?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or shall I provoke Mr. Preston,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, <div class="bookquote">``to begin upon you?
It's like turning a tap, such a stream of pretty speeches flows out
at the moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) lip curled with scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For you, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``but not for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For any woman. It's his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) notion of making himself agreeable. If you
dare me, Molly, I'll try the experiment, and you'll see with what
success.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't, pray!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in a hurry. <div class="bookquote">``I do so dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, roused to a little curiosity by her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) vehemence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I don't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) never seems to know what one is feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) wouldn't care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) did know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) might know
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) is not wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) chooses to stay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) cares little whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) is wanted or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, this is very interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``It is like the
strophe and anti-strophe in a Greek chorus. Pray, go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, by sight, and I think we were once introduced. But, you know,
we are much farther from Ashcombe, at Hamley, than you are here, at
Hollingford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s coming to take Mr. Sheepshanks' place, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'ll
live here altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly! who told you that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, in quite a different tone
of voice from that in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been speaking hitherto.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa,--didn't you hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)? Oh, no! it was before you were down this
morning. Papa met Mr. Sheepshanks yesterday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) it was
all settled: you know we heard a rumour about it in the spring!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia was very silent after this. Presently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
gathered all the flowers she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) wanted, and that the heat was so great
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would go indoors. And then Osborne went away. But Molly had set
herself a task to dig up such roots as had already flowered, and to
put down some bedding-out plants in their stead. Tired and heated as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) finished it, and then went upstairs to rest, and change
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dress. According to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wont, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sought for Cynthia; there was
no reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) soft knock at the bedroom-door opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own,
and, thinking that Cynthia might have fallen asleep, and be lying
uncovered in the draught of the open window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went in softly.
Cynthia was lying upon the bed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had thrown herself down on
it without caring for the ease or comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) position. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was
very still; and Molly took a shawl, and was going to place it over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes, and spoke,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, dear? Don't go. I like to know that you are there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes again, and remained quite quiet for a few minutes
longer. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) started up into a sitting posture, pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hair
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) forehead and burning eyes, and gazed intently at Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what I've been thinking, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I think I've
been long enough here, and that I had better go out as a governess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia! what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, aghast. <div class="bookquote">``You've been
asleep--you've been dreaming. You're over-tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
sitting down on the bed, and taking Cynthia's passive hand, and
stroking it softly--a mode of caressing that had come down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother--whether as an hereditary instinct, or as a lingering
remembrance of the tender ways of the dead woman, Mr. Gibson often
wondered within himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) observed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how good you are, Molly! I wonder, if I had been brought up like
you, whether I should have been as good. But I've been tossed about
so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, don't go and be tossed about any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear! I had better go. But, you see, no one ever loved me like
you, and, I think, your father--doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), Molly? And it's hard to
be driven out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia, I am sure you're not well, or else you're not half awake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia sate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) arms encircling her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) knees, and looking at
vacancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), at last, heaving a great sigh; but, then, smiling
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) caught Molly's anxious face, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose there's no escaping
one's doom; and anywhere else I should be much more forlorn and
unprotected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by your doom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's telling, little one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, who seemed now to
have recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) usual manner. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to have one, though. I
think that, though I am an arrant coward at heart, I can show fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, really anxious to probe the mystery--if,
indeed, there was one--to the bottom, in the hope of some remedy
being found for the distress Cynthia was in when first Molly entered.

<p/>Again Cynthia was lost in thought; then, catching the echo of Molly's
last words in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`With whom?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--oh! show fight with whom?--why, my doom, to be sure.
Am not I a grand young lady to have a doom? Why, Molly, child, how
pale and grave you look!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) all of a sudden. <div class="bookquote">``You
ought not to care so much for me; I'm not good enough for you to
worry yourself about me. I've given myself up a long time ago as a
heartless baggage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! I wish you wouldn't talk so, Cynthia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I wish you wouldn't always take me `at the foot of the letter,''
 (<font color='red'><b>an girl</b></font>)</div>as an English girl at school used to translate it. Oh, how hot it
is! Is it never going to get cool again? My child! what dirty hands
you've got, and face too; and I've been kissing you--I daresay I'm
dirty with it, too. Now, isn't that like one of mamma's speeches?
But, for all that, you look more like a delving Adam than a spinning
Eve.'' This had the effect that Cynthia intended; the daintily clean
Molly became conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) soiled condition, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
forgotten while she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been attending to Cynthia, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hastily
withdrew to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own room. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had gone, Cynthia noiselessly
locked the door; and, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) purse out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) desk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) began to
count over her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) counted it once--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) counted it twice, as
if desirous of finding out some mistake which should prove it to be
more than it was; but the end of it all was a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fool!--what a fool I was!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), at length. <div class="bookquote">``But even if
I don't go out as a governess, I shall make it up in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Some weeks after the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had anticipated when he (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had spoken of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) departure to the Gibsons, Roger returned back to the Hall. One
morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) called, Osborne told them that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother had been
at home for two or three days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why has he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) not come here, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``It is not
kind of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) not to come and see us as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) can. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) I say
so--pray do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne had gained one or two ideas as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) treatment of Roger the
last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had called. Roger had not complained of it, or even
mentioned it, till that very morning; when Osborne was on the point
of starting, and had urged Roger to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), the latter had
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) something of what Mrs. Gibson had said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke rather as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was more amused than annoyed; but Osborne could read that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
was chagrined at those restrictions placed upon calls which were the
greatest pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) life. Neither of them let out the suspicion
which had entered both their minds--the well-grounded suspicion
arising from the fact that Osborne's visits, be they paid early or
late, had never yet been met with a repulse.

<p/>Osborne now reproached himself with having done Mrs. Gibson
injustice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was evidently a weak, but probably a disinterested,
woman; and it was only a little bit of ill-temper on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) part which
had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to speak to Roger as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay it was rather impertinent of me to call at such an
untimely hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all; I call at all hours, and nothing is ever said about it.
It was just because she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was put out that morning. I'll answer for it
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s sorry now, and I'm sure you may go there at any time you like
in the future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Still, Roger did not choose to go again for two or three weeks, and
the consequence was that the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) called the ladies were out.
Once again he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had the same ill-luck, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) received a little
pretty three-cornered note from Mrs. Gibson:--


<p/>MY DEAR SIR,

<p/>How is it that you are become so formal all on a sudden,
leaving cards, instead of awaiting our return? Fie for
shame! If you had seen the faces of disappointment that
I did when the horrid little bits of pasteboard were
displayed to our view, you would not have borne malice
against me so long; for it is really punishing others as
well as my naughty self. If you will come to-morrow--as
early as you like--and lunch with us, I'll own I was
cross, and acknowledge myself a penitent.--Yours ever,

<p/>HYACINTH C. K. GIBSON.


<p/>There was no resisting this, even if there had not been strong
inclination to back up the pretty words. Roger went, and Mrs. Gibson
caressed and petted him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sweetest, silkiest manner. Cynthia
looked lovelier than ever to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) for the slight restriction that
had been laid for a time on their intercourse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) might be gay
and sparkling with Osborne; with Roger she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was soft and grave.
Instinctively she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) men. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) saw that Osborne was only
interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) position in a family with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
was intimate; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friendship was without the least touch of
sentiment; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) admiration was only the warm criticism of
an artist for unusual beauty. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) felt how different Roger's
relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was _the_ one, alone, peerless. If
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love was prohibited, it would be long years before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could
sink down into tepid friendship; and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) personal loveliness
was only one of the many charms that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tremble into passion.
Cynthia was not capable of returning such feelings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had had too
little true love in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) life, and perhaps too much admiration to do
so; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) appreciated this honest ardour, this loyal worship that
was new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) experience. Such appreciation, and such respect for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) true and affectionate nature, gave a serious tenderness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
manner to Roger, which allured him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) with a fresh and separate grace.
Molly sate by, and wondered how it would all end, or, rather, how
soon it would all end, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought that no girl could resist such
reverent passion; and on Roger's side there could be no doubt--alas!
there could be no doubt. An older spectator might have looked far
ahead, and thought of the question of pounds, shillings, and pence.
Where was the necessary income for a marriage to come from? Roger
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) Fellowship now, it is true; but the income of that would be
lost if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) married; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had no profession, and the life interest of
the two or three thousand pounds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother,
belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father. This older spectator might have been a little
surprised at the _empressement_ of Mrs. Gibson's manner to a younger
son, always supposing this said spectator to have read to the depths
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) worldly heart. Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) tried to be more agreeable to
Osborne; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) attempt was a great failure when practised
upon Roger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not know what to say in reply to the delicate
flatteries which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt to be insincere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) intended
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to consider himself henceforward free of the house; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was
too glad to avail himself of this privilege to examine over-closely
into what might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) motives for her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) change of manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
eyes, and chose to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was now desirous of making up for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) little burst of temper on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) previous visit.

<p/>The result of Osborne's conference with the two doctors had been
certain prescriptions which appeared to have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) much good,
and which would in all probability have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) yet more, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
have been free of the recollection of the little patient wife in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) solitude near Winchester. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could; and,
thanks to Roger, money was far more plentiful with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) now than it
had been. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) still shrank, and perhaps even more and more, from
telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) marriage. Some bodily instinct made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
dread all agitation inexpressibly. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not had this money from
Roger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might have been compelled to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father all, and to
ask for the necessary funds to provide for the wife and the coming
child. But with enough in hand, and a secret, though remorseful,
conviction that as long as Roger had a penny his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother was sure to
have half of it, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) more reluctant than ever to irritate his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
father by a revelation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) secret. <div class="bookquote">``Not just yet, not just at
present,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) kept saying both to Roger and to himself. <div class="bookquote">``By-and-by, if
we have a boy, I will call it Roger'' (<font color='red'><b>father son offspring</b></font>)</div>--and then visions of poetical
and romantic reconciliations brought about between father and son,
through the medium of a child, the offspring of a forbidden marriage,
became still more vividly possible to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and at any rate it was a
staving-off of an unpleasant thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) atoned to himself for taking
so much of Roger's Fellowship money by reflecting that, if Roger
married, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would lose this source of revenue; yet Osborne was
throwing no impediment in the way of this event, rather forwarding it
by promoting every possible means of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother's seeing the lady of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love. Osborne ended his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) reflections by convincing himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
own generosity.




<p/>CHAPTER XXX.

<p/>OLD WAYS AND NEW WAYS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>Mr. Preston was now installed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) new house at Hollingford; Mr.
Sheepshanks having entered into dignified idleness at the house of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) married daughter, who lived in the county town. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) successor
had plunged with energy into all manner of improvements; and
among others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) fell to draining a piece of outlying waste and
unreclaimed land of Lord Cumnor's, which was close to Squire Hamley's
property--that very piece for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had had the Government grant,
but which now lay neglected, and only half drained, with stacks of
mossy tiles, and lines of upturned furrows telling of abortive plans.
It was not often that the Squire rode in this direction now-a-days;
but the cottage of a man who had been the squire's gamekeeper
in those more prosperous days when the Hamleys could afford to
<div class="bookquote">``preserve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hamleys/Mr. Hamleys</b></font>)</div>was close to the rush-grown ground. This old servant and
tenant was ill, and had sent a message up to the Hall, asking to see
the Squire: not to reveal any secret, or to say anything particular,
but only from the feudal loyalty, which made it seem to the dying man
as if it would be a comfort to shake the hand, and look once more
into the eyes of the lord and master whom he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had served, and whose
ancestors his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own forbears had served for so many generations. And
the Squire was as fully alive as old Silas to the claims of the tie
that existed between them. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) hated the thought, and still
more, should hate the sight of the piece of land, on the side of
which Silas's cottage stood, the Squire ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) horse, and rode
off within half-an-hour of receiving the message. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) drew near
the spot he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heard the sound of tools, and the hum of
many voices, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) used to hear them a year or two before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
listened with surprise. Yes! Instead of the still solitude he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
expected, there was the clink of iron, the heavy gradual thud of the
fall of barrows-ful of soil--the cry and shout of labourers. But not
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) land--better worth expense and trouble by far than the reedy
clay common on which the men were, in fact, employed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) knew it was
Lord Cumnor's property; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) knew Lord Cumnor and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) family had
gone up in the world -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``the Whig rascals!'' (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, both in wealth and in
station, as the Hamleys had gone down. But all the same--in spite
of long known facts, and in spite of reason--the Squire's ready
anger rose high at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) neighbour doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been
unable to do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) a Whig, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) family only in the county since
Queen Anne's time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) went so far as to wonder whether they might
not--the labourers he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) meant--avail themselves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tiles, lying so
conveniently close to hand. All these thoughts, regrets, and wonders
were in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) rode up to the cottage he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was bound to, and
gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) horse in charge to a little lad, who had hitherto found his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
morning's business and amusement in playing at <div class="bookquote">``houses''  (<font color='red'><b>a lad</b></font>)</div>with a still
younger sister, with some of the Squire's neglected tiles. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
was old Silas's grandson, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might have battered the rude red
earthenware to pieces--a whole stack--one by one, and the Squire
would have said little or nothing. It was only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would not
spare one to a labourer of Lord Cumnor's. No! not one.

<p/>Old Silas lay in a sort of closet, opening out of the family
living-room. The small window that gave it light looked right on to
the <div class="bookquote">``moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as it was called; and by day the check curtain was drawn
aside so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) might watch the progress of the labour. Everything
about the old man was clean, if coarse; and, with Death, the
leveller, so close at hand, it was the labourer who made the first
advances, and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) horny hand to the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd come, Squire. Your father came for to see my father
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) lay a-dying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, my man!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, easily affected, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) always
was. <div class="bookquote">``Don't talk of dying, we shall soon have you out, never fear.
They've sent you up some soup from the Hall, as I bade 'em, haven't
they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, I've had all as I could want for to eat and to drink. The
young squire and Master Roger was here yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm a deal nearer Heaven to-day, I am. I should like you to look
after th' covers in th' West Spinney, Squire; them gorse, you know,
where th' old fox had her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hole--her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) as give 'em so many a run. You'll
mind it, Squire, though you was but a lad. I could laugh to think on
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) tricks yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, with a weak attempt at a laugh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) got himself
into a violent fit of coughing, which alarmed the squire, who thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would never get his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) breath again. His (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) daughter-in-law came in
at the sound, and told the Squire that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had these coughing-bouts
very frequently, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would go off in one of them
before long. This opinion of hers was spoken simply out before the
old man, who now lay gasping and exhausted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pillow. Poor
people acknowledge the inevitableness and the approach of death in
a much more straightforward manner than is customary among more
educated folk. The Squire was shocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) hard-heartedness, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) considered it; but the old man himself had received much tender
kindness from his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) daughter-in-law; and what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) had just said was no
more news to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) than the fact that the sun would rise to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
was more anxious to go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them navvies--I call 'em navvies because some on 'em is strangers,
though some on 'em is th' men as was turned off your own works,
squire, when there came orders to stop 'em last fall--they're
a-pulling up gorse and brush to light their fire for warming up their
messes. It's a long way off to their homes, and they mostly dine
here; and there'll be nothing of a cover left, if you don't see after
'em. I thought I should like to tell ye afore I died. Parson's been
here; but I did na tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>)'s all for the earl's folk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>)'d
not ha' heeded. It's the earl as put him (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) church, I reckon,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) said what a fine thing it were for to see so much employment
a-given to the poor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) never said nought o' th' sort when your
works were agait, Squire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This long speech had been interrupted by many a cough and gasp for
breath; and having delivered himself of what was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) face to the wall, and appeared to be going to sleep.
Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) roused himself with a start:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I flogged him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) well, I did. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) were after pheasants' eggs,
and I didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) were an orphan. Lord, forgive me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s thinking on David Morton, the cripple, as used to go about
trapping vermin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>whispered the woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) died long ago--twenty year, I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>replied the
Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, but when grandfather goes off i' this way to sleep after a bout
of talking he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) seems to be dreaming on old times. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'ll not waken up
yet, sir; you'd best sit down if you'd like to stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continued,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went into the house-place and dusted a chair with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) apron.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was very particular in bidding me wake him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) were asleep, and
you or Mr. Roger was to call. Mr. Roger said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d be coming again
this morning--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll likely sleep an hour or more, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s let
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd said good-by, I should like to have done that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) drops off so sudden,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. <div class="bookquote">``But if you'd be better
pleased to have said it, Squire, I'll waken him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) up a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>the Squire called out as the woman was going to be as good
as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) word. <div class="bookquote">``I'll come again, perhaps to-morrow. And tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) I was
sorry; for I am indeed. And be sure and send to the Hall for anything
you want! Mr. Roger is coming, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll bring me word how he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is,
later on. I should like to have bidden him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>So, giving sixpence to the child who had held his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) horse, the Squire
mounted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sate still a moment, looking at the busy work going on
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and then at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own half-completed drainage. It was a
bitter pill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had objected to borrowing from Government, in the
first instance; and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife had persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) to the step; and
after it was once taken, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was as proud as could be of the only
concession to the spirit of progress he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) ever made in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
read and studied the subject pretty thoroughly, if also very slowly,
during the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife had been influencing him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was tolerably
well up in agriculture, if in nothing else; and at one time he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
taken the lead among the neighbouring landowners, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) first began
tile-drainage. In those days people used to speak of Squire Hamley's
hobby; and at market ordinaries, or county dinners, they rather
dreaded setting him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) off on long repetitions of arguments from the
different pamphlets on the subject which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had read. And now the
proprietors all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) were draining--draining; his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) interest
to Government was running on all the same, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) works were
stopped, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tiles deteriorating in value. It was not a soothing
consideration, and the Squire was almost ready to quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wanted a vent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) ill-humour; and suddenly remembering
the devastations on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) covers, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had heard about not a
quarter of an hour before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) rode towards the men busy at work on
Lord Cumnor's land. Just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) got up to them he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) encountered
Mr. Preston, also on horseback, come to overlook his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) labourers. The
Squire did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) personally, but from the agent's manner
of speaking, and the deference that was evidently paid to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), Mr.
Hamley saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was a responsible person. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) addressed the
agent:--<div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, I suppose you are the manager of these
works?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the agent</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Preston replied,--<div class="bookquote">``Certainly. I am that and many other things
besides, at your service. I have succeeded Mr. Sheepshanks in the
management of my lord's property. Mr. Hamley of Hamley, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire bowed stiffly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not like his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) name to be asked or
presumed upon in that manner. An equal might conjecture who he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was,
or recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), but, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) announced himself, an inferior had no
right to do more than address him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) respectfully as <div class="bookquote">``sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>That was the
Squire's code of etiquette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Mr. Hamley of Hamley. I suppose you are as yet ignorant of the
boundary of Lord Cumnor's land, and so I will inform you that my
property begins at the pond yonder--just where you see the rise in
the ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly acquainted with that fact, Mr. Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Preston, a little annoyed at the ignorance attributed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But
may I inquire why my attention is called to it just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire was beginning to boil over; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tried to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
temper in. The effort was very much to be respected, for it was a
great one. There was something in the handsome and well-dressed
agent's tone and manner inexpressibly irritating to the squire, and
it was not lessened by an involuntary comparison of the capital
roadster on which Mr. Preston was mounted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) own ill-groomed
and aged cob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been told that your men out yonder do not respect these
boundaries, but are in the habit of plucking up gorse from my covers
to light their fires.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is possible they may!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Preston, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) eyebrows,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) manner being more nonchalant than his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) words. <div class="bookquote">``I daresay they
think no great harm of it. However, I'll inquire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you doubt my word, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, fretting his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mare till
she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) began to dance about. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you I've heard it only within this
last half-hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to doubt your word, Mr. Hamley; it's the last thing
I should think of doing. But you must excuse my saying that the
argument which you have twice brought up for the authenticity of your
statement, `that you have heard it within the last half-hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is not
quite so forcible as to preclude the possibility of a mistake.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd only say in plain language that you doubt my word,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, clenching and slightly raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) horsewhip. <div class="bookquote">``I
can't make out what you mean--you use so many words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't lose your temper, sir. I said I should inquire. You have
not seen the men pulling up gorse yourself, or you would have named
it. I, surely, may doubt the correctness of your information until
I have made some inquiry; at any rate, that is the course I shall
pursue, and if it gives you offence, I shall be sorry, but I shall
do it just the same. When I am convinced that harm has been done to
your property, I shall take steps to prevent it for the future, and
of course, in my lord's name, I shall pay you compensation--it may
probably amount to half-a-crown.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) added these last words in a
lower tone, as if to himself, with a slight contemptuous smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quiet, mare, quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, totally unaware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was
the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) impatient movements by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was perpetually
tightening her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) reins; and also, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) unconsciously addressed
the injunction to himself.

<p/>Neither of them saw Roger Hamley, who was just then approaching them
with long, steady steps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father from the door of old
Silas's cottage, and, as the poor fellow was still asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was
coming to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) father, and was near enough now to hear the
next words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know who you are, but I've known land-agents who were
gentlemen, and I've known some who were not. You belong to this last
set, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>said the squire, <div class="bookquote">``that you do. I should like to try
my horsewhip on you for your insolence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, Mr. Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Preston, coolly, <div class="bookquote">``curb your temper a
little, and reflect. I really feel sorry to see a man of your age in
such a passion:'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>--moving a little farther off, however, but really
more with a desire to save the irritated man from carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threat
into execution, out of a dislike to the slander and excitement it
would cause, than from any personal dread. Just at this moment Roger
Hamley came close up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was panting a little, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) eyes were very
stern and dark; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) spoke quietly enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Preston, I can hardly understand what you mean by your last
words. But, remember, my father is a gentleman of age and position,
and not accustomed to receive advice as to the management of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
temper from young men like you.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: THE BURNING OF THE GORSE.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I desired him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) men off my land,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire wish</b></font>)</div>said the Squire to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son--his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wish to stand well in Roger's opinion restraining his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
temper a little; but though his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) words might be a little calmer, there
were all other signs of passion present--the discoloured complexion,
the trembling hands, the fiery cloud in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) refused, and
doubted my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Preston turned to Roger, as if appealing from Philip drunk to
Philip sober, and spoke in a tone of cool explanation, which, though
not insolent in words, was excessively irritating in manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father has misunderstood me--perhaps it is no wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>trying
to convey, by a look of intelligence at the son, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) opinion that the
father was in no state to hear reason. <div class="bookquote">``I never refused to do what
was just and right. I only required further evidence as to the past
wrong-doing; your father took offence at this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shrugged
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shoulders, and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyebrows in a manner he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had formerly
learnt in France.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, sir! I can scarcely reconcile the manner and words
to my father, which I heard you use when I first came up, with the
deference you ought to have shown to a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age and position.
As to the fact of the trespass--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are pulling up all the gorse, Roger--there'll be no cover
whatever for game soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>put in the Squire.

<p/>Roger bowed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father, but took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) speech at the point it was
at before the interruption.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will inquire into it myself at a cooler moment; and if I find that
such trespass or damage has been committed, of course I shall expect
that you will see it put a stop to. Come, father! I am going to
see old Silas--perhaps you don't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) is very ill.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
endeavoured to wile the Squire away to prevent further words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was
not entirely successful.

<p/>Mr. Preston was enraged by Roger's calm and dignified manner,
and threw after them this parting shaft, in the shape of a loud
soliloquy,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Position, indeed! What are we to think of the position of a man who
begins works like these without counting the cost, and comes to a
stand-still, and has to turn off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) labourers just at the beginning
of winter, leaving--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>They were too far off to hear the rest. The Squire was on the point
of turning back before this, but Roger took hold of the reins of the
old mare, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) over some of the boggy ground, as if to guide
her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) into sure footing, but, in reality, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was determined to
prevent the renewal of the quarrel. It was well that the cob knew
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and was, indeed, old enough to prefer quietness to dancing; for
Mr. Hamley plucked hard at the reins, and at last broke out with an
oath,--<div class="bookquote">``Damn it, Roger! I'm not a child; I won't be treated as such.
Leave go, I say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger let go; they were now on firm ground, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not wish any
watchers to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was exercising any constraint over his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
father; and this quiet obedience to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) impatient commands did more
to soothe the Squire than anything else could have effected just
then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I turned them off--what could I do? I'd no more money for
their weekly wages; it's a loss to me, as you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) doesn't know,
no one knows, but I think your mother would, how it cut me to turn
'em off just before winter set in. I lay awake many a night thinking
of it, and I gave them what I had--I did, indeed. I hadn't got money
to pay 'em, but I had three barren cows fattened, and gave every
scrap of meat to the men, and I let 'em go into the woods and gather
what was fallen, and I winked at their breaking off old branches, and
now to have it cast up against me by that cur--that servant. But I'll
go on with the works, by --, I will, if only to spite him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). I'll
show him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) who I am. My position, indeed! A Hamley of Hamley takes a
higher position than his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master. I'll go on with the works, see if
I don't! I'm paying between one and two hundred a year interest on
Government money. I'll raise some more if I go to the Jews; Osborne
has shown me the way, and Osborne shall pay for it--he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) shall. I'll
not put up with insults. You shouldn't have stopped me, Roger! I wish
to heaven I'd horsewhipped the fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was lashing himself again into an impotent rage, painful to a son
to witness; but just then the little grandchild of old Silas, who
had held the Squire's horse during his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) visit to the sick man, came
running up, breathless:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, sir, please, squire, mammy has sent me; grandfather has
wakened up sudden, and mammy says he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'s dying, and would you please
come; she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'d take it as a kind compliment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)'s sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>So they went to the cottage, the Squire speaking never a word, but
suddenly feeling as if lifted out of a whirlwind and set down in a
still and awful place.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXI.

<p/>A PASSIVE COQUETTE.


<p/>It is not to be supposed that such an encounter as Mr. Preston had
just had with Roger Hamley sweetened the regards in which the two
young men henceforward held each other. They had barely spoken to one
another before, and but seldom met; for the land-agent's employment
had hitherto lain at Ashcombe, some sixteen or seventeen miles from
Hamley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was older than Roger by several years; but during the
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been in the county Osborne and Roger had been at school
and at college. Mr. Preston was prepared to dislike the Hamleys for
many unreasonable reasons. Cynthia and Molly had both spoken of
the brothers with familiar regard, implying considerable intimacy;
their flowers had been preferred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) on the occasion of the ball;
most people spoke well of them; and Mr. Preston had an animal's
instinctive jealousy and combativeness against all popular young men.
Their <div class="bookquote">``position'' (<font color='red'><b>Hamleys/Mr. Hamleys</b></font>)</div>--poor as the Hamleys might be--was far higher than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) own in the county; and, moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) was agent to the great Whig
lord, whose political interests were diametrically opposed to those
of the old Tory squire. Not that Lord Cumnor troubled himself much
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) political interests. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) family had obtained property and
title from the Whigs at the time of the Hanoverian succession; and
so, traditionally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was a Whig, and had belonged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) youth to
Whig clubs, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had lost considerable sums of money to Whig
gamblers. All this was satisfactory and consistent enough. And if
Lord Hollingford had not been returned for the county on the Whig
interest--as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) father had been before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>), until he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had succeeded
to the title--it is quite probable Lord Cumnor would have considered
the British constitution in danger, and the patriotism of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
ancestors ungratefully ignored. But, excepting at elections, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had
no notion of making Whig and Tory a party cry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tory</b></font>) had lived too much
in London, and was of too sociable a nature, to exclude any man who
jumped with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) humour from the hospitality he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always ready to
offer, be the agreeable acquaintance Whig, Tory, or Radical. But in
the county of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) was lord-lieutenant, the old party distinction
was still a shibboleth by which men were tested as to their fitness
for social intercourse, as well as on the hustings. If by any chance
a Whig found himself at a Tory dinner-table--or vice versâ--the food
was hard of digestion, and wine and viands were criticized rather
than enjoyed. A marriage between the young people of the separate
parties was almost as unheard-of and prohibited an alliance as that
of Romeo and Juliet's. And of course Mr. Preston was not a man in
whose breast such prejudices would die away. They were an excitement
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) for one thing, and called out all his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) talent for intrigue on
behalf of the party to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was allied. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) considered
it as loyalty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) employer to <div class="bookquote">``scatter his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) enemies''  (<font color='red'><b>employer</b></font>)</div>by any means
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had always hated and despised the Tories in general;
and after that interview on the marshy common in front of Silas's
cottage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) hated the Hamleys and Roger especially, with a very
choice and particular hatred. <div class="bookquote">``That prig,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as hereafter he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) always
designated Roger--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) shall pay for it yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) said to himself by
way of consolation, after the father and son had left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What a
lout it is!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--watching the receding figures, <div class="bookquote">``The old chap has twice
as much spunk,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>as the Squire tugged at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) bridle reins. <div class="bookquote">``The old
mare could make her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) way better without being led, my fine fellow. But
I see through your dodge. You're afraid of your old father turning
back and getting into another rage. Position indeed! a beggarly
squire--a man who did turn off his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) men just before winter, to rot
or starve, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) cared--it's just like a brutal old Tory.''  (<font color='red'><b>the labourers</b></font>)</div>And,
under the cover of sympathy with the dismissed labourers, Mr. Preston
indulged his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) own private pique very pleasantly.

<p/>Mr. Preston had many causes for rejoicing: he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) might have forgotten
this discomfiture, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) chose to feel it, in the remembrance of
an increase of income, and in the popularity he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) enjoyed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) new
abode. All Hollingford came forward to do the earl's new agent
honour. Mr. Sheepshanks had been a crabbed, crusty old bachelor,
frequenting inn-parlours on market days, not unwilling to give
dinners to three or four chosen friends and familiars, with whom,
in return, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) dined from time to time, and with whom, also, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) kept
up an amicable rivalry in the matter of wines. But he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``did not
appreciate female society,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as Miss Browning elegantly worded his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)
unwillingness to accept the invitations of the Hollingford ladies.
He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was even unrefined enough to speak of these invitations to his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)
intimate friends aforesaid as <div class="bookquote">``those old women's worrying,''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>but, of
course, they never heard of this. Little quarter-of-sheet notes,
without any envelopes--that invention was unknown in those days--but
sealed in the corners when folded up instead of gummed as they are
fastened at present--occasionally passed between Mr. Sheepshanks
and the Miss Brownings, Mrs. Goodenough or others. From the
first-mentioned ladies the form ran as follows:--<div class="bookquote">``Miss Browning
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) sister, Miss Phoebe Browning, present their respectful
compliments to Mr. Sheepshanks, and beg to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) that a few
friends have kindly consented to favour them with their company at
tea on Thursday next. Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe will take it
very kindly if Mr. Sheepshanks will join their little circle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>Now for Mrs. Goodenough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Goodenough's respects to Mr. Sheepshanks, and hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) is in
good health. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) would be very glad if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) would favour her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>)
company to tea on Monday. My daughter, in Combermere, has sent me a
couple of guinea-fowls, and Mrs. Goodenough hopes Mr. Sheepshanks
will stay and take a bit of supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No need for the dates of the days of the month. The good ladies would
have thought that the world was coming to an end if the invitation
had been sent out a week before the party therein named. But not even
guinea-fowls for supper could tempt Mr. Sheepshanks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) remembered
the made-wines he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) had tasted in former days at Hollingford parties,
and shuddered. Bread-and-cheese, with a glass of bitter-beer, or a
little brandy-and-water, partaken of in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) old clothes -LRB-which had
worn into shapes of loose comfort, and smelt strongly of tobacco-RRB-,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) liked better than roast guinea-fowl and birch-wine, even without
throwing into the balance the stiff uneasy coat, and the tight
neckcloth and tighter shoes. So the ex-agent had been seldom, if
ever, seen at the Hollingford tea-parties. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) might have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) form
of refusal stereotyped, it was so invariably the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sheepshanks' duty to Miss Browning and her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) sister''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>-LRB-to Mrs.
Goodenough, or to others, as the case might be-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Business of
importance prevents him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) from availing himself of their polite
invitation; for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) begs to return his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) best thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>But now that Mr. Preston had succeeded, and come to live in
Hollingford, things were changed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) accepted every civility right and left, and won golden opinions
accordingly. Parties were made in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) honour, <div class="bookquote">``just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) had been
a bride,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>Miss Phoebe Browning said; and to all of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the man after?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sheepshanks/Sheepshanks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sheepshanks to himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>)
heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) successor's affability, and sociability, and amiability,
and a variety of other agreeable <div class="bookquote">``ilities,''  (<font color='red'><b>successor</b></font>)</div>from the friends whom the
old steward still retained at Hollingford. <div class="bookquote">``Preston's not a man to
put himself out for nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s deep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'ll be after something
solider than popularity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The bachelor</b></font>)</div><p/>The sagacious old bachelor was right. Mr. Preston was <div class="bookquote">``after''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>something more than mere popularity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) went wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had a chance
of meeting Cynthia Kirkpatrick.

<p/>It might be that Molly's spirits were more depressed at this time
than they were in general; or that Cynthia was exultant, unawares to
herself, in the amount of attention and admiration she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was receiving
from Roger by day, from Mr. Preston in the evening, but the two girls
seemed to have parted company in cheerfulness. Molly was always
gentle, but very grave and silent. Cynthia, on the contrary, was
merry, full of pretty mockeries, and hardly ever silent. When first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) came to Hollingford one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) great charms had been that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
was such a gracious listener; now her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) excitement, by whatever caused,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) too restless to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tongue; yet what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said was too
pretty, too witty, not to be a winning and sparkling interruption,
eagerly welcomed by those who were under her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sway. Mr. Gibson was
the only one who observed this change, and reasoned upon it. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)'s
in a mental fever of some kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to himself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)'s very
fascinating, but I don't quite understand her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>If Molly had not been so entirely loyal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might have
thought this constant brilliancy a little tiresome when brought into
every-day life; it was not the sunshiny rest of a placid lake, it was
rather the glitter of the pieces of a broken mirror, which confuses
and bewilders. Cynthia would not talk quietly about anything now;
subjects of thought or conversation seemed to have lost their
relative value. There were exceptions to this mood of hers, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
sank into deep fits of silence, that would have been gloomy had it
not been for the never varying sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) temper. If there was
a little kindness to be done to either Mr. Gibson or Molly, Cynthia
was just as ready as ever to do it; nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) refuse to do anything
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother wished, however fidgety might be the humour that prompted
the wish. But in this latter case Cynthia's eyes were not quickened
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Molly was dejected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew not why. Cynthia had drifted a little
apart; that was not it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stepmother had whimsical moods; and if
Cynthia displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would oppress Molly with small kindnesses
and pseudo-affection. Or else everything was wrong, the world was
out of joint, and Molly had failed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mission to set it right,
and was to be blamed accordingly. But Molly was of too steady a
disposition to be much moved by the changeableness of an unreasonable
person. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might be annoyed, or irritated, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was not
depressed. That was not it. The real cause was certainly this. As
long as Roger was drawn to Cynthia, and sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own accord,
it had been a sore pain and bewilderment to Molly's heart; but it was
a straightforward attraction, and one which Molly acknowledged, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) humility and great power of loving, to be the most natural thing
in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would look at Cynthia's beauty and grace, and feel
as if no one could resist it. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) witnessed all the small
signs of honest devotion which Roger was at no pains to conceal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
thought, with a sigh, that surely no girl could help relinquishing
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart to such tender, strong keeping as Roger's character
ensured. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have been willing to cut off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) right hand,
if need were, to forward his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) attachment to Cynthia; and the
self-sacrifice would have added a strange zest to a happy crisis. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
was indignant at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) considered to be Mrs. Gibson's obtuseness
to so much goodness and worth; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) called Roger <div class="bookquote">``a country
lout,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>or any other depreciative epithet, Molly would pinch herself
in order to keep silent. But after all, those were peaceful days
compared to the present, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), seeing the wrong side of the
tapestry, after the wont of those who dwell in the same house with
a plotter, became aware that Mrs. Gibson had totally changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
behaviour to Roger, from some cause unknown to Molly.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was always exactly the same; <div class="bookquote">``steady as old Time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as Mrs.
Gibson called him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usual originality; <div class="bookquote">``a rock of strength,
under whose very shadow there is rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as Mrs. Hamley had once
spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). So the cause of Mrs. Gibson's altered manner lay not
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). Yet now he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was sure of a welcome, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) come at any hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
would. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was playfully reproved for having taken Mrs. Gibson's words
too literally, and for never coming before lunch. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reasons for such words to be valid, and should respect
them. And this was done out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) simplicity, and from no tinge of
malice. Then in their family conversations at home, Mrs. Gibson was
constantly making projects for throwing Roger and Cynthia together,
with so evident a betrayal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wish to bring about an engagement,
that Molly chafed at the net spread so evidently, and at Roger's
blindness in coming so willingly to be entrapped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
previous willingness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) former evidences of manly fondness for the
beautiful Cynthia; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) only saw plots of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was the victim, and
Cynthia the conscious if passive bait. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could not
have acted as Cynthia did; no, not even to gain Roger's love. Cynthia
heard and saw as much of the domestic background as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did, and yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) submitted to the rôle assigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)! To be sure, this rôle
would have been played by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) unconsciously; the things prescribed
were what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would naturally have done; but because they were
prescribed--by implication only, it is true--Molly would have
resisted; have gone out, for instance, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was expected to stay
at home; or have lingered in the garden when a long country walk was
planned. At last--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not help loving Cynthia, come what
would--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) determined to believe that Cynthia was entirely unaware of
all; but it was with an effort that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) brought herself to believe
it.

<p/>It may be all very pleasant <div class="bookquote">``to sport with Amaryllis in the shade,
or with the tangles of Neæra's hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>but young men at the outset of
their independent life have many other cares in this prosaic England
to occupy their time and their thoughts. Roger was Fellow of Trinity,
to be sure; and from the outside it certainly appeared as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
position, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) chose to keep unmarried, was a very easy
one. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was not a nature, however, to sink down into inglorious
ease, even had his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) fellowship income been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) disposal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
looked forward to an active life; in what direction he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not yet
determined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knew what were his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) talents and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tastes; and did
not wish the former to lie buried, nor the latter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) regarded
as gifts, fitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) for some peculiar work, to be disregarded or
thwarted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) rather liked awaiting an object, secure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own
energy to force his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) way to it, when once he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) saw it clearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
reserved enough of money for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own personal needs, which were
small, and for the ready furtherance of any project he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might see
fit to undertake; the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) income was Osborne's; given and
accepted in the spirit which made the bond between these two brothers
so rarely perfect. It was only the thought of Cynthia that threw
Roger off his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) balance. A strong man in everything else, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was as a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not marry and retain
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) fellowship; his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) intention was to hold himself loose from any
employment or profession until he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had found one to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind, so
there was no immediate prospect--no prospect for many years, indeed,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would be able to marry. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went on seeking Cynthia's
sweet company, listening to the music of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) voice, basking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
sunshine, and feeding his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) passion in every possible way, just like an
unreasoning child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knew that it was folly--and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did it; and
it was perhaps this that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) so sympathetic with Osborne. Roger
racked his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brains about Osborne's affairs much more frequently than
Osborne troubled himself. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had become so ailing and languid
of late, that even the Squire made only very faint objections to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) desire for frequent change of scene, though formerly he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) used to
grumble so much at the necessary expenditure it involved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After all, it doesn't cost much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>the Squire said to Roger one day.
<div class="bookquote">``Choose how he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) does it, he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) does it cheaply; he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) used to come and ask
me for twenty, where now he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) does it for five. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) and I have
lost each other's language, that's what we have! and my dictionary''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-only he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) called it <div class="bookquote">``dixonary'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``has all got wrong because of those
confounded debts--which he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) will never explain to me, or talk
about--he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) always holds me off at arm's length when I begin upon
it--he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) does, Roger--me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) old dad, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) primest favourite of
all, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was a little bit of a chap!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire dwelt so much upon Osborne's reserved behaviour to
himself, that brooding over this one subject perpetually he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) became
more morose and gloomy than ever in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) manner to Osborne, resenting
the want of the confidence and affection that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thus repelled. So
much so that Roger, who desired to avoid being made the receptacle
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father's complaints against Osborne--and Roger's passive
listening was the sedative his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father always sought--had often
to have recourse to the discussion of the drainage works as a
counter-irritant. The Squire had felt Mr. Preston's speech about
the dismissal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) work-people very keenly; it fell in with the
reproaches of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own conscience, though, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would repeat to
Roger over and over again,--<div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it--how could I?--I was
drained dry of ready money--I wish the land was drained as dry as
I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), with a touch of humour that came out before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was
aware, and at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) smiled sadly enough. <div class="bookquote">``What was I to do, I ask
you, Roger? I know I was in a rage--I've had a deal to make me so--and
maybe I didn't think as much about consequences as I should ha'
done, when I gave orders for 'em to be sent off; but I couldn't have
done otherwise if I'd ha' thought for a twelvemonth in cool blood.
Consequences! I hate consequences; they've always been against me;
they have. I'm so tied up I can't cut down a stick more, and that's a
`consequence' of having the property so deucedly well settled; I wish
I'd never had any ancestors. Ay, laugh, lad! it does me good to see
thee laugh a bit, after Osborne's long face, which always grows longer
at sight o' me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I'll manage somehow about
the money for the works. You trust to me; give me two months to turn
myself in, and you shall have some money, at any rate, to begin
with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) face brightened as a child's does
at the promise of a pleasure made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) by some one on whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) can
rely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) became a little graver, however, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``But how will
you get it? It's hard enough work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind; I'll get it--a hundred or so at first--I don't yet
know how--but remember, father, I'm a senior wrangler, and a `very
promising young writer,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>as that review called me. Oh, you don't know
what a fine fellow you've got for a son! You should have read that
review to know all my wonderful merits.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did, Roger. I heard Gibson speaking of it, and I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) get it
for me. I should have understood it better if they could have called
the animals by their English names, and not put so much of their
French jingo into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was an answer to an article by a French writer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>pleaded
Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd ha' let him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``We had to
beat 'em, and we did it at Waterloo; but I'd not demean myself by
answering any of their lies, if I was you. But I got through the
review, for all their Latin and French--I did; and if you doubt me,
you just look at the end of the great ledger, turn it upside down,
and you'll find I've copied out all the fine words they said of you:
`careful observer,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`strong nervous English,<div class="bookquote">'' `rising philosopher.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! I can nearly say it all off by heart, for many a time when I'm
frabbed by bad debts, or Osborne's bills, or moidered with accounts,
I turn the ledger wrong way up, and smoke a pipe over it, while I
read those pieces out of the review which speak about you, lad!''




<p/>CHAPTER XXXII.

<p/>COMING EVENTS.


<p/>Roger had turned over many plans in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thought
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could obtain sufficient money for the purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) desired to
accomplish. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) careful grandfather, who had been a merchant in the
city, had so tied up the few thousands he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) daughter,
that although, in case of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) death before her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband's, the latter
might enjoy the life-interest thereof, yet, in case of both their
deaths, their second son did not succeed to the property until he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
five-and-twenty; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) died before that age, the money that would
then have been his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cousins on the maternal side.
In short, the old merchant had taken as many precautions about his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)
legacy as if it had been for tens, instead of units of thousands. Of
course Roger might have slipped through all these meshes by insuring
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) life until the specified age; and, probably, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had consulted
any lawyer, this course would have been suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
disliked taking any one into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) confidence on the subject of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father's want of ready money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had obtained a copy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
grandfather's will at Doctors' Commons, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) imagined that all the
contingencies involved in it would be patent to the light of nature
and common sense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was a little mistaken in this, but not the less
resolved that money in some way he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would have in order to fulfil his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father, and for the ulterior purpose of giving the
squire some daily interest to distract his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thoughts from the regrets
and cares that were almost weakening his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind. It was <div class="bookquote">``Roger Hamley,
senior wrangler and Fellow of Trinity, to the highest bidder, no
matter what honest employment,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and presently it came down to <div class="bookquote">``any
bidder at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Another perplexity and distress at this time weighed upon Roger.
Osborne, heir to the estate, was going to have a child. The Hamley
property was entailed on <div class="bookquote">``heirs male born in lawful wedlock.''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>Was the
<div class="bookquote">``wedlock''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>lawful? Osborne never seemed to doubt that it was--never
seemed, in fact, to think twice about it. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), the husband, did
not, how much less did Aimée, the trustful wife? Yet who could tell
how much misery any shadows of illegality might cast into the future?
One evening Roger, sitting by the languid, careless, dilettante
Osborne, began to question him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as to the details of the marriage.
Osborne knew instinctively at what Roger was aiming. It was not that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not desire perfect legality in justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife; it was
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was so indisposed at the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hated to be bothered.
It was something like the refrain of Gray's Scandinavian Prophetess:
<div class="bookquote">``Leave me, leave me to repose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gray Prophetess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do try and tell me how you managed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How tiresome you are, Roger!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne</b></font>)</div>put in Osborne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I daresay I am. Go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've told you Morrison married us. You remember old Morrison at
Trinity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; as good and blunder-headed a fellow as ever lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s taken orders; and the examination for priest's orders
fatigued him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) father to give him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a hundred or
two for a tour on the Continent. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) meant to get to Rome, because he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
heard that there were such pleasant winters there. So he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) turned up at
Metz in August.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never was great in geography, you know; and
somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought that Metz, pronounced French fashion, must be on
the road to Rome. Some one had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Metz</b></font>) so in fun. However, it was
very well for me that I met with him (<font color='blue'><b>Metz</b></font>) there, for I was determined to
be married, and that without loss of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Aimée is a Catholic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true! but you see I am not. You don't suppose I would do her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
any wrong, Roger?''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>asked Osborne, sitting up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) lounging-chair,
and speaking rather indignantly to Roger, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face suddenly flushing
red.

<p/>``No! I'm sure you would not mean it; but, you see, there's a child
coming, and this estate is entailed on ``heirs-male.<div class="bookquote">'' Now, I want
to know if the marriage is legal or not? and it seems to me it's a
ticklish question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, falling back into repose, <div class="bookquote">``if that's all, I
suppose you're next heir-male, and I can trust you as I can myself.
You know my marriage is _bonâ fide_ in intention, and I believe
it to be legal in fact. We went over to Strasbourg; Aimée picked
up a friend--a good middle-aged Frenchwoman--who served half
as bridesmaid, half as chaperone, and then we went before the
mayor--préfet--what do you call them? I think Morrison rather enjoyed
the spree. I signed all manner of papers in the prefecture; I did not
read them over, for fear lest I could not sign them conscientiously.
It was the safest plan. Aimée kept trembling so I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>bridesmaid</b></font>) would
faint; and then we went off to the nearest English chaplaincy,
Carlsruhe, and the chaplain was away, so Morrison easily got the loan
of the chapel, and we were married the next day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely some registration or certificate was necessary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be married again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``and

marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay Morrison has got it somewhere. But I believe I'm legally
married according to the laws both of England and France; I really
do, old fellow. I've got the préfet's papers somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind! you shall be married again in England. Aimée goes to the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catholic</b></font>) is so good I wouldn't disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Catholic</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catholic</b></font>) religion for the

in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catholic</b></font>) lives as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a great deal of trouble, unnecessary trouble, and unnecessary
expense, I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``Why can't you leave well
alone? Neither Aimée nor I are of the sort of stuff to turn
scoundrels and deny the legality of our marriage; and if the child
is a boy and my father dies, and I die, why I'm sure you'll do him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
justice, as sure as I am of myself, old fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I die into the bargain? Make a hecatomb of the present
Hamleys all at once, while you are about it. Who succeeds as
heir-male?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne thought for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``One of the Irish Hamleys, I suppose.
I fancy they are needy chaps. Perhaps you're right. But what need to
have such gloomy forebodings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The law makes one have foresight in such affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger. <div class="bookquote">``So
I'll go down to Aimée next week when I'm in town, and I'll make all
necessary arrangements before you come. I think you'll be happier if
it is all done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be happier if I've a chance of seeing the little woman, that
I grant you. But what is taking you up to town? I wish I'd money to
run about like you, instead of being shut up for ever in this dull
old house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne was apt occasionally to contrast his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) position with Roger's
in a tone of complaint, forgetting that both were the results of
character, and also that out of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) income Roger gave up so large
a portion for the maintenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother's wife. But if this
ungenerous thought of Osborne's had been set clearly before his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
conscience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would have smote his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) breast and cried <div class="bookquote">``Mea culpa''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with
the best of them; it was only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was too indolent to keep an
unassisted conscience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have thought of going up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, reddening as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been accused of spending another's money instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own,
<div class="bookquote">``if I hadn't had to go up on business. Lord Hollingford has written
for me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) knows my great wish for employment, and has heard of
something which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) considers suitable; there's his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) letter if you care
to read it. But it does not tell anything definitely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne read the letter and returned it to Roger. After a moment or
two of silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``Why do you want money? Are we taking too
much from you? It's a great shame of me; but what can I do? Only
suggest a career for me, and I'll follow it to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke as
if Roger had been reproaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, don't get those notions into your head! I must
do something for myself sometimes, and I've been on the look-out.
Besides, I want my father to go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drainage; it would do
good both to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) health and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spirits. If I can advance any part of
the money requisite, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and you shall pay me interest until you can
return the capital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger, you're the providence of the family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Osborne,
suddenly struck by admiration at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother's conduct, and
forgetting to contrast it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own.

<p/>So Roger went up to London and Osborne followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and for two or
three weeks the Gibsons saw nothing of the brothers. But as wave
succeeds to wave, so interest succeeds to interest. <div class="bookquote">``The family,''
 (<font color='red'><b>visitors</b></font>)</div>as they were called, came down for their autumn sojourn at the
Towers, and again the house was full of visitors, and the Towers'
servants, and carriages, and liveries were seen in the two streets of
Hollingford, just as they might have been seen for scores of autumns
past.

<p/>So runs the round of life from day to day. Mrs. Gibson found the
chances of intercourse with the Towers rather more personally
exciting than Roger's visits, or the rarer calls of Osborne Hamley.
Cynthia had an old antipathy to the great family who had made so much
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother and so little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) considered as in
some measure the cause why she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had seen so little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother in
the days when the little girl had craved for love and found none.
Moreover, Cynthia missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) slave, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not care for
Roger one thousandth part of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had found
it not unpleasant to have a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thoroughly respected, and
whom men in general respected, the subject of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eye, the glad
ministrant to each scarce-spoken wish, a person in whose sight
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) words were pearls or diamonds, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) actions heavenly
graciousness, and in whose thoughts she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) reigned supreme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
no modest unconsciousness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was not vain.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) knew of all this worship; and when from circumstances she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) no
longer received it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) missed it. The Earl and the Countess, Lord
Hollingford and Lady Harriet, lords and ladies in general, liveries,
dresses, bags of game, and rumours of riding parties, were as nothing
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) compared to Roger's absence. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).
No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). Molly knew that Cynthia did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).
Molly grew angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) many and many a time as the conviction of
this fact was forced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Molly did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own feelings;
Roger had no overwhelming interest in what they might be; while his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
very life-breath seemed to depend on what Cynthia felt and thought.
Therefore Molly had keen insight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``sister's''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>heart; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
knew that Cynthia did not love Roger. Molly could have cried with
passionate regret at the thought of the unvalued treasure lying at
Cynthia's feet; and it would have been a merely unselfish regret.
It was the old fervid tenderness: <div class="bookquote">``Do not wish for the moon, O my
darling, for I cannot give it thee.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia's love was the moon
Roger yearned for; and Molly saw that it was far away and out of
reach, else would she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) have strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart-cords to give it to
Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would say to herself. ``That old bond is not
done away with, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is too much absorbed by Cynthia to speak
about it just now. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother called me <div class="bookquote">``Fanny;' it was almost like
an adoption. I must wait and watch, and see if I can do anything for
my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>One day Lady Harriet came to call on the Gibsons, or rather on Mrs.
Gibson, for the latter retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) old jealousy if any one else
in Hollingford was supposed to be on intimate terms at the great
house, or in the least acquainted with their plans. Mr. Gibson might
possibly know as much, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was professionally bound to
secrecy. Out of the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) considered Mr. Preston as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rival,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did so, and delighted in teasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) by
affecting a knowledge of family plans and details of affairs of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was ignorant. Indoors she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was jealous of the fancy Lady Harriet
had evidently taken for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) step-daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) contrived to place
quiet obstacles in the way of a too frequent intercourse between the
two. These obstacles were not unlike the shield of the knight in
the old story; only instead of the two sides presented to the two
travellers approaching it from opposite quarters, one of which was
silver, and one of which was gold, Lady Harriet saw the smooth and
shining yellow radiance, while poor Molly only perceived a dull and
heavy lead. To Lady Harriet it was ``Molly is gone out; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) will be so
sorry to miss you, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was obliged to go to see some old friends
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ought not to neglect; as I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
constancy is everything. It is Sterne, I think, who says, ``Thine own
and thy mother's friends forsake not.<div class="bookquote">'' But, dear Lady Harriet, you'll
stop till she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) comes home, won't you? I know how fond you are of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>);
in fact''  (<font color='red'><b>mother friends</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a little surface playfulness-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I sometimes say you
come more to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) than your poor old Clare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div><p/>To Molly it had previously been,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Harriet is coming here this morning. I can't have any one else
coming in. Tell Maria to say I'm not at home. Lady Harriet has always
so much to tell me. Dear Lady Harriet! I've known all her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) secrets
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was twelve years old. You two girls must keep out of the
way. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)'ll ask for you, out of common civility; but
you would only interrupt us if you came in, as you did the other
day;'' (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>--now addressing Molly--<div class="bookquote">``I hardly like to say so, but I thought
it was very forward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maria told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had asked for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>put in Molly, simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very forward indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Gibson, taking no further
notice of the interruption, except to strengthen the words to which
Molly's little speech had been intended as a correction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think this time I must secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship from the chances of
such an intrusion, by taking care that you are out of the house,
Molly. You had better go to the Holly Farm, and speak about those
damsons I ordered, and which have never been sent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``It's far too long a walk for Molly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s
had a bad cold, and isn't as strong as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was a fortnight ago. I
delight in long walks. If you want Molly out of the way, mamma, send
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to the Miss Brownings'--they are always glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said I wanted Molly out of the way, Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs.
Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``You always put things in such an exaggerated--I should
almost say, so coarse a manner. I am sure, Molly, my love, you
could never have so misunderstood me; it is only on Lady Harriet's
account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I can walk as far as the Holly Farm; papa would take
the message; Cynthia need not go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well! I'm the last person in the world to tax any one's strength;
I'd sooner never see damson preserve again. Suppose you do go and see
Miss Browning; you can pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) a nice long call, you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) likes
that; and ask after Miss Phoebe's cold from me, you know. They were
friends of your mother's, my dear, and I would not have you break off
old friendships for the world. <div class="bookquote">``Constancy above everything' is my
motto, as you know, and the memory of the dead ought always to be
cherished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mamma, where am I to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``Though Lady Harriet
doesn't care for me as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does for Molly--indeed, quite the
contrary I should say--yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might ask after me, and I had better
be safely out of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, meditatively, yet unconscious of any satire
in Cynthia's speech.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is much less likely to ask for you, my dear: I almost think
you might remain in the house, or you might go to the Holly Farm;
I really do want the damsons; or you might stay here in the
dining-room, you know, so as to be ready to arrange lunch prettily,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) does take a fancy to stay for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) is very fanciful,
is dear Lady Harriet! I would not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to think we made any
difference in our meals because she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) stayed. ``Simple elegance,<div class="bookquote">'' as I
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), `always is what we aim at.''  (<font color='red'><b>cook</b></font>)</div>But still you could put out the
best service, and arrange some flowers, and ask cook what there is
for dinner that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could send us for lunch, and make it all look
pretty, and impromptu, and natural. I think you had better stay at
home, Cynthia, and then you could fetch Molly from Miss Brownings' in
the afternoon, you know, and you two could take a walk together.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After Lady Harriet was fairly gone! I understand, mamma. Off with
you, Molly. Make haste, or Lady Harriet may come and ask for you as
well as mamma. I'll take care and forget where you are going to, so
that no one shall learn from me where you are, and I'll answer for
mamma's loss of memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Child! what nonsense you talk; you quite confuse me with being so
silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, fluttered and annoyed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usually was
with the Lilliputian darts Cynthia flung at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had recourse to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) accustomed feckless piece of retaliation--bestowing some favour
on Molly; and this did not hurt Cynthia one whit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, darling, there's a very cold wind, though it looks so fine.
You had better put on my Indian shawl; and it will look so pretty,
too, on your grey gown--scarlet and grey; it's not everybody I would
lend it to, but you're so careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) left Mrs. Gibson in careless
uncertainty as to whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) offer would be accepted or not.

<p/>Lady Harriet was sorry to miss Molly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was fond of the
girl; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) perfectly agreed with Mrs. Gibson's truism about
<div class="bookquote">``constancy''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``old friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) saw no occasion for saying any
more about the affair, but sat down in a little low chair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
feet on the fender. This said fender was made of bright, bright
steel, and was strictly tabooed to all household and plebeian feet;
indeed the position, if they assumed it, was considered low-bred and
vulgar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right, dear Lady Harriet! you can't think what a pleasure it
is to me to welcome you at my own fireside, into my humble home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humble! now, Clare, that's a little bit of nonsense, begging your
pardon. I don't call this pretty little drawing-room a bit of a
`humble home.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It's as full of comforts, and of pretty things too, as
any room of its size can be.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! how small you must feel it! even I had to reconcile myself to it
at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! perhaps your schoolroom was larger, but remember how bare it
was, how empty of anything but deal tables, and forms, and mats. Oh,
indeed, Clare, I quite agree with mamma, who always says you have
done very well for yourself; and Mr. Gibson too! What an agreeable,
well-informed man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife, slowly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not like to
relinquish her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rôle of a victim to circumstances quite immediately.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is very agreeable, very; only we see so little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); and of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) comes home tired and hungry, and not inclined to talk to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own family, and apt to go to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to have my turn now.
We've had the complaint of a doctor's wife, now hear the moans of a
peer's daughter. Our house is so overrun with visitors! and literally
to-day I have come to you for a little solitude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Solitude!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``Would you rather be alone?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>slightly aggrieved.

<p/>``No, you dear silly woman; my solitude requires a listener, to
whom I may say, ``How sweet is solitude!<div class="bookquote">'' But I am tired of the
responsibility of entertaining. Papa is so open-hearted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) asks
every friend he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) meets with to come and pay us a visit. Mamma is
really a great invalid, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does not choose to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
reputation for good health, having always considered illness a want
of self-control. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) gets wearied and worried by a crowd of people
who are all of them open-mouthed for amusement of some kind; just
like a brood of fledglings in a nest; so I have to be parent-bird,
and pop morsels into their yellow leathery bills, to find them
swallowed down before I can think of where to find the next. Oh, it's
`entertaining' in the largest, literalist, dreariest sense of the
word. So I have told a few lies this morning, and come off here for
quietness and the comfort of complaining!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Harriet threw herself back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) chair, and yawned; Mrs. Gibson
took one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ladyship's hands in a soft sympathizing manner, and
murmured,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Lady Harriet!''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) purred affectionately.

<p/>After a pause Lady Harriet started up and said--<div class="bookquote">``I used to take you
as my arbiter of morals when I was a little girl. Tell me, do you
think it wrong to tell lies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear! how can you ask such questions?--of course it is very
wrong,--very wicked indeed, I think I may say. But I know you were
only joking when you said you had told lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I wasn't. I told as plump fat lies as you would wish
to hear. I said I `was obliged to go into Hollingford on business,''
 (<font color='red'><b>visitors</b></font>)</div>when the truth was there was no obligation in the matter, only an
insupportable desire of being free from my visitors for an hour or
two, and my only business was to come here, and yawn, and complain,
and lounge at my leisure. I really think I'm unhappy at having told a
story, as children express it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Lady Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, a little puzzled as to
the exact meaning of the words that were trembling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) tongue, <div class="bookquote">``I

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>put in Lady Harriet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And besides, if you didn't, it was the fault of the tiresome people

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Harriet! I think you might have known me better; but I know you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. You must have told white lies, at any rate. How did you
feel after them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I should have been miserable if I ever had. I should have died of
self-reproach. ``The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the

so much that is unbending in my nature, and in our sphere of life
there are so few temptations. If we are humble, we are also simple,
and unshackled by etiquette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you blame me very much? If somebody else will blame me, I
sha'n't be so unhappy at what I said this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I never blamed you, not in my innermost heart, dear Lady
Harriet. Blame you, indeed! That would be presumption in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall set up a confessor! and it sha'n't be you, Clare,
for you have always been only too indulgent to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After a pause she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``Can you give me some lunch, Clare? I don't
mean to go home till three. My `business' will take me till then, as
the people at the Towers are duly informed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. I shall be delighted! but you know we are very simple in
our habits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I only want a little bread-and-butter, and perhaps a slice of
cold meat--you must not give yourself any trouble, Clare--perhaps you
dine now? let me sit down just like one of your family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you shall; I won't make any alteration;--it will be so pleasant
to have you sharing our family meal, dear Lady Harriet. But we dine
late, we only lunch now. How low the fire is getting; I really am
forgetting everything in the pleasure of this tête-à-tête!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) rang twice; with great distinctness, and with a long pause
between the rings. Maria brought in coals.

<p/>But the signal was as well understood by Cynthia as the <div class="bookquote">``Hall of
Apollo''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>was by the servants of Lucullus. The brace of partridges that
were to have been for the late dinner were instantly put down to the
fire; and the prettiest china brought out, and the table decked with
flowers and fruit, arranged with all Cynthia's usual dexterity and
taste. So that when the meal was announced, and Lady Harriet entered
the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not but think her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hostess's apologies had been
quite unnecessary; and be more and more convinced that Clare had
done very well for herself. Cynthia now joined the party, pretty
and elegant as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) always was; but somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not take Lady
Harriet's fancy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) only noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
mother's daughter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) presence made the conversation more general,
and Lady Harriet gave out several pieces of news, none of them of any
great importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), but as what had been talked about by the
circle of visitors assembled at the Towers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Hollingford ought to have been with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) said, amongst
other things; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) is obliged, or fancies himself obliged, which
is all the same thing, to stay in town about this Crichton legacy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A legacy? To Lord Hollingford? I am so glad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be in a hurry to be glad! It's nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) but trouble.
Didn't you hear of that rich eccentric Mr. Crichton, who died
some time ago, and--fired by the example of Lord Bridgewater,
I suppose--left a sum of money in the hands of trustees, of
whom my brother is one, to send out a man with a thousand fine
qualifications, to make a scientific voyage, with a view to bringing
back specimens of the fauna of distant lands, and so forming the
nucleus of a museum which is to be called the Crichton Museum, and so
perpetuate the founder's name. Such various forms does man's vanity
take! Sometimes it stimulates philanthropy; sometimes a love of
science!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me a very laudable and useful object, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Gibson, safely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay it is, taking it from the public-good view. But it's
rather tiresome to us privately, for it keeps Hollingford in town--or
between it and Cambridge--and each place as dull and empty as can be,
just when we want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down at the Towers. The thing ought to have
been decided long ago, and there's some danger of the legacy lapsing.
The two other trustees have run away to the Continent, feeling, as
they say, the utmost confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but in reality shirking their
responsibilities. However, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes it, so I ought not to
grumble. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is going to be very successful in the choice of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) man--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belongs to this county, too,--young Hamley of Hamley,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can only get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) college to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a Fellow of
Trinity, senior wrangler or something; and they're not so foolish as
to send their crack man to be eaten up by lions and tigers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be Roger Hamley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Cynthia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes brightening,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) cheeks flushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s not the eldest son; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) can scarcely be called Hamley of
Hamley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hollingford's man is a Fellow of Trinity, as I said before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is Mr. Roger Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia; <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s up in London
about some business! What news for Molly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) comes home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what has Molly to do with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Harriet. <div class="bookquote">``Is--?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) looked into Mrs. Gibson's face for an answer. Mrs. Gibson in
reply gave an intelligent and very expressive glance at Cynthia, who
however did not perceive it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! not at all,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>--and Mrs. Gibson nodded a little at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
daughter, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``If any one, that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Harriet began to look at the pretty Miss Kirkpatrick with fresh
interest; her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) brother had spoken in such a manner of this young
Mr. Hamley that every one connected with the phoenix was worthy of
observation. Then, as if the mention of Molly's name had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
afresh into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind, Lady Harriet said,--<div class="bookquote">``And where is Molly all
this time? I should like to see my little mentor. I hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is very
much grown since those days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) once gets gossiping with the Miss Brownings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) never
knows when to come home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Miss Brownings? Oh! I'm so glad you named them! I'm very fond of
them. Pecksy and Flapsy; I may call them so in Molly's absence. I'll
go and see them before I go home, and then perhaps I shall see my
dear little Molly too. Do you know, Clare, I've quite taken a fancy
to that girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>So Mrs. Gibson, after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) precautions, had to submit to Lady
Harriet's leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) half-an-hour earlier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) otherwise would
have done in order to <div class="bookquote">``make herself common''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as Mrs. Gibson expressed
it-RRB- by calling on the Miss Brownings.

<p/>But Molly had left before Lady Harriet arrived.

<p/>Molly went the long walk to the Holly Farm, to order the damsons,
out of a kind of penitence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had felt conscious of anger at being
sent out of the house by such a palpable manoeuvre as that which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother had employed. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not meet Cynthia, so
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went alone along the pretty lanes, with grassy sides and high
hedge-banks not at all in the style of modern agriculture. At first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) made herself uncomfortable with questioning herself as to how
far it was right to leave unnoticed the small domestic failings--the
webs, the distortions of truth which had prevailed in their household
ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) father's second marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) knew that very often
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) longed to protest, but did not do it, from the desire of sparing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) father any discord; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), too, was
occasionally aware of certain things that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pain, as showing
that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife's standard of conduct was not as high as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have
liked. It was a wonder to Molly whether this silence was right or
wrong. With a girl's want of toleration, and want of experience to
teach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the force of circumstances, and of temptation, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
often been on the point of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stepmother some forcible home
truths. But, possibly, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's example of silence, and often
some piece of kindness on Mrs. Gibson's part -LRB-for after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) way, and
when in a good temper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was very kind to Molly-RRB-, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
tongue.

<p/>That night at dinner, Mrs. Gibson recounted the conversation between
herself and Lady Harriet, giving it a very strong individual
colouring, as was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wont, and telling nearly the whole of what had
passed, although implying that there was a great deal said which was
so purely confidential, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was bound in honour not to repeat
it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) three auditors listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) without interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
much--indeed, without bestowing extreme attention on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
saying, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came to the fact of Lord Hollingford's absence in
London, and the reason for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger Hamley going off on a scientific expedition!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr.
Gibson, suddenly awakened into vivacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. At least it is not settled finally; but as Lord Hollingford
is the only trustee who takes any interest--and being Lord Cumnor's
son--it is next to certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I must have a voice in the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
relapsed into silence, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ears open, however, henceforward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long will he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) be away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``We shall miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) sadly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly's lips formed an acquiescing <div class="bookquote">``yes''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>to this remark, but no sound
was heard. There was a buzzing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ears as if the others were
going on with the conversation, but the words they uttered seemed
indistinct and blurred; they were merely conjectures, and did not
interfere with the one great piece of news. To the rest of the party
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) appeared to be eating her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dinner as usual, and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were
silent, there was one listener the more to Mrs. Gibson's stream of
prattle, and Mr. Gibson's and Cynthia's remarks.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII.

<p/>BRIGHTENING PROSPECTS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>It was a day or two afterwards, that Mr. Gibson made time to ride
round by Hamley, desirous to learn more exact particulars of this
scheme for Roger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could obtain from any extraneous source, and
rather puzzled to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should interfere in the project or
not. The state of the case was this:--Osborne's symptoms were, in Mr.
Gibson's opinion, signs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) having a fatal disease. Dr. Nicholls
had differed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) on this head, and Mr. Gibson knew that the old
physician had had long experience, and was considered very skilful
in the profession. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) himself was right, and,
if so, the complaint was one which might continue for years in the
same state as at present, or might end the young man's life in an
hour--a minute. Supposing that Mr. Gibson was right, would it be well
for Roger to be away where no sudden calls for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) presence could
reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)--away for two years? Yet if the affair was concluded, the
interference of a medical man might accelerate the very evil to be
feared; and after all, Dr. Nicholls might be right, and the symptoms
might proceed from some other cause. Might? Yes. Probably did? No.
Mr. Gibson could not bring himself to say <div class="bookquote">``yes''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>to this latter form
of sentence. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode on, meditating; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reins slack, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head
a little bent. It was one of those still and lovely autumn days
when the red and yellow leaves are hanging-pegs to dewy, brilliant
gossamer-webs; when the hedges are full of trailing brambles, loaded
with ripe blackberries; when the air is full of the farewell whistles
and pipes of birds, clear and short--not the long full-throated
warbles of spring; when the whirr of the partridge's wings is heard
in the stubble-fields, as the sharp hoof-blows fall on the paved
lanes; when here and there a leaf floats and flutters down to the
ground, although there is not a single breath of wind. The country
surgeon felt the beauty of the seasons perhaps more than most men.
He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) saw more of it by day, by night, in storm and sunshine, or in the
still, soft, cloudy weather. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) never spoke about what he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) felt on
the subject; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) did not put his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) feelings into words, even to
himself. But if his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) mood ever approached to the sentimental, it was
on such days as this. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) rode into the stable-yard, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) horse to
a man, and went into the house by a side entrance. In the passage he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
met the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's capital, Gibson! what good wind blew you here? You'll have
some lunch? it's on the table, I only just this minute left the
room.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) kept shaking Mr. Gibson's hand all the time till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), nothing loth, at the well-covered dining-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this I hear about Roger?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, plunging at once
into the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha! so you've heard, have you? It's famous, isn't it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s a boy to
be proud of, is old Roger. Steady Roger; we used to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) slow,
but it seems to me that slow and sure wins the race. But tell me;
what have you heard? how much is known? Nay, you must have a glass
full. It's old ale, such as we don't brew now-a-days; it's as old
as Osborne. We brewed it that autumn, and we called it the young
squire's ale. I thought to have tapped it on his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) marriage, but I
don't know when that will come to pass, so we've tapped it now in
Roger's honour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The old squire had evidently been enjoying the young squire's ale
to the verge of prudence. It was indeed as he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as strong as
brandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Gibson had to sip it very carefully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
cold roast beef.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! and what have you heard? There's a deal to hear, and all good
news, though I shall miss the lad, I know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know it was settled; I only heard that it was in
progress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it was only in progress, as you call it, till last Tuesday.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) never let me know anything about it, though; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) thought I
might be fidgety with thinking of the pros and cons. So I never knew
a word on't till I had a letter from my Lord Hollingford--where is
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pulling out a great black leathern receptacle for all manner of
papers. And putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) spectacles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) read aloud their headings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Measurement of timber, new railings,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>`drench for cows, from Farmer
Hayes,'' ``Dobson's accounts,<div class="bookquote">''--`um `um--here it is. Now read that
letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dobson</b></font>)</div>handing it to Mr. Gibson.

<p/>It was a manly, feeling, sensible letter, explaining to the old
father in very simple language the services which were demanded
by the terms of the will to which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and two or three others were
trustees; the liberal allowance for expenses, the still more liberal
reward for performance, which had tempted several men of considerable
renown to offer themselves as candidates for the appointment. Lord
Hollingford then went on to say that, having seen a good deal of
Roger lately, since the publication of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) article in reply to the
French osteologist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had had reason to think that in him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the
trustees would find united the various qualities required in a
greater measure than in any of the applicants who had at that time
presented themselves. Roger had deep interest in the subject; much
acquired knowledge, and at the same time, great natural powers of
comparison, and classification of facts; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had shown himself to be
an observer of a fine and accurate kind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was of the right age, in
the very prime of health and strength, and unshackled by any family
ties. Here Mr. Gibson paused for consideration. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hardly cared to
ascertain by what steps the result had been arrived at--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) already
knew what that result was; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind was again arrested as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eye
caught on the remuneration offered, which was indeed most liberal;
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) read with attention the high praise bestowed on the
son in this letter to the father. The Squire had been watching Mr.
Gibson--waiting till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came to this part--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hands
together as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! you've come to it at last. It's the best part of the whole,
isn't it? God bless the boy! and from a Whig, mind you, which makes
it the more handsome. And there's more to come still. I say, Gibson,
I think my luck is turning at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>passing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) on yet another
letter to read. <div class="bookquote">``That only came this morning; but I've acted on it
already, I sent for the foreman of the drainage works at once, I did;
and to-morrow, please God, they'll be at work again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson read the second letter, from Roger. To a certain degree
it was a modest repetition of what Lord Hollingford had said, with
an explanation of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had come to take so decided a step in life
without consulting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) did not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) to be in suspense
for one reason. Another was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) felt, as no one else could feel
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>), that by accepting this offer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) entered upon the kind of
life for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) knew himself to be most fitted. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) merged
the whole into business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) knew well the suffering his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>)
father had gone through when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had had to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) drainage works
for want of money; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>), Roger, had been enabled at once to raise
money upon the remuneration he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was to receive on the accomplishment
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) two years' work; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had also insured his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) life, in
order to provide for the repayment of the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had raised, in
case he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not live to return to England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said that the sum he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
had borrowed on this security would at once be forwarded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
father.

<p/>Mr. Gibson laid down the letter without speaking a word for some
time; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll have to pay a pretty sum for insuring his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
life beyond seas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s got his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Fellowship money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, a little depressed
at Mr. Gibson's remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that's true. And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s a strong young fellow, as I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could tell his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire in an under-tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems all settled now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, more in reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own
thoughts than to the Squire's remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire; <div class="bookquote">``and they're not going to let the grass grow
under his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s to be off as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) can get his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) scientific
traps ready. I almost wish he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wasn't to go. You don't seem quite to
like it, doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson in a more cheerful tone than before. <div class="bookquote">``It
can't be helped now without doing a mischief,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, Squire, I think it a great honour to have such a son. I envy
you, that's what I do. Here's a lad of three or four and twenty
distinguishing himself in more ways than one, and as simple and
affectionate at home as any fellow need to be--not a bit set up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s twice as much a son to me as Osborne, who has been all
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) life set up on nothing at all, as one may say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Squire, I mustn't hear anything against Osborne; we may praise
one, without hitting at the other. Osborne hasn't had the strong
health which has enabled Roger to work as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has done. I met a man
who knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tutor at Trinity the other day, and of course we began
cracking about Roger--it's not every day that one can reckon a senior
wrangler amongst one's friends, and I'm nearly as proud of the lad
as you are. This Mr. Mason told me the tutor said that only half of
Roger's success was owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mental powers; the other half was
owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) perfect health, which enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to work harder and
more continuously than most men without suffering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said that in
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) experience he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had never known any one with an equal capacity
for mental labour; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could come again with a fresh appetite
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) studies after shorter intervals of rest than most. Now I,
being a doctor, trace a good deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) superiority to the material
cause of a thoroughly good constitution, which Osborne hasn't got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne might have, if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) got out o' doors more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire,
moodily; <div class="bookquote">``but except when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) can loaf into Hollingford he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) doesn't
care to go out at all. I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) continued, with a glance of sudden
suspicion at Mr. Gibson, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s not after one of your girls? I don't
mean any offence, you know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'ll have the estate, and it won't
be free, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must marry money. I don't think I could allow it in
Roger; but Osborne's the eldest son, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson reddened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was offended for a moment. Then the partial
truth of what the Squire said was presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
remembered their old friendship, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) spoke quietly, if shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe there's anything of the kind going on. I'm not much
at home, you know; but I've never heard or seen anything that should
make me suppose that there is. When I do, I'll let you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Gibson, don't go and be offended. I'm glad for the boys to have
a pleasant house to go to, and I thank you and Mrs. Gibson for making
it pleasant. Only keep off love; it can come to no good. That's
all. I don't believe Osborne will ever earn a farthing to keep a
wife during my life, and if I were to die to-morrow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) would have
to bring some money to clear the estate. And if I do speak as I
shouldn't have done formerly--a little sharp or so--why, it's because
I've been worried by many a care no one knows anything of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to take offence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, <div class="bookquote">``but let us
understand each other clearly. If you don't want your sons to come
as much to my house as they do, tell them so yourself. I like the
lads, and am glad to see them; but if they do come, you must take the
consequences, whatever they are, and not blame me, or them either,
for what may happen from the frequent intercourse between two young
men and two young women; and what is more, though, as I said, I see
nothing whatever of the kind you fear at present, and have promised
to tell you of the first symptoms I do see, yet farther than that
I won't go. If there's an attachment at any future time, I won't
interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't so much mind if Roger fell in love with your Molly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
can fight for himself, you see, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s an uncommon nice girl. My
poor wife was so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>answered the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``It's Osborne and
the estate I'm thinking of!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) not to come near us. I shall be sorry, but you
will be safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll think about it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s difficult to manage. I've always to
get my blood well up before I can speak my mind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson was leaving the room, but at these words he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) turned and
laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand on the Squire's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take my advice, Squire. As I said, there's no harm done as yet, as
far as I know. Prevention is better than cure. Speak out, but speak
gently to Osborne, and do it at once. I shall understand how it is if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) doesn't show his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) face for some months in my house. If you speak
gently to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)'ll take the advice as from a friend. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) can
assure you there's no danger, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)'ll come just as usual,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>It was all very fine giving the Squire this good advice; but as
Osborne had already formed the very kind of marriage his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father most
deprecated, it did not act quite as well as Mr. Gibson had hoped. The
Squire began the conversation with unusual self-control; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grew
irritated when Osborne denied his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father's right to interfere in any
marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might contemplate; denied it with a certain degree of
doggedness and weariness of the subject that drove the Squire into
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) passions; and although, on after reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) remembered
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son's promise and solemn word not to think of either
Cynthia or Molly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife, yet the father and son had passed
through one of those altercations which help to estrange men for
life. Each had said bitter things to the other; and, if the brotherly
affection had not been so true between Osborne and Roger, they
too might have become alienated, in consequence of the Squire's
exaggerated and injudicious comparison of their characters and deeds.
But as Roger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) boyhood had loved Osborne too well to be jealous
of the praise and love which the eldest son, the beautiful brilliant
lad, had received, to the disparagement of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own plain awkwardness
and slowness, so now Osborne strove against any feeling of envy or
jealousy with all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might; but his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) efforts were conscious, Roger's
had been the simple consequence of affection, and the end to poor
Osborne was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) became moody and depressed in mind and body; but
both father and son concealed their feelings in Roger's presence.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came home just before sailing, busy and happy, the Squire
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) infectious energy, and Osborne looked up and was cheerful.

<p/>There was no time to be lost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was bound to a hot climate, and must
take all advantage possible of the winter months. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was to go first
to Paris, to have interviews with some of the scientific men there.
Some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) outfit, instruments, &c., were to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) to Havre,
from which port he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was to embark, after transacting his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) business in
Paris. The Squire learnt all his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) arrangements and plans, and even
tried in after-dinner conversations to penetrate into the questions
involved in the researches his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son was about to make. But Roger's
visit home could not be prolonged beyond two days.

<p/>The last day he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) rode into Hollingford earlier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) needed to have
done to catch the London coach, in order to bid the Gibsons good-by.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been too actively busy for some time to have leisure to bestow
much thought on Cynthia; but there was no need for fresh meditation
on that subject. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) image as a prize to be worked for, to be served
for seven years, and seven years more, was safe and sacred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
heart. It was very bad, this going away, and wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) good-by
for two long years; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wondered much during his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ride how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
should be justified in telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother, perhaps in telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own
sweet self, what his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) feelings were without expecting, nay, indeed
reprobating, any answer on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) part. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would know at any
rate how dearly she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was beloved by one who was absent; how in all
difficulties or dangers the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would be a polar star,
high up in the heavens, and so on, and so on; for with all a lover's
quickness of imagination and triteness of fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
a star, a flower, a nymph, a witch, an angel, or a mermaid, a
nightingale, a siren, as one or another of her (<font color='blue'><b>mermaid</b></font>) attributes rose up
before him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV.

<p/>A LOVER``S MISTAKE.


<p/>It was afternoon. Molly had gone out for a walk. Mrs. Gibson had been
paying some calls. Lazy Cynthia had declined accompanying either. A
daily walk was not a necessity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) as it was to Molly. On a lovely
day, or with an agreeable object, or when the fancy took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
could go as far as any one; but these were exceptional cases; in
general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was not disposed to disturb herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) in-door
occupations. Indeed, not one of the ladies would have left the house,
had they been aware that Roger was in the neighbourhood; for they
were aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was to come down but once before his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) departure,
and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) stay at home then would be but for a short time, and
they were all anxious to wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) good-by before his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) long absence.
But they had understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was not coming to the Hall until
the following week, and therefore they had felt themselves at full
liberty this afternoon to follow their own devices.

<p/>Molly chose a walk that had been a favourite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was a child. Something or other had happened just before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) left
home that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) begin wondering how far it was right for the sake
of domestic peace to pass over without comment the little deviations
from right that people perceive in those whom they live with. Or
whether, as they are placed in families for distinct purposes, not by
chance merely, there are not duties involved in this aspect of their
lot in life,--whether by continually passing over failings, their own
standard is not lowered,--the practical application of these thoughts
being a dismal sort of perplexity on Molly's part as to whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father was quite aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother's perpetual lapses from
truth; and whether his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blindness was wilful or not. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt
bitterly enough that although she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sure as could be that there
was no real estrangement between her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, yet there were
perpetual obstacles thrown in the way of their intercourse; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
thought with a sigh that if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would but come in with authority, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
might cut his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way clear to the old intimacy with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter, and
that they might have all the former walks and talks, and quips and
cranks, and glimpses of real confidence once again; things that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
stepmother did not value, yet which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), like the dog in the manger,
prevented Molly's enjoying. But after all Molly was a girl, not so
far removed from childhood; and in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) grave regrets
and perplexities, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eye was caught by the sight of some fine
ripe blackberries flourishing away high up on the hedge-bank among
scarlet hips and green and russet leaves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not care much for
blackberries herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had heard Cynthia say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) liked
them; and besides there was the charm of scrambling and gathering
them; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) forgot all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) troubles, and went climbing up the
banks, and clutching at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) almost inaccessible prizes, and slipping
down again triumphant, to carry them back to the large leaf which was
to serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as a basket. One or two of them she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tasted, but they
were as vapid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) palate as ever. The skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty print
gown was torn out of the gathers, and even with the fruit she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
eaten <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty lips with blackberries were all besmeared and
dyed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when having gathered as many and more than she (<font color='blue'><b>mermaid</b></font>) could possibly
carry, she (<font color='blue'><b>mermaid</b></font>) set off home, hoping to escape into her (<font color='blue'><b>mermaid</b></font>) room and mend her (<font color='blue'><b>mermaid</b></font>)
gown before it had offended Mrs. Gibson's neat eye. The front door
was easily opened from the outside, and Molly was out of the clear
light of the open air and in the shadow of the hall, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw a
face peep out of the dining-room before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) quite recognized whose it
was; and then Mrs. Gibson came softly out, sufficiently at least to
beckon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) into the room. When Molly had entered Mrs. Gibson closed
the door. Poor Molly expected a reprimand for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) torn gown and
untidy appearance, but was soon relieved by the expression of Mrs.
Gibson's face--mysterious and radiant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been watching for you, dear. Don't go upstairs into the
drawing-room, love. It might be a little interruption just now. Roger
Hamley is there with Cynthia; and I've reason to think--in fact I did
open the door unawares, but I shut it again softly, and I don't think
they heard me. Isn't it charming? Young love, you know, ah, how sweet
it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that Roger has proposed to Cynthia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly that. But I don't know; of course I know nothing. Only I
did hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had meant to leave England without speaking
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love, but that the temptation of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) alone had been too
great for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). It was symptomatic, was it not, my dear? And all I
wanted was to let it come to a crisis without interruption. So I've
been watching for you to prevent your going in and disturbing them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I may go to my own room, mayn't I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>pleaded Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, a little testily. <div class="bookquote">``Only I had expected
sympathy from you at such an interesting moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>But Molly did not hear these last words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had escaped upstairs,
and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) door. Instinctively she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) leaf full of
blackberries--what would blackberries be to Cynthia now? She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) felt
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could not understand it all; but as for that matter, what
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) understand? Nothing. For a few minutes her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) brain seemed
in too great a whirl to comprehend anything but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was being
carried on in earth's diurnal course, with rocks, and stones, and
trees, with as little volition on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) part as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) were dead.
Then the room grew stifling, and instinctively she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went to the open
casement window, and leant out, gasping for breath. Gradually the
consciousness of the soft peaceful landscape stole into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mind, and
stilled the buzzing confusion. There, bathed in the almost level rays
of the autumn sunlight, lay the landscape she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had known and loved
from childhood; as quiet, as full of low humming life as it had been
at this hour for many generations. The autumn flowers blazed out in
the garden below, the lazy cows were in the meadow beyond, chewing
their cud in the green aftermath; the evening fires had just been
made up in the cottages beyond, in preparation for the husband's
home-coming, and were sending up soft curls of blue smoke into the
still air; the children, let loose from school, were shouting merrily
in the distance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)-- Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heard nearer sounds; an
opened door, steps on the lower flight of stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not
have gone without even seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never, never would have done
so cruel a thing--never would have forgotten poor little Molly,
however happy he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might be! No! there were steps and voices, and the
drawing-room door was opened and shut once more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms that rested upon the window-sill, and cried,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had been so distrustful as to have let the idea enter her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could go without wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) good-by--her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), whom his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother had so
loved, and called by the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) little dead sister. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
thought of the tender love Mrs. Hamley had borne her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) cried the
more, for the vanishing of such love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) off the face of the
earth. Suddenly the drawing-room door opened, and some one was heard
coming upstairs; it was Cynthia's step. Molly hastily wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes,
and stood up and tried to look unconcerned; it was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had time
to do before Cynthia, after a little pause at the closed door, had
knocked; and on an answer being given, had said, without opening
the door,--<div class="bookquote">``Molly! Mr. Roger Hamley is here, and wants to wish you
good-by before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) goes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went downstairs again, as if
anxious just at that moment to avoid even so short a tête-à-tête with
Molly. With a gulp and a fit of resolution, as a child makes up its
mind to swallow a nauseous dose of medicine, Molly went instantly
downstairs.

<p/>Roger was talking earnestly to Mrs. Gibson in the bow of the window
when Molly entered; Cynthia was standing near, listening, but taking
no part in the conversation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes were downcast, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not
look up as Molly drew shyly near.

<p/>Roger was saying,--<div class="bookquote">``I could never forgive myself if I had accepted a
pledge from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shall be free until my return; but the hope, the
words, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sweet goodness, have made me happy beyond description. Oh,
Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>suddenly becoming aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) presence, and turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand in both of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``I think you have long guessed
my secret, have you not? I once thought of speaking to you before I
left, and confiding it all to you. But the temptation has been too
great,--I have told Cynthia how fondly I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), as far as words
can tell; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) says--''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) looked at Cynthia with passionate
delight, and seemed to forget in that gaze that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
sentence to Molly half finished.

<p/>Cynthia did not seem inclined to repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) saying, whatever it was,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother spoke for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sweet girl values your love as it ought to be valued, I am
sure. And I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>looking at Cynthia and Roger with intelligent
archness, <div class="bookquote">``I could tell tales as to the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) indisposition in
the spring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``you know it was no such thing. Pray
don't invent stories about me. I have engaged myself to Mr. Roger
Hamley, and that is enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough! more than enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger. <div class="bookquote">``I will not accept your
pledge. I am bound, but you are free. I like to feel bound, it makes
me happy and at peace, but with all the chances involved in the next
two years, you must not shackle yourself by promises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia did not speak at once; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was evidently revolving something
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own mind. Mrs. Gibson took up the word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very generous, I am sure. Perhaps it will be better not to
mention it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would much rather have it kept a secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia,
interrupting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, my dear love. That was just what I was going to say.
I once knew a young lady who heard of the death of a young man in
America, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had known pretty well; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) immediately said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had been engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and even went so far as to put on weeds; and
it was a false report, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came back well and merry, and declared
to everybody he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never so much as thought about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). So it was
very awkward for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). These things had much better be kept secret
until the proper time has come for divulging them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Even then and there Cynthia could not resist the temptation of
saying,--<div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I will promise you I won't put on weeds, whatever
reports come of Mr. Roger Hamley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger, please!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) put in, in a tender whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will all be witnesses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has professed to think of me,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is tempted afterwards to deny the fact. But at the same time I
wish it to be kept a secret until his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) return--and I am sure you will
all be so kind as to attend to my wish. Please, _Roger!_ Please,
Molly! Mamma, I must especially beg it of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger would have granted anything when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) by that name,
and in that tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand in silent pledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) reply.
Molly felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could never bring herself to name the affair
as a common piece of news. So it was only Mrs. Gibson that answered
aloud,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child! why `especially' to poor me? You know I'm the most
trustworthy person alive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>The little pendule on the chimney-piece struck the half-hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, in dismay. <div class="bookquote">``I had no idea it was so late. I
shall write from Paris. The coach will be at the George by this time,
and will only stay five minutes. Dearest Cynthia--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand,
and then, as if the temptation was irresistible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Only remember you are free!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) released
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) and passed on to Mrs. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had considered myself free,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, blushing a little,
but ready with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) repartee to the last,--<div class="bookquote">``if I had thought myself
free, do you think I would have allowed that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Molly's turn came, and the old brotherly tenderness came back
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) look, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) bearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly! you won't forget me, I know; I shall never forget you, nor
your goodness to--her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice began to quiver, and it was best
to be gone. Mrs. Gibson was pouring out, unheard and unheeded, words
of farewell; Cynthia was re-arranging some flowers in a vase on the
table, the defects in which had caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) artistic eye, without
the consciousness penetrating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mind. Molly stood, numb to the
heart; neither glad nor sorry, nor anything but stunned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt the
slackened touch of the warm grasping hand; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked up--for till
now her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes had been downcast, as if there were heavy weights to
their lids--and the place was empty where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had been; his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) quick
step was heard on the stair, the front door was opened and shut;
and then as quick as lightning Molly ran up to the front attic--the
lumber-room, whose window commanded the street down which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
must pass. The window-clasp was unused and stiff, Molly tugged at
it--unless it was open, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head put out, that last chance would
be gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) again; I must! I must!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wailed out, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was
pulling. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was, running hard to catch the London coach; his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
luggage had been left at the George before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) came up to wish the
Gibsons good-by. In all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hurry, Molly saw him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turn round and shade
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes from the level rays of the westering sun, and rake the house
with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) glances--in hopes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew, of catching one more glimpse of
Cynthia. But apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw no one, not even Molly at the attic
casement; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had drawn back when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had turned, and kept herself
in shadow; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had no right to put herself forward as the one to
watch and yearn for farewell signs. None came--another moment--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was
out of sight for years!


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: THE LAST TURNING.-RSB-


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shut the window softly, and shivered all over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) left the attic
and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own room; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not begin to take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
out-of-door things till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard Cynthia's foot on the stairs.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hastily went to the toilet-table, and began to untie her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
bonnet-strings; but they were in a knot, and took time to undo.
Cynthia's step stopped at Molly's door; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) opened it a little and
said,--<div class="bookquote">``May I come in, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, longing to be able to say <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>all the time.
Molly did not turn to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), so Cynthia came up behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), and
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) two hands round Molly's waist, peeped over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shoulder,
putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lips to be kissed. Molly could not resist the
action--the mute entreaty for a caress. But, in the moment before,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had caught the reflection of the two faces in the glass; her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
own, red-eyed, pale, with lips dyed with blackberry juice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) curls
tangled, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bonnet pulled awry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gown torn--and contrasted it
with Cynthia's brightness and bloom, and the trim elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
dress. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! it is no wonder!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>thought poor Molly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) turned
round, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms round Cynthia, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head for an
instant on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) shoulder--the weary, aching head that sought a loving
pillow in that supreme moment! The next she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had raised herself, and
taken Cynthia's two hands, and was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) off a little, the
better to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) face.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``OH! IT IS NO WONDER!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia! you do love him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dearly, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia winced a little aside from the penetrating steadiness of
those eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak with all the solemnity of an adjuration, Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>),
laughing a little at first to cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) nervousness, and then looking
up at Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think I've given a proof of it? But you know
I've often told you I've not the gift of loving; I said pretty much
the same thing to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). I can respect, and I fancy I can admire, and
I can like, but I never feel carried off my feet by love for any one,
not even for you, little Molly, and I'm sure I love you more than--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand before Cynthia's mouth, in
almost a passion of impatience. <div class="bookquote">``Don't, don't--I won't hear you--I
ought not to have asked you--it makes you tell lies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) turn seeking to read Molly's
face, <div class="bookquote">``what's the matter with you? One might think you cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, all the blood rushing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart suddenly; then it
returned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had courage to speak, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke the truth as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) believed it, though not the real actual truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); I think you have won the love of a prince amongst
men. Why, I am proud to remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) has been to me as a brother,
and I love him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) as a sister, and I love you doubly because he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) has
honoured you with his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, that's not complimentary!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, laughing, but
not ill-pleased to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) lover's praises, and even willing to
depreciate him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) a little in order to hear more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)'s well enough, I daresay, and a great deal too learned and clever
for a stupid girl like me; but even you must acknowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)'s very
plain and awkward; and I like pretty things and pretty people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia, I won't talk to you about him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>). You know you don't mean what
you are saying, and you only say it out of contradiction, because I
praise him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) shan't be run down by you, even in joke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, we won't talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) at all. I was so surprised when
he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) began to speak--so--''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>and Cynthia looked very lovely, blushing
and dimpling up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) words and looks. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
recalled herself to the present time, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eye caught on the leaf
full of blackberries--the broad, green leaf, so fresh and crisp when
Molly had gathered it an hour or so ago, but now soft and flabby, and
dying. Molly saw it, too, and felt a strange kind of sympathetic pity
for the poor inanimate leaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! what blackberries! you've gathered them for me, I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said
Cynthia, sitting down and beginning to feed herself daintily,
touching them lightly with the ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) taper fingers, and
dropping each ripe berry into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) open mouth. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had eaten
about half she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stopped suddenly short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I should like to have gone as far as Paris with him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it wouldn't have been proper; but how pleasant
it would have been! I remember at Boulogne''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-another blackberry-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``how I used to envy the English who were going to Paris; it seemed
to me then as if nobody stopped at Boulogne, but dull, stupid
school-girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When will he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) be there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On Wednesday, he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) said. I'm to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) there; at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)'s
going to write to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly went about the adjustment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dress in a quiet,
business-like manner, not speaking much; Cynthia, although sitting
still, seemed very restless. Oh! how much Molly wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would
go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, after a pause of apparent
meditation, <div class="bookquote">``we shall never be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you say that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, almost bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``You have nothing
to make you think so. I wonder how you can bear to think you won't,
even for a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia; <div class="bookquote">``you mustn't go and take me _au grand sérieux_. I
daresay I don't mean what I say, but you see everything seems a dream
at present. Still, I think the chances are equal--the chances for and
against our marriage, I mean. Two years! it's a long time! he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) may
change his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mind, or I may; or some one else may turn up, and I may
get engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>): what should you think of that, Molly? I'm putting
such a gloomy thing as death quite on one side, you see; yet in two
years how much may happen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk so, Cynthia, please don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, piteously. <div class="bookquote">``One
would think you didn't care for him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) cares so much for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, did I say I didn't care for him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)? I was only calculating
chances. I'm sure I hope nothing will happen to prevent the marriage.
Only, you know it may, and I thought I was taking a step in wisdom,
in looking forward to all the evils that might befall. I'm sure all
the wise people I've ever known thought it a virtue to have gloomy
prognostics of the future. But you're not in a mood for wisdom or
virtue, I see; so I'll go and get ready for dinner, and leave you to
your vanities of dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took Molly's face in both her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands, before Molly was aware
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) intention, and kissed it playfully. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) left Molly to
herself.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXV.

<p/>THE MOTHER``S MANOEUVRE.


<p/>Mr. Gibson was not at home at dinner--detained by some patient, most
probably. This was not an unusual occurrence; but it _was_ rather an
unusual occurrence for Mrs. Gibson to go down into the dining-room,
and sit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) deferred meal when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came in an hour
or two later. In general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) easy-chair, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) corner
of the sofa, upstairs in the drawing-room, though it was very rarely
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would allow Molly to avail herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother's
neglected privilege. Molly would fain have gone down and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father company every night that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had these solitary meals; but for
peace and quietness she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own wishes on the matter.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson took a seat by the fire in the dining-room, and patiently
waited for the auspicious moment when Mr. Gibson, having satisfied
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) healthy appetite, turned from the table, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) place by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) got up, and with unaccustomed attention moved the wine
and glasses so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could help himself without moving from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, now! are you comfortable? for I have a great piece of news to
tell you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), when all was arranged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought there was something on hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Now for
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger Hamley has been here this afternoon to bid us good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by! Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) gone? I didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was going so soon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Mr. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: never mind, that's not it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But tell me; has he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) left this neighbourhood? I wanted to have seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) left love and regret, and all that sort of thing
for you. Now let me get on with my story: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) found Cynthia alone,
proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), and was accepted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia? Roger proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr.
Gibson, slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure. Why not? you speak as if it was something so very
surprising.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I? But I am surprised. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s a very fine young fellow, and I
wish Cynthia joy; but do you like it? It will have to be a very long
engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), in a knowing manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will be away for two years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A great deal may happen in two years,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will have to run many risks, and go into many dangers, and
will come back no nearer to the power of maintaining a wife than when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) replied, still in the arch manner of one
possessing superior knowledge. <div class="bookquote">``A little bird did tell me that
Osborne's life is not so very secure; and then--what will Roger be?
Heir to the estate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you that about Osborne?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), facing round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
and frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sudden sternness of voice and manner.
It seemed as if absolute fire came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) long dark sombre eyes.
<div class="bookquote">''_Who_ told you, I say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made a faint rally back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) former playfulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? can you deny it? Is it not the truth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask you again, Hyacinth, who told you that Osborne Hamley's life
is in more danger than mine--or yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't speak in that frightening way. My life is not in danger,
I'm sure; nor yours either, love, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) gave an impatient movement, and knocked a wine-glass off the
table. For the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt grateful for the diversion, and
busied herself in picking up the fragments: <div class="bookquote">``bits of glass were so
dangerous,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was startled by a voice of command,
such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had never yet heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind the glass. I ask you again, Hyacinth, who told you
anything about Osborne Hamley's state of health?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I wish no harm to him (<font color='blue'><b>yours</b></font>), and I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>yours</b></font>) is in very good
health, as you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>whispered she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told--?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>began he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again, sterner than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you will know, and will make such a fuss about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), driven to extremity, <div class="bookquote">``it was you yourself--you or Dr. Nicholls,
I am sure I forget which.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never spoke to you on the subject, and I don't believe Nicholls
did. You'd better tell me at once what you're alluding to, for I'm
resolved I'll have it out before we leave this room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd never married again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, now fairly crying, and
looking round the room, as if in vain search for a mouse-hole in
which to hide herself. Then, as if the sight of the door into the
store-room gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) courage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) turned and faced him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not talk your medical secrets so loud then, if you don't
want people to hear them. I had to go into the store-room that day
Dr. Nicholls was here; cook wanted a jar of preserve, and stopped me
just as I was going out--I am sure it was for no pleasure of mine,
for I was sadly afraid of stickying my gloves--it was all that you
might have a comfortable dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was going to cry again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gravely motioned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to go on, merely saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! you overheard our conversation, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) answered eagerly, almost relieved by being thus
helped out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) forced confession. <div class="bookquote">``Only a sentence or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were they?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked.

<p/>``Why, you had just been saying something, and Dr. Nicholls said, <div class="bookquote">``If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) has got aneurism of the aorta his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) days are numbered.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well. Anything more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes; you said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope to God I may be mistaken; but there is a
pretty clear indication of symptoms, in my opinion.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know we were speaking of Osborne Hamley?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked;
perhaps in hopes of throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) off the scent. But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was descending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) level of subterfuge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took
courage, and said in quite a different tone to the cowed one which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been using:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I know. I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) name mentioned by you both before I began to
listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you own you did listen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), hesitating a little now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray how do you come to remember so exactly the name of the
disease spoken of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I went--now don't be angry, I really can't see any harm in
what I did--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, don't deprecate anger. You went--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Into the surgery, and looked it out. Why might not I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson did not answer--did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face was very
pale, and both forehead and lips were contracted. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) roused
himself, sighed, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! I suppose as one brews one must bake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>pouted she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that it was what you heard on
that occasion that made you change your behaviour to Roger Hamley?
I've noticed how much more civil you were to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) of late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean that I have ever got to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) as much as Osborne,
you are very much mistaken; no, not even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has offered to
Cynthia, and is to be my son-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me know the whole affair. You overheard,--I will own that it was
Osborne about whom we were speaking, though I shall have something to
say about that presently--and then, if I understand you rightly, you
changed your behaviour to Roger, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) more welcome to this
house than you had ever done before, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as proximate heir
to the Hamley estates?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by `proximate.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go into the surgery, and look into the dictionary, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>),
losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) temper for the first time during the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) through sobs and tears, ``that Roger had taken
a fancy to Cynthia; any one might see that; and as long as Roger
was only a younger son, with no profession, and nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
fellowship, I thought it right to discourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), as any one would
who had a grain of common sense in them; for a clumsier, more common,
awkward, stupid fellow I never saw--to be called ``county,<div class="bookquote">'' I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care; you'll have to eat your words presently when you come to
fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll have Hamley some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), not perceiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) exact drift. <div class="bookquote">``You are
vexed now because it is not Molly he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s in love with; and I call it
very unjust and unfair to my poor fatherless girl. I am sure I have
always tried to further Molly's interests as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was my own
daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson was too indifferent to this accusation to take any notice
of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) returned to what was of far more importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The point I want to be clear about is this. Did you or did you not
alter your behaviour to Roger in consequence of what you overheard of
my professional conversation with Dr. Nicholls? Have you not favoured
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) suit to Cynthia since then, on the understanding gathered from
that conversation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) stood a good chance of inheriting Hamley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), sulkily. <div class="bookquote">``And if I did, I can't
see any harm in it, that I should be questioned as if I were
in a witness-box. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) was in love with Cynthia long before that
conversation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) so much. It was not for me to cross
the path of true love. I don't see how you would have a mother show
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may not turn accidental circumstances
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) advantage. Perhaps Cynthia might have died if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had been
crossed in love; her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) poor father was consumptive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know that all professional conversations are confidential?
That it would be the most dishonourable thing possible for me to
betray secrets which I learn in the exercise of my profession?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course, you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! and are not you and I one in all these respects? You cannot do
a dishonourable act without my being inculpated in the disgrace. If
it would be a deep disgrace for me to betray a professional secret,
what would it be for me to trade on that knowledge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was trying hard to be patient; but the offence was of that class
which galled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) insupportably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by trading. Trading in a daughter's
affections is the last thing I should do; and I should have thought
you would be rather glad than otherwise to get Cynthia well married,
and off your hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson got up, and walked about the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
pockets. Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) began to speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stopped impatiently
short without going on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said at length. <div class="bookquote">``You either
can't or won't see what I mean. I'm glad enough to have Cynthia here.
I have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) a true welcome, and I sincerely hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) will find
this house as much a home as my own daughter does. But for the future
I must look out of my doors, and double-lock the approaches if I am
so foolish as to-- However, that's past and gone; and it remains with
me to prevent its recurrence as far as I can for the future. Now let
us hear the present state of affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I ought to tell you anything about it. It is a secret,
just as much as your mysteries are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; you have told me enough for me to act upon, which I
most certainly shall do. It was only the other day I promised the
Squire to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) know if I suspected anything--any love affair, or
entanglement, much less an engagement, between either of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sons and
our girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this is not an engagement; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would not let it be so; if you
would only listen to me, I could tell you all. Only I do hope you
won't go and tell the Squire and everybody. Cynthia did so beg that
it might not be known. It is only my unfortunate frankness that has
led me into this scrape. I never could keep a secret from those whom
I love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must tell the Squire. I shall not mention it to any one else. And
do you quite think it was consistent with your general frankness to
have overheard what you did, and never to have mentioned it to me?
I could have told you then that Dr. Nicholls' opinion was decidedly
opposed to mine, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) believed that the disturbance about
which I consulted him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) on Osborne's behalf was merely temporary. Dr.
Nicholls would tell you that Osborne is as likely as any man to live
and marry and beget children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>If there was any skill used by Mr. Gibson so to word this speech
as to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own opinion, Mrs. Gibson was not sharp enough to
find it out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was dismayed, and Mr. Gibson enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) dismay; it
restored him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to something like his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usual frame of mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us review this misfortune, for I see you consider it as such,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not quite a misfortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But, certainly, if I had
known Dr. Nicholls' opinion--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see the advantage of always consulting me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) continued
gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Here is Cynthia engaged--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not engaged, I told you before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) would not allow it to be
considered an engagement on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, entangled in a love-affair with a lad of three-and-twenty,
with nothing beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fellowship and a chance of inheriting an
encumbered estate; no profession even, abroad for two years, and
I must go and tell his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father all about it to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear! Pray say that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) dislikes it, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has only to express
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you can act without Cynthia in the affair. And if I am
not mistaken, Cynthia will have a pretty stout will of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own on the
subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cares for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) very much; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is not one to be
always falling in love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) does not take things very deeply to
heart. But, of course, one would not do anything abruptly; two years'
absence gives one plenty of time to turn oneself in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But a little while ago we were threatened with consumption and an
early death if Cynthia's affections were thwarted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you dear creature, how you remember all my silly words! It might
be, you know. Poor dear Mr. Kirkpatrick was consumptive, and Cynthia
may have inherited it, and a great sorrow might bring out the latent
seeds. At times I am so fearful. But I daresay it is not probable,
for I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) takes things very deeply to heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'm quite at liberty to give up the affair, acting as Cynthia's
proxy, if the Squire disapproves of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Mrs. Gibson was in a strait at this question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``We cannot give it up. I am sure Cynthia
would not; especially if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thought others were acting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) really is very much in love. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) were in Osborne's place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you what I should do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, in real
earnest. <div class="bookquote">``However it may have been brought about, here are two young
people in love with each other. One is as fine a young fellow as ever
breathed; the other a very pretty, lively, agreeable girl. The father
of the young man must be told, and it is most likely he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will bluster
and oppose; for there is no doubt it is an imprudent affair as far as
money goes. But let them be steady and patient, and a better lot need
await no young woman. I only wish it were Molly's good fortune to
meet with such another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); I will indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, relieved by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) change of tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't. That's one thing I forbid. I'll have no `trying' for
Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't be angry, dear! Do you know I was quite afraid you were
going to lose your temper at one time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been of no use!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), gloomily, getting up as if
to close the sitting. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife was only too glad to make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) escape.
The conjugal interview had not been satisfactory to either. Mr.
Gibson had been compelled to face and acknowledge the fact, that the
wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had chosen had a very different standard of conduct from
that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had upheld all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) life, and had hoped to have seen
inculcated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was more irritated than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) chose to
show; for there was so much of self-reproach in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) irritation that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) kept it to himself, brooded over it, and allowed a feeling of
suspicious dissatisfaction with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife to grow up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind,
which extended itself by-and-by to the innocent Cynthia, and
caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) manner to both mother and daughter to assume a certain
curt severity, which took the latter at any rate with extreme
surprise. But on the present occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife up to the
drawing-room, and gravely congratulated the astonished Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has mamma told you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), shooting an indignant glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
mother. <div class="bookquote">``It is hardly an engagement; and we all pledged ourselves to
keep it a secret, mamma among the rest!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dearest Cynthia, you could not expect--you could not have
wished me to keep a secret from my husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>pleaded Mrs. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, perhaps not. At any rate, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, turning towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with graceful frankness, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad you should know it. You have
always been a most kind friend to me, and I daresay I should have
told you myself, but I did not want it named; if you please, it must
still be a secret. In fact, it is hardly an engagement--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
blushed and sparkled a little at the euphuism, which implied that
there was but one <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>present in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thoughts at the moment-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``would
not allow me to bind myself by any promise until his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) return!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson looked gravely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), irresponsive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) winning looks,
which at the moment reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) too forcibly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother's ways.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand, and said, seriously enough,--<div class="bookquote">``I hope you are
worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), Cynthia, for you have indeed drawn a prize. I have
never known a truer or warmer heart than Roger's; and I have known
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) boy and man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could have thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father aloud for this
testimony to the value of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) who was gone away. But Cynthia pouted a
little before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) smiled up in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not complimentary, are you, Mr. Gibson?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
thinks me worthy, I suppose; and if you have so high an opinion
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), you ought to respect his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) judgment of me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hoped to
provoke a compliment she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was disappointed, for Mr. Gibson let go her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
hand in an absent manner, and sate down in an easy chair by the fire,
gazing at the wood embers as if hoping to read the future in them.
Molly saw Cynthia's eyes fill with tears, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to the
other end of the room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had gone to seek some working
materials.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand while
trying to assist in the search.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Molly, I am so fond of your father; what makes him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speak so to
me to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>They were recalled from further conversation by Mr. Gibson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
roused himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reverie, and was now addressing Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will not consider it a breach of confidence, Cynthia, but
I must tell the Squire of--of what has taken place to-day between
you and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son. I have bound myself by a promise to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was
afraid--it's as well to tell you the truth--he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was afraid''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-an

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia looked extremely annoyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was the one thing I stipulated for--secrecy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``I can understand your not wishing to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia; <div class="bookquote">``I would not have had any one know if I

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm almost certain Roger will tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia; <div class="bookquote">``I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) promise, and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is

herself in disgrace with both husband and child, was keeping a

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, at any rate, the story would come with so much better a grace

Hall till the end of the week; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) may have written and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
father before then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia held her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tongue for a little while. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said, with
tearful pettishness,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man's promise is to override a woman's wish, then, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see any reason why it should not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you trust in my reasons when I tell you it will cause me
a great deal of distress if it gets known?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said this in so
pleading a voice, that if Mr. Gibson had not been thoroughly
displeased and annoyed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) previous conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) must have yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said, coldly,--<div class="bookquote">``Telling
Roger's father is not making it public. I don't like this exaggerated
desire for such secrecy, Cynthia. It seems to me as if something more
than is apparent was concealed behind it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, suddenly; <div class="bookquote">``let us sing that duet I've
been teaching you; it's better than talking as we are doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a little lively French duet. Molly sang it carelessly, with
heaviness at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart; but Cynthia sang it with spirit and apparent
merriment; only she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) broke down in hysterics at last, and flew
upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own room. Molly, heeding nothing else--neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father nor Mrs. Gibson's words--followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and found the door of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bedroom locked, and for all reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) entreaties to be allowed
to come in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard Cynthia sobbing and crying.

<p/>It was more than a week after the incidents just recorded before
Mr. Gibson found himself at liberty to call on the Squire; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
heartily hoped that long before then, Roger's letter might have
arrived from Paris, telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father the whole story. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) saw at
the first glance that the Squire had heard nothing unusual to disturb
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) equanimity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was looking better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had done for months
past; the light of hope was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) face seemed of a healthy
ruddy colour, gained partly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) resumption of outdoor employment
in the superintendence of the works, and partly because the happiness
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had lately had through Roger's means, caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) blood to flow
with regular vigour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had felt Roger's going away, it is true; but
whenever the sorrow of parting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pressed too heavily upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pipe, and smoked it out over a long, slow, deliberate,
re-perusal of Lord Hollingford's letter, every word of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) knew
by heart; but expressions in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) made a pretence to himself
of doubting, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) might have an excuse for looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) son's
praises once again. The first greetings over, Mr. Gibson plunged into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any news from Roger yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; here's his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, producing his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) black
leather case, in which Roger's missive had been placed along with the
other very heterogeneous contents.

<p/>Mr. Gibson read it, hardly seeing the words after he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had by one rapid
glance assured himself that there was no mention of Cynthia in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum! I see he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) doesn't name one very important event that has
befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) left you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, seizing on the
first words that came. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I'm committing a breach of
confidence on one side; but I'm going to keep the promise I made
the last time I was here. I find there is something--something
of the kind you apprehended--you understand--between him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and my
step-daughter, Cynthia Kirkpatrick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) called at our house to wish
us good-by, while waiting for the London coach, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) alone, and
spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>). They don't call it an engagement, but of course it is
one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me back the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, in a constrained kind of
voice. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) read it again, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had not previously mastered
its contents, and as if there might be some sentence or sentences he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
had overlooked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said at last, with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) tells me nothing about it.
Lads may play at confidences with their fathers, but they keep a deal
back.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div>The Squire appeared more disappointed at not having heard of
this straight from Roger than displeased at the fact itself, Mr.
Gibson thought. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)'s not the eldest son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>continued the Squire, talking as it
were to himself. <div class="bookquote">``But it's not the match I should have planned
for him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>). How came you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), firing round on Mr. Gibson,
suddenly--<div class="bookquote">``to say when you were last here, that there was nothing
between my sons and either of your girls? Why, this must have been
going on all the time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it was. But I was as ignorant about it as the babe
unborn. I only heard of it on the evening of the day of Roger's
departure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's a week ago, sir. What's kept you quiet ever since?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that Roger would tell you himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That shows you've no sons. More than half their life is unknown to
their fathers. Why, Osborne there, we live together--that's to say,
we have our meals together, and we sleep under the same roof--and
yet--Well! well! life is as God has made it. You say it's not an
engagement yet? But I wonder what I'm doing? Hoping for my lad's
disappointment in the folly he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s set his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) heart on--and just when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s
been helping me. Is it a folly, or is it not? I ask you, Gibson, for
you must know this girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hasn't much money, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About thirty pounds a year, at my pleasure during her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mother's
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whew! It's well he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s not Osborne. They'll have to wait. What family
is she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) of? None of 'em in trade, I reckon, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) being so poor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) father was grandson of a certain Sir Gerald
Kirkpatrick. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) mother tells me it is an old baronetcy. I know
nothing of such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's something. I do know something of such things, as you are
pleased to call them. I like honourable blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson could not help saying, <div class="bookquote">``But I'm afraid that only
one-eighth of Cynthia's blood is honourable; I know nothing further
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) relations excepting the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) father was a curate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Professional. That's a step above trade at any rate. How old is
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighteen or nineteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so; most people do; but it's all a matter of taste.
Come, Squire, judge for yourself. Ride over and take lunch with us
any day you like. I may not be in; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother will be there, and
you can make acquaintance with your son's future wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was going too fast, however; presuming too much on the quietness
with which the Squire had been questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). Mr. Hamley drew back
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) shell, and spoke in a surly manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) replied,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger's `future wife!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'ll be wiser by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) comes home. Two
years among the black folk will have put more sense in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Possible, but not probable, I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Gibson.
<div class="bookquote">``Black folk are not remarkable for their powers of reasoning, I
believe, so that they haven't much chance of altering his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) opinion
by argument, even if they understood each other's language; and
certainly if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) shares my taste, their peculiarity of complexion will
only make him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) appreciate white skins the more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you said it was no engagement,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>growled the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
thinks better of it, you won't keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to it, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wishes to break it off, I shall certainly advise Cynthia to
be equally willing, that's all I can say. And I see no reason for
discussing the affair further at present. I've told you how matters
stand because I promised you I would, if I saw anything of this kind
going on. But in the present condition of things, we can neither make
nor mar; we can only wait.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hat to go. But the
Squire was discontented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go, Gibson. Don't take offence at what I've said, though I'm
sure I don't know why you should. What's the girl like in herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did; only he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
was vexed, and did not choose to understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--well, is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) like your Molly?--sweet-tempered and
sensible--with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gloves always mended, and neat about the feet, and
ready to do anything one asks her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) just as if doing it was the very
thing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liked best in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson's face relaxed now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could understand all the
Squire's broken sentences and unexplained meanings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is much prettier than Molly to begin with, and has very winning
ways. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s always well-dressed and smart-looking, and I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
hasn't much to spend on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) clothes, and always does what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s asked
to do, and is ready enough with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty, lively answers. I don't
think I ever saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) out of temper; but then I'm not sure if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
takes things keenly to heart, and a certain obtuseness of feeling
goes a great way towards a character for good temper, I've observed.
Altogether I think Cynthia is one in a hundred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire meditated a little. <div class="bookquote">``Your Molly is one in a thousand, to
my mind. But then, you see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) comes of no family at all,--and I
don't suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'ll have a chance of much money.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) were thinking aloud, and without reference to Mr. Gibson, but it
nettled the latter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) replied somewhat impatiently,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but as there's no question of Molly in this business, I don't
see the use of bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) name in, and considering either her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
family or her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, to be sure not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, rousing up. <div class="bookquote">``My wits had gone
far afield, and I'll own I was only thinking what a pity it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
wouldn't do for Osborne. But, of course, it's out of the
question--out of the question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, <div class="bookquote">``and if you will excuse me, Squire, I really
must go now, and then you'll be at liberty to send your wits afield
uninterrupted.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was at the door before the Squire
called him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) stood impatiently hitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) top-boots with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
riding-whip, waiting for the interminable last words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Gibson, we're old friends, and you're a fool if you take
anything I say as an offence. Madam your wife and I didn't hit it off
the only time I ever saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I won't say she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was silly, but I think
one of us was silly, and it wasn't me. However, we'll pass that over.
Suppose you bring her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and this girl Cynthia -LRB-which is as outlandish
a Christian name as I'd wish to hear-RRB-, and little Molly out here to
lunch some day,--I'm more at my ease in my own house,--and I'm more
sure to be civil, too. We need say nothing about Roger,--neither the
lass nor me,--and you keep your wife's tongue quiet, if you can. It
will only be like a compliment to you on your marriage, you know--and
no one must take it for anything more. Mind, no allusion or mention
of Roger, and this piece of folly. I shall see the girl then, and
I can judge her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for myself; for, as you say, that will be the best
plan. Osborne will be here too; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s always in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) element
talking to women. I sometimes think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s half a woman himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
spends so much money and is so unreasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire was pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own speech and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own thought, and
smiled a little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) finished speaking. Mr. Gibson was both pleased
and amused; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) smiled too, anxious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was to be gone. The next
Thursday was soon fixed upon as the day on which Mr. Gibson was to
bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) womenkind out to the Hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought that, on the whole,
the interview had gone off a good deal better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had expected,
and felt rather proud of the invitation of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was the bearer.
Therefore Mrs. Gibson's manner of receiving it was an annoyance to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), meanwhile, had been considering herself as an injured woman
ever since the evening of the day of Roger's departure; what business
had any one had to speak as if the chances of Osborne's life being
prolonged were infinitely small, if in fact the matter was uncertain?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) liked Osborne extremely, much better than Roger; and would gladly
have schemed to secure him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) for Cynthia, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had not shrunk from
the notion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) daughter's becoming a widow. For if Mrs. Gibson had
ever felt anything acutely it was the death of Mr. Kirkpatrick; and,
amiably callous as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was in most things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) recoiled from exposing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter wilfully to the same kind of suffering which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) herself
had experienced. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had only known Dr. Nicholls' opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
would never have favoured Roger's suit; never. And then Mr. Gibson
himself; why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) so cold and reserved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
since that night of explanation? She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had done nothing wrong; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
was treated as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) were in disgrace. And everything about
the house was flat just now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) even missed the little excitement
of Roger's visits, and the watching of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) attentions to Cynthia.
Cynthia too was silent enough; and as for Molly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was absolutely
dull and out of spirits, a state of mind so annoying to Mrs. Gibson
just now, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) vented some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) discontent upon the poor girl,
from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) feared neither complaint nor repartee.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI.

<p/>DOMESTIC DIPLOMACY.


<p/>The evening of the day on which Mr. Gibson had been to see the
Squire, the three women were alone in the drawing-room, for Mr.
Gibson had had a long round and was not as yet come in. They had had
to wait dinner for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); and for some time after his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) return there was
nothing done or said but what related to the necessary business of
eating. Mr. Gibson was, perhaps, as well satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) day's
work as any of the four; for this visit to the Squire had been
weighing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had heard of the state of things
between Roger and Cynthia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not like the having to go and
tell of a love-affair so soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) belief
that no such thing existed; it was a confession of fallibility
which is distasteful to most men. If the Squire had not been of
so unsuspicious and simple a nature, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might have drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own
conclusions from the apparent concealment of facts, and felt doubtful
of Mr. Gibson's perfect honesty in the business; but being what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was, there was no danger of such unjust misapprehension. Still
Mr. Gibson knew the hot hasty temper he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had to deal with, and had
expected more violence of language than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) really encountered; and
the last arrangement by which Cynthia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother, and Molly--who, as
Mr. Gibson thought to himself, and smiled at the thought, was sure to
be a peacemaker, and a sweetener of intercourse--were to go to the
Hall and make acquaintance with the Squire, appeared like a great
success to Mr. Gibson, for achieving which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took not a little
credit to himself. Altogether, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was more cheerful and bland than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
had been for many days; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came up into the drawing-room for
a few minutes after dinner, before going out again to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) town
patients, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) whistled a little under his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) breath, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
back to the fire, looking at Cynthia, and thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had not
done her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) justice when describing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to the Squire. Now this soft,
almost tuneless whistling, was to Mr. Gibson what purring is to a
cat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could no more have done it with an anxious case on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind,
or when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was annoyed by human folly, or when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was hungry, than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could have flown through the air. Molly knew all this by instinct,
and was happy without being aware of it, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard the low
whistle which was no music after all. But Mrs. Gibson did not like
this trick of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband's; it was not refined she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought, not even
<div class="bookquote">``artistic;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could have called it by this fine word it would
have compensated her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) for the want of refinement. To-night it was
particularly irritating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) nerves; but since her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) conversation
with Mr. Gibson about Cynthia's engagement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had not felt herself
in a sufficiently good position to complain.

<p/>Mr. Gibson began,--<div class="bookquote">``Well, Cynthia; I've seen the Squire to-day, and
made a clean breast of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia looked up quickly, questioning with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes; Molly stopped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) netting to listen; no one spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're all to go there on Thursday to lunch; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) asked you all, and I
promised for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Still no reply; natural, perhaps, but very flat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be glad of that, Cynthia, shan't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``It
may be a little formidable, but I hope it will be the beginning of a
good understanding between you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), with an effort. <div class="bookquote">``But--but won't it make it
public? I do so wish not to have it known, or talked about, not till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) comes back or close upon the marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how it should make it public,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``My
wife goes to lunch with my friend, and takes her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughters with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--there's nothing in that, is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I shall go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>put in Mrs. Gibson. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not
know why she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fully intended to go all the time; but
having said it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was bound to stick to it for a little while; and,
with such a husband as hers, the hard necessity was sure to fall upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of having to find a reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) saying. Then it came, quick
and sharp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), turning round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, because--because I think he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ought to have called on Cynthia
first; I've that sort of sensitiveness I can't bear to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
being slighted because she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``I do assure you, no slight whatever
was intended. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does not wish to speak about the engagement to any
one--not even to Osborne--that's your wish, too, isn't it, Cynthia?
Nor does he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) intend to mention it to any of you when you go there;
but, naturally enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wants to make acquaintance with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) future
daughter-in-law. If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) deviated so much from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) usual course as to
come calling here--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to come calling here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson,
interrupting. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not so very agreeable the only time he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did
come. But I am that sort of a character that I cannot put up with
any neglect of persons I love, just because they are not smiled upon
by fortune.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sighed a little ostentatiously as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ended her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
sentence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, you won't go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, provoked, but not
wishing to have a long discussion, especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) temper
going.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish it, Cynthia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, anxious for an excuse to
yield.

<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter was quite aware of this motive for the question, and
replied quietly,--<div class="bookquote">``Not particularly, mamma. I am quite willing to
refuse the invitation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is already accepted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, almost ready to vow
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would never again meddle in any affair in which women were
concerned, which would effectually shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) out from all love-affairs
for the future. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been touched by the Squire's relenting,
pleased with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had thought would give others pleasure, and this
was the end of it!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do go, Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, pleading with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes as well as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) words. <div class="bookquote">``Do; I am sure you will like the Squire; and it is such a
pretty place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)'ll be so much disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not like to give up my dignity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, demurely.
<div class="bookquote">``And you heard what mamma said!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very malicious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) fully intended to go, and was
equally sure that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother was already planning her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) dress for the
occasion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own mind. Mr. Gibson, however, who, surgeon though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was, had never learnt to anatomize a woman's heart, took it all
literally, and was excessively angry both with Cynthia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
mother; so angry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not dare to trust himself to speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
went quickly to the door, intending to leave the room; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife's
voice arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, do you wish me to go? if you do, I will put my own feelings
on one side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said, short and stern, and left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll go!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), in the voice of a victim--those words were
meant for him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) hardly heard them. ``And we'll have a fly from
the ``George,<div class="bookquote">'' and get a livery-coat for Thomas, which I've long been
wanting, only dear Mr. Gibson did not like it, but on an occasion
like this I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) won't mind; and Thomas shall go on the box,
and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George du Maurier</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, mamma, I've my feelings too,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George du Maurier</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, child! when all is so nicely arranged too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So they went on the day appointed. Mr. Gibson was aware of the change
of plans, and that they were going after all; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was so much
annoyed by the manner in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife had received an invitation
that appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) so much kinder than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had expected from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
previous knowledge of the Squire, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wishes on the subject of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sons' marriage, that Mrs. Gibson heard neither interest nor
curiosity expressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband as to the visit itself, or the
reception they met with. Cynthia's indifference as to whether the
invitation was accepted or not had displeased Mr. Gibson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ways with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother, and did not understand how much of
this said indifference had been assumed in order to countervent Mrs.
Gibson's affectation and false sentiment. But for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) annoyance
on the subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was, in fact, very curious to know how the visit
had gone off, and took the first opportunity of being alone with
Molly to question her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) about the lunch of the day before at Hamley
Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you went to Hamley yesterday after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I thought you would have come. The Squire seemed quite to
expect you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought of going there at first; but I changed my mind like
other people. I don't see why women are to have a monopoly of
changeableness. Well! how did it go off? Pleasantly, I suppose, for
both your mother and Cynthia were in high spirits last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. The dear old Squire was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) best dress and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) best
behaviour, and was so prettily attentive to Cynthia, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) looked
so lovely, walking about with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and listening to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) talk
about the garden and farm. Mamma was tired, and stopped in-doors, so
they got on very well, and saw a great deal of each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my little girl trotted behind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. You know I was almost at home, and besides--of course--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly went very red, and left the sentence unfinished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Roger, papa? oh, who is? But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is very sweet, and very, very
charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very charming if you will, but somehow I don't quite understand her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) want all this secrecy? Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not more eager to go
and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) duty to Roger's father? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took it as coolly as if I'd
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to go to church!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did take it coolly; I believe I don't quite
understand her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) either, but I love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dearly all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Umph; I like to understand people thoroughly, but I know it's not
necessary to women. D'ye really think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa--''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stopped; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wanted to speak in
favour of Cynthia, but somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could form no reply that pleased
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to this repeated inquiry. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not seem much to care whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
got an answer or not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own thoughts, and the
result was that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked Molly if Cynthia had heard from Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; on Wednesday morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) show it to you? But of course not. Besides, I read the
Squire's letter, which told all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Cynthia, rather to Molly's surprise, had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might
read the letter if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) liked, and Molly had shrunk from availing
herself of the permission, for Roger's sake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
would probably have poured out his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) heart to the one sole person, and
that it was not fair to listen, as it were, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) confidences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Osborne at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``The Squire said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did
not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would have come back; but the young fellow is so
uncertain--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was still from home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Then Molly blushed all over crimson,
for it suddenly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that Osborne was probably with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
wife--that mysterious wife, of whose existence she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was cognizant,
but of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) knew so little, and of whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) father knew nothing.
Mr. Gibson noticed the blush with anxiety. What did it mean? It was
troublesome enough to find that one of the Squire's precious sons
had fallen in love within the prohibited ranks; and what would not
have to be said and done if anything fresh were to come out between
Osborne and Molly? He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) spoke out at once to relieve himself of this
new apprehension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, I was taken by surprise by this affair between Cynthia and
Roger Hamley--if there's anything more on the tapis let me know at
once, honestly and openly. I know it's an awkward question for you to
reply to; but I wouldn't ask it unless I had good reasons.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) with clear, truthful eyes,
which filled with tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not know why the tears
came; perhaps it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was not so strong as formerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean that you're afraid that Osborne thinks of me as Roger
thinks of Cynthia, papa, you are quite mistaken. Osborne and I are
friends and nothing more, and never can be anything more. That's all
I can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's quite enough, little one. It's a great relief. I don't want to
have my Molly carried off by any young man just yet; I should miss
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sadly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) could not help saying this in the fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) heart
just then, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was surprised at the effect these few tender words
produced. Molly threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) neck, and began to sob
bitterly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``There, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>),
patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) on the back, and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to the sofa, <div class="bookquote">``that will do.
I get quite enough of tears in the day, shed for real causes, not to
want them at home, where, I hope, they are shed for no cause at all.
There's nothing really the matter, is there, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) continued,
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a little away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tears; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not see the look of
sadness which returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face after he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, dear, dear papa--nothing now. It is such a comfort to have
you all to myself--it makes me happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson knew all implied in these words, and felt that there was
no effectual help for the state of things which had arisen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
own act. It was better for them both that they should not speak out
more fully. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right, dear! I can leave you in comfort now, and indeed I've
stayed too long already gossiping. Go out and have a walk--take
Cynthia with you, if you like. I must be off. Good-by, little one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) commonplace words acted like an astringent on Molly's relaxed
feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) intended that they should do so; it was the truest
kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) walked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with a sharp pang at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
heart, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stunned into numbness as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could by throwing
himself violently into the affairs and cares of others.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVII.

<p/>A FLUKE, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>The honour and glory of having a lover of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own was soon to fall
to Molly's share; though, to be sure, it was a little deduction from
the honour that the man who came with the full intention of proposing
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), ended by making Cynthia an offer. It was Mr. Coxe, who came
back to Hollingford to follow out the purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) had announced to Mr.
Gibson nearly two years before, of inducing Molly to become his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) should have succeeded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) uncle's estate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was now
a rich, though still a red-haired, young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to the George
Inn, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horses and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) groom; not that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to ride
much, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought such outward signs of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) riches might help
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suit; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so justly modest in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) estimation of himself
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed all extraneous aid. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) piqued himself
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) constancy; and indeed, considering that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been so much
restrained by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expectations to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
crabbed old uncle, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been able to go much into society,
and very rarely indeed into the company of young ladies, such
fidelity to Molly was very meritorious, at least in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own eyes. Mr.
Gibson too was touched by it, and made it a point of honour to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) a fair field, all the time sincerely hoping that Molly would not
be such a goose as to lend a willing ear to a youth who could never
remember the difference between apophysis and epiphysis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought
it as well not to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife more of Mr. Coxe's antecedents than
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been a former pupil; who had relinquished -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``all that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
knew of,''  (<font color='red'><b>a pupil</b></font>)</div>understood-RRB- the medical profession because an old uncle
had left him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) enough of money to be idle. Mrs. Gibson, who felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had somehow lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband's favour, took it into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could reinstate herself if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was successful
in finding a good match for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) daughter Molly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
husband had forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to try for this end, as distinctly as
words could express a meaning; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own words so seldom expressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) meaning, or if they did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) held to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) opinions so loosely,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had no idea but that it was the same with other people.
Accordingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gave Mr. Coxe a very sweet and gracious welcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is such a pleasure to me to make acquaintance with the former
pupils of my husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has spoken to me so often of you that I
quite feel as if you were one of the family, as indeed I am sure that
Mr. Gibson considers you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Coxe felt much flattered, and took the words as a happy omen for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) love-affair. <div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Gibson in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>), blushing violently.
<div class="bookquote">``I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) formerly--that is to say, I lived in the same house
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), for more than two years, and it would be a great pleasure
to--to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) will be so glad to see you. I sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
and Cynthia--you don't know my daughter Cynthia, I think, Mr. Coxe?
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) and Molly are such great friends--out for a brisk walk this
frosty day, but I think they will soon come back.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went on saying
agreeable nothings to the young man, who received her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) attentions
with a certain complacency, but was all the time much more engaged
in listening to the well-remembered click at the front door,--the
shutting it to again with household care, and the sound of the
familiar bounding footstep on the stair. At last they came. Cynthia
entered first, bright and blooming, fresh colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cheeks and
lips, fresh brilliance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) looked startled at the sight
of a stranger, and for an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stopped short at the door, as
if taken by surprise. Then in came Molly softly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), smiling,
happy, dimpled; but not such a glowing beauty as Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Coxe, is it you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) with an
outstretched hand, and greeting him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) with simple friendliness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it seems such a long time since I saw you. You are so much
grown--so much--well, I suppose I mustn't say what,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) replied,
speaking hurriedly, and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand all the time, rather to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) discomfiture. Then Mrs. Gibson introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter, and the
two girls spoke of the enjoyment of their walk. Mr. Coxe marred his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>)
cause in that very first interview, if indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) ever could have
had any chance, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) precipitancy in showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) feelings, and
Mrs. Gibson helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) to mar it by trying to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>). Molly lost
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) open friendliness of manner, and began to shrink away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>)
in a way which he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) thought was a very ungrateful return for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>)
faithfulness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) these two years past; and after all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was not
the wonderful beauty his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) fancy or his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) love had painted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). That Miss
Kirkpatrick was far more beautiful and much easier of access. For
Cynthia put on all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) pretty airs--her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) look of intent interest in
what any one was saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), let the subject be what it would,
as if it was the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cared most about in the whole world; her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
unspoken deference; in short, all the unconscious ways she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) possessed
by instinct of tickling the vanity of men. So while Molly quietly
repelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>), Cynthia drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) soft attractive ways;
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) constancy fell before her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) charms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was thankful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) had
not gone too far with Molly, and grateful to Mr. Gibson for having
prohibited all declarations two years ago; for Cynthia, and Cynthia
alone, could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) happy. After a fortnight's time, during which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had entirely veered round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) allegiance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought it
desirable to speak to Mr. Gibson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did so with a certain sense
of exultation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own correct behaviour in the affair, but at
the same time feeling rather ashamed of the confession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own
changeableness which was naturally involved. Now it had so happened
that Mr. Gibson had been unusually little at home during the
fortnight that Mr. Coxe had ostensibly lodged at the <div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>but
in reality had spent the greater part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) time at Mr. Gibson's
house--so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had seen very little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) former pupil, and on
the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) improved, especially after Molly's
manner had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father pretty sure that Mr. Coxe stood no chance
in that quarter. But Mr. Gibson was quite ignorant of the attraction
which Cynthia had had for the young man. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had perceived it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
would have nipped it in the bud pretty quickly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had no notion
of any girl, even though only partially engaged to one man, receiving
offers from others, if a little plain speaking could prevent it. Mr.
Coxe had asked for a private interview; they were sitting in the old
surgery, now called the consulting-room, but still retaining so much
of its former self as to be the last place in which Mr. Coxe could
feel himself at ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was red up to the very roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) red
hair, and kept turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) glossy new hat round and round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>)
fingers, unable to find out the proper way of beginning his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) sentence,
so at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) plunged in, grammar or no grammar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gibson, I daresay you'll be surprised, I'm sure I am at--at what

first, and as you, sir, stand in the place of a father to Miss

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Kirkpatrick?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, a good deal surprised.

smoothed the nap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) hat, smiling a little while he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) did so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``While Miss Kirkpatrick--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Gibson, in such a stern
voice, that Mr. Coxe, landed esquire as he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was now, felt as much
discomfited as he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) used to do when he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was an apprentice, and Mr.
Gibson had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in a similar manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only going to say, sir, that so far as one can judge from
manner, and willingness to listen, and apparent pleasure in my
visits--altogether, I think I may venture to hope that Miss

have no objection, have you, sir, to my speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), I mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Coxe, a little anxious at the expression on Mr. Gibson's
face. <div class="bookquote">``I do assure you I haven't a chance with Miss Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
continued, not knowing what to say, and fancying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) inconstancy
was rankling in Mr. Gibson's mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I don't suppose you have. Don't go and fancy it is that which is
annoying me. You're mistaken about Miss Kirkpatrick, however. I don't
believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) could ever have meant to give you encouragement!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Coxe's face grew perceptibly paler. His (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) feelings, if evanescent,
were evidently strong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, sir, if you could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)--I don't consider myself
vain, and manner is so difficult to describe. At any rate, you can
have no objection to my taking my chance, and speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if you won't be convinced otherwise, I can have no
objection. But if you'll take my advice, you will spare yourself the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Coxe. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gibson, there must be some
mistake. I have gone as far as I dared in expressing my feelings,

misunderstood my meaning. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) mind? It is
possible that, after consideration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) has learnt to prefer another,
is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``By ``another,<div class="bookquote">'' you mean yourself, I suppose. I can believe in such

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, my poor fellow'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--for, intermingled with a little

evanescent--<div class="bookquote">``I will send her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) to you directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir. God bless you for a kind friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson went upstairs to the drawing-room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was pretty
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) should find Cynthia. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was, as bright and careless as
usual, making up a bonnet for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother, and chattering to Molly as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) worked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia, you will oblige me by going down into my consulting-room at
once. Mr. Coxe wants to speak to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Coxe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) want with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Evidently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own question as soon as it was asked, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) coloured, and avoided meeting Mr. Gibson's severe, uncompromising
look. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had left the room, Mr. Gibson sat down,
and took up a new _Edinburgh_ lying on the table, as an excuse
for conversation. Was there anything in the article that made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) say, after a minute or two, to Molly, who sat silent and
wondering--<div class="bookquote">``Molly, you must never trifle with the love of an honest
man. You don't know what pain you may give.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently Cynthia came back into the drawing-room, looking very
much confused. Most likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would not have returned if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
known that Mr. Gibson was still there; but it was such an unheard-of
thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to be sitting in that room in the middle of the day,
reading or making pretence to read, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had never thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
remaining. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) came in, so there was
nothing for it but putting a bold face on it, and going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Coxe still downstairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) is gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) asked me to give you both his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) kind regards. I
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) is leaving this afternoon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia tried to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
manner as commonplace as possible; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not look up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
voice trembled a little.

<p/>Mr. Gibson went on looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) book for a few minutes; but Cynthia
felt that more was coming, and only wished it would come quickly, for
the severe silence was very hard to bear. It came at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust this will never occur again, Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), in grave
displeasure. <div class="bookquote">``I should not feel satisfied with the conduct of any
girl, however free, who could receive marked attentions from a young
man with complacency, and so lead him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on to make an offer which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
never meant to accept. But what must I think of a young woman in
your position, engaged--yet `accepting most graciously,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Coxe/Coxe</b></font>)</div>for that
was the way Coxe expressed it--the overtures of another man? Do you
consider what unnecessary pain you have given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by your thoughtless
behaviour? I call it thoughtless, but it's the mildest epithet I can
apply to it. I beg that such a thing may not occur again, or I shall
be obliged to characterize it more severely.''


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``I TRUST THIS WILL NEVER OCCUR AGAIN, CYNTHIA!'' (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>Molly could not imagine what <div class="bookquote">``more severely''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>could be, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father's manner appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) almost cruel in its sternness.
Cynthia coloured up extremely, then went pale, and at length raised
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) beautiful appealing eyes full of tears to Mr. Gibson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
touched by that look, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) resolved immediately not to be mollified
by any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) physical charms of expression, but to keep to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sober
judgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, Mr. Gibson, hear my side of the story before you speak so
hardly to me. I did not mean to--to flirt. I merely meant to make
myself agreeable,--I can't help doing that,--and that goose of a Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you were not aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was falling in love with
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gibson was melting into a readiness to be convinced by that
sweet voice and pleading face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose I must speak truly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia blushed and
smiled--ever so little--but it was a smile, and it hardened Mr.
Gibson's heart again. <div class="bookquote">``I did think once or twice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was becoming
a little more complimentary than the occasion required; but I hate
throwing cold water on people, and I never thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) could take it
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) silly head to fancy himself seriously in love, and to make
such a fuss at the last, after only a fortnight's acquaintance.''

respected and liked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) took up another point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) defence, and
rather made matters worse. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, Roger would not allow me to

at once, to put a stop to the conversation, the continuance of which
would serve no useful purpose, and perhaps end by irritating him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not guilty, but we recommend the prisoner not to do it again. It's
pretty much that, isn't it, Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tears
downfall, even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I do believe your father might make

me for years instead of only for days. I daresay only for hours if

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had a question at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tongue's end that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) longed to put; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)

it interrupted.

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) work, and sat silent, looking into the future; at

from speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do! It's not in my nature to go into ecstasies, and I don't

Cynthia seemed thoroughly in earnest. Why Mr. Preston was introduced
neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) nor Molly knew; it came up and out by a sudden impulse;
but a fierce look came into the eyes, and the soft lips contracted
themselves as Cynthia named his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) name. Molly had noticed this look
before, always at the mention of this one person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia, what makes you dislike Mr. Preston so much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you? Why do you ask me? and yet, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), suddenly

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)! Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) ever asked you?''

her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own thoughts,--<div class="bookquote">``More unlikely things have happened. Have you
never heard of strong wills mesmerizing weaker ones into submission?
One of the girls at Madame Lefevre's went out as a governess to a
Russian family, who lived near Moscow. I sometimes think I'll write
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to find me a situation in Russia, just to get out of the daily
chance of seeing that man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But sometimes you seem quite intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I help it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia impatiently. Then recovering
herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``We knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so well at Ashcombe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not a
man to be easily thrown off, I can tell you. I must be civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);
it's not from liking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows it's not, for I've told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so.
However, we won't talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I don't know how we came to do it,
I'm sure: the mere fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) existence, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being within
half a mile of us, is bad enough. Oh! I wish Roger was at home,
and rich, and could marry me at once, and carry me away from that
man! If I'd thought of it, I really believe I would have taken poor
red-haired Mr. Coxe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I dislike Mr. Preston,
but I should never think of taking such violent steps as you speak
of, to get away from the neighbourhood in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, because you are a reasonable little darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia,
resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) usual manner, and coming up to Molly, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``At least you'll acknowledge I'm a good hater!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But still I don't understand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, never mind! There are old complications with our affairs at
Ashcombe. Money matters are at the root of it all. Horrid poverty--do
let us talk of something else! Or, better still, let me go and finish
my letter to Roger, or I shall be too late for the African mail!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it gone? Oh, I ought to have reminded you! It will be too
late. Did you not see the notice at the post-office that letters
ought to be in London on the morning of the 10th instead of the
evening. Oh, I am so sorry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I, but it can't be helped. It is to be hoped it will be the
greater treat when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) does get it. I've a far greater weight on my
heart, because your father seems so displeased with me. I was fond
of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is making me quite a coward. You see, Molly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), a little piteously, <div class="bookquote">``I've never lived with people with
such a high standard of conduct before; and I don't quite know how to
behave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``You'll find Roger quite as
strict in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) notions of right and wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s in love with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, with a pretty
consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) power. Molly turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head, and was
silent; it was of no use combating the truth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tried rather
not to feel it--not to feel, poor girl, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) too had a great
weight on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart, into the cause of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shrank from
examining. That whole winter long she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sun was all
shrouded over with grey mist, and could no longer shine brightly for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wakened up in the morning with a dull sense of something
being wrong; the world was out of joint, and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were born to set
it right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not know how to do it. Blind herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not help perceiving that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father was not satisfied with
the wife he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had chosen. For a long time Molly had been surprised at
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) apparent contentment; sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been unselfish enough to
be glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was satisfied; but still more frequently nature would
have its way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was almost irritated at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) considered
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blindness. Something, however, had changed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now: something
that had arisen at the time of Cynthia's engagement. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had become
nervously sensitive to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife's failings, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whole manner
had grown dry and sarcastic, not merely to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but sometimes to
Cynthia,--and even--but this very rarely, to Molly herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
not a man to go into passions, or ebullitions of feeling: they would
have relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), even while degrading him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own eyes; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) became hard, and occasionally bitter in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speeches and ways.
Molly now learnt to long after the vanished blindness in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father had passed the first year of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marriage; yet there were no
outrageous infractions of domestic peace. Some people might say that
Mr. Gibson <div class="bookquote">``accepted the inevitable;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) told himself in more homely
phrase <div class="bookquote">``that it was no use crying over spilt milk:''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), from
principle, avoided all actual dissensions with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife, preferring
to cut short a discussion by a sarcasm, or by leaving the room.
Moreover, Mrs. Gibson had a very tolerable temper of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
cat-like nature purred and delighted in smooth ways, and pleasant
quietness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had no great facility for understanding sarcasm; it
is true it disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not quick at deciphering
any depth of meaning, and felt it unpleasant to think about it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
forgot it as soon as possible. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was often in some kind
of disfavour with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband, and it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) uneasy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) resembled
Cynthia in this: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) liked to be liked; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wanted to regain
the esteem which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not perceive she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had lost for ever. Molly
sometimes took her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother's part in secret; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) herself could never have borne her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's hard speeches so
patiently; they would have cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to the heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must either
have demanded an explanation, and probed the sore to the bottom, or
sat down despairing and miserable. Instead of which Mrs. Gibson,
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband had left the room, on these occasions would say in
a manner more bewildered than hurt--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think dear papa seems a little put out to-day; we must see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
has a dinner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) likes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) comes home. I have often perceived
that everything depends on making a man comfortable in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>And thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went on, groping about to find the means of reinstating
herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) good graces--really trying, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lights,
till Molly was often compelled to pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in spite of herself, and
although she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother was the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's
increased astringency of disposition. For, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had got into
that kind of exaggerated susceptibility with regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife's
faults, which may be best typified by the state of bodily irritation
that is produced by the constant recurrence of any particular noise:
those who are brought within hearing of it, are apt to be always on
the watch for the repetition, if they are once made to notice it, and
are in an irritable state of nerves.

<p/>So that poor Molly had not passed a cheerful winter, independently of
any private sorrows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might have in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not
look well, either: she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was gradually falling into low health, rather
than bad health. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart beat more feebly and slower; the vivifying
stimulant of hope--even unacknowledged hope--was gone out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
life. It seemed as if there was not, and never could be in this
world, any help for the dumb discordancy between her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wife. Day after day, month after month, year after year, would Molly
have to sympathize with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, and pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother, feeling
acutely for both, and certainly more than Mrs. Gibson felt for
herself. Molly could not imagine how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had at one time wished for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's eyes to be opened, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could ever have fancied
that if they were, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be able to change things in Mrs. Gibson's
character. It was all hopeless, and the only attempt at a remedy was
to think about it as little as possible. Then Cynthia's ways and
manners about Roger gave Molly a great deal of uneasiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did
not believe that Cynthia cared enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); at any rate, not with
the sort of love that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) herself would have bestowed, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
been so happy--no, that was not it--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had been in Cynthia's
place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) should have gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) both hands held
out, full and brimming over with tenderness, and been grateful for
every word of precious confidence bestowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Yet Cynthia
received his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) letters with a kind of carelessness, and read them with
a strange indifference, while Molly sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) feet, so to speak,
looking up with eyes as wistful as a dog's waiting for crumbs, and
such chance beneficences.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tried to be patient on these occasions, but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must
ask--<div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Cynthia? What does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>By this time Cynthia
had put down the letter on the table by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), smiling a little from
time to time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) remembered the loving compliments it contained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where? Oh, I didn't look exactly--somewhere in Abyssinia--Huon. I
can't read the word, and it doesn't much signify, for it would give
me no idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked greedy Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, now. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had a slight touch of fever, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says; but it's all
over now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is getting acclimatized.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of fever!--and who took care of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would want nursing,--and so
far from home. Oh, Cynthia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had any nursing, poor fellow! One doesn't
expect nursing, and hospitals, and doctors in Abyssinia; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
plenty of quinine with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I suppose that is the best specific.
At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is quite well now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly sat silent for a minute or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the date of the letter, Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't look. December the--December the 10th.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nearly two months ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I determined I wouldn't worry myself with useless anxiety,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went away. If anything did--go wrong, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said
Cynthia, using a euphuism for death, as most people do -LRB-it is an
ugly word to speak plain out in the midst of life-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``it would be all
over before I even heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) illness, and I could be of no use to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--could I, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I daresay it is all very true; only I should think the Squire
could not take it so easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always write him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) a little note when I hear from Roger, but I don't
think I'll name this touch of fever--shall I, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``People say one ought, but I almost wish
I hadn't heard it. Please, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) say anything else that I may
hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, lovers' letters are so silly, and I think this is sillier than
usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, looking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) letter again. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a piece
you may read, from that line to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>indicating two places. <div class="bookquote">``I
haven't read it myself for it looked dullish--all about Aristotle and
Pliny--and I want to get this bonnet-cap made up before we go out to
pay our calls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly took the letter, the thought crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
touched it, had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hands upon it, in those far distant desert
lands, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) might be lost to sight and to any human knowledge
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) fate; even now her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty brown fingers almost caressed the
flimsy paper with their delicacy of touch as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) read. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw
references made to books, which, with a little trouble, would be
accessible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) here in Hollingford. Perhaps the details and the
references would make the letter dull and dry to some people, but not
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) former teaching and the interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had excited
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) pursuits. But, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said in apology, what had he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to
write about in that savage land, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) love, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) researches,
and travels? There was no society, no gaiety, no new books to write
about, no gossip in Abyssinian wilds.

<p/>Molly was not in strong health, and perhaps this made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a little
fanciful; but certain it is that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thoughts by day and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dreams
by night were haunted by the idea of Roger lying ill and untended in
those savage lands. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) constant prayer, <div class="bookquote">``O my Lord! give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) the
living child, and in no wise slay it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>came from a heart as true as
that of the real mother in King Solomon's judgment. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) live,
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) live, even though I may never set eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) again. Have
pity upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) father! Grant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) may come home safe, and live
happily with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loves so tenderly--so tenderly, O God.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would burst into tears, and drop asleep at last, sobbing.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII.

<p/>MR. KIRKPATRICK, Q.C.


<p/>Cynthia was always the same with Molly: kind, sweet-tempered, ready
to help, professing a great deal of love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and probably
feeling as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did for any one in the world. But Molly had
reached to this superficial depth of affection and intimacy in the
first few weeks of Cynthia's residence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) father's house; and if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had been of a nature prone to analyse the character of one whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) loved dearly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) might have perceived that, with all Cynthia's
apparent frankness, there were certain limits beyond which her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
confidence did not go; where her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) reserve began, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) real self was
shrouded in mystery. For instance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) relations with Mr. Preston
were often very puzzling to Molly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sure that there had been a
much greater intimacy between them formerly at Ashcombe, and that the
remembrance of this was often very galling and irritating to Cynthia,
who was as evidently desirous of forgetting it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was anxious
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) remember it. But why this intimacy had ceased, why
Cynthia disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) so extremely now, and many other unexplained
circumstances connected with these two facts, were Cynthia's secrets;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) effectually baffled all Molly's innocent attempts during
the first glow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) friendship for Cynthia, to learn the girlish
antecedents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) companion's life. Every now and then Molly came
to a dead wall, beyond which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not pass--at least with the
delicate instruments which were all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) chose to use. Perhaps Cynthia
might have told all there was to tell to a more forcible curiosity,
which knew how to improve every slip of the tongue and every fit of
temper to its own gratification. But Molly's was the interest of
affection, not the coarser desire of knowing everything for a little
excitement; and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw that Cynthia did not wish to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) anything about that period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) life, Molly left off referring
to it. But if Cynthia had preserved a sweet tranquillity of manner
and an unvarying kindness for Molly during the winter of which there
is question, at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was the only person to whom the beauty's
ways were unchanged. Mr. Gibson's influence had been good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as
long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had tried to keep as high a
place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) good opinion as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could, and had curbed many a little
sarcasm against her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother, and many a twisting of the absolute
truth when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was by. Now there was a constant uneasiness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) more cowardly than before; and even her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) partisan,
Molly, could not help being aware of the distinct equivocations she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
occasionally used when anything in Mr. Gibson's words or behaviour
pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) too hard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) repartees to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother were less frequent
than they had been, but there was often the unusual phenomenon
of pettishness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). These changes in humour
and disposition, here described all at once, were in themselves a
series of delicate alterations of relative conduct spread over many
months--many winter months of long evenings and bad weather, which
bring out discords of character, as a dash of cold water brings out
the fading colours of an old fresco.

<p/>During much of this time Mr. Preston had been at Ashcombe; for Lord
Cumnor had not been able to find an agent whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) liked to replace
Mr. Preston; and while the inferior situation remained vacant Mr.
Preston had undertaken to do the duties of both. Mrs. Goodenough had
had a serious illness; and the little society at Hollingford did not
care to meet while one of their habitual set was scarcely out of
danger. So there had been very little visiting; and though Miss
Browning said that the absence of the temptations of society was very
agreeable to cultivated minds, after the dissipations of the previous
autumn, when there were parties every week to welcome Mr. Preston,
yet Miss Phoebe let out in confidence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister had
fallen into the habit of going to bed at nine o'clock, for they found
cribbage night after night, from five o'clock till ten, rather too
much of a good thing. To tell the truth, that winter, if peaceful,
was monotonous in Hollingford; and the whole circle of gentility
there was delighted to be stirred up in March by the intelligence
that Mr. Kirkpatrick, the newly-made Q.C., was coming on a visit for
a couple of days to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) sister-in-law, Mrs. Gibson. Mrs. Goodenough's
room was the very centre of gossip; gossip had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) daily bread
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) life, gossip was meat and wine to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear-ah-me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady relations</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, rousing herself so as to sit upright
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) easy-chair, and propping herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) hands on the arms;
<div class="bookquote">``who would ha' thought she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d such grand relations! Why, Mr. Ashton
told me once that a Queen's counsel was as like to be a judge as a
kitten is like to be a cat. And to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) being as good as
a sister to a judge! I saw one oncst; and I know I thought as I
shouldn't wish for a better winter-cloak than his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) old robes would
make me, if I could only find out where I could get 'em second-hand.
And I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)'d her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) silk gowns turned and dyed and cleaned, and, for
aught I know, turned again, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) lived at Ashcombe. Keeping a
school, too, and so near akin to this Queen's counsel all the time!
Well, to be sure, it wasn't much of a school--only ten young ladies
at the best o' times; so perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) never heard of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady relations</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been wondering what they'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) to dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning. <div class="bookquote">``It is an unlucky time for visitors; no game to be had,

money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)'ll have to put up with calf's head, that he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Goodenough, solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``If I'd ha' got my usual health I'd copy out
a receipt of my grandmother's for a rolled calf's head, and send it
to Mrs. Gibson--the doctor has been very kind to me all through this
illness--I wish my daughter in Combermere would send me some autumn
chickens--I'd pass 'em on to the doctor, that I would; but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s been
a-killing of 'em all, and a-sending of them to me, and the last she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if they'll give a party for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>suggested Miss Phoebe.

been feeling the same wonder, but had not thought it maidenly to
express it, even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister, who was the source of knowledge,
having met Mrs. Gibson in the street on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) way to Mrs. Goodenough's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)'s married, and must have several children, for Mrs. Gibson
said that Cynthia Kirkpatrick had paid them a visit in London, to
have lessons with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) cousins. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) said that his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) wife was a most
accomplished woman, and of good family, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) no
fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very creditable connection, I'm sure; it's only a wonder
to me as how we've heard so little talk of it before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Goodenough. ``At the first look of the thing, I shouldn't ha' thought
Mrs. Gibson was one to hide away her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fine relations under a bushel;
indeed, for that matter, we're all of us fond o' turning the best
breadth o' the gown to the front. I remember, speaking o' breadths,
how I've undone my skirts many a time and oft to put a stain or a
grease-spot next to poor Mr. Goodenough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>)'d a soft kind of heart
when first we was married, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) said, says he (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Patty, link thy
right arm into my left one, then thou`lt be nearer to my heart;' and
so we kept up the habit, when, poor man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d a deal more to think on
than romancing on which side his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart lay; so, as I said, I always
put my damaged breadths on the right hand, and when we walked arm in
arm, as we always did, no one was never the wiser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not be surprised if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) invited Cynthia to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) another
visit in London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was poor,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, work it by the rule o' three, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) stands a good chance. I
only hope it won't turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head; going up visiting in London at her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
age. Why, I was fifty before ever I went!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) has been in France; she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)'s quite a travelled young lady,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe.

<p/>Mrs. Goodenough shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) head for a whole minute before she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) gave
vent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) opinion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a risk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a great risk. I don't like saying so to
the doctor, but I shouldn't like having my daughter, if I was him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>),
so cheek-by-jowl with a girl as was brought up in the country where
Robespierre and Bonyparte was born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Buonaparte was a Corsican,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, who was much
farther advanced both in knowledge and in liberality of opinions than
Mrs. Goodenough. <div class="bookquote">``And there's a great opportunity for cultivation of
the mind afforded by intercourse with foreign countries. I always
admire Cynthia's grace of manner, never too shy to speak, yet never
putting herself forwards; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s quite a help to a party; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
has a few airs and graces, why they're natural at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) age! Now as for
dear Molly, there's a kind of awkwardness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) broke one of
our best china cups last time she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was at a party at our house, and
spilt the coffee on the new carpet; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) got so confused that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hardly did anything but sit in a corner and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tongue all
the rest of the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was so sorry for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'d done, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe,
in a gentle tone of reproach; she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was always faithful to Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and did I say she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) wasn't? but was there any need for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to be
stupid all the evening after?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you were rather sharp,--rather displeased--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think it my duty to be sharp, ay, and cross too, when I see
young folks careless. And when I see my duty clear, I do it; I'm not
one to shrink from it, and they ought to be grateful to me. It's
not every one that will take the trouble of reproving them, as Mrs.
Goodenough knows. I'm very fond of Molly Gibson, very, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own
sake and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mother's too; I'm not sure if I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s
worth half-a-dozen Cynthias, but for all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) shouldn't break my
best china teacup, and then sit doing nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) livelihood all
the rest of the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time Mrs. Goodenough gave evident signs of being tired;
Molly's misdemeanors and Miss Browning's broken teacup were not as
exciting subjects of conversation as Mrs. Gibson's newly-discovered
good luck in having a successful London lawyer for a relation.

<p/>Mr. Kirkpatrick had been, like many other men, struggling on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
profession, and encumbered with a large family of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) own; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was
ready to do a good turn for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) connections, if it occasioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) no
loss of time, and if -LRB-which was, perhaps, a primary condition-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
remembered their existence. Cynthia's visit to Doughty Street nine
or ten years ago had not made much impression upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) had
once suggested its feasibility to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) good-natured wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) was even
rather startled every now and then by the appearance of a pretty
little girl amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) own children, as they trooped in to dessert,
and had to remind himself who she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was. But as it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) custom
to leave the table almost immediately and to retreat into a small
back-room called his (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) study, to immerse himself in papers for the rest
of the evening, the child had not made much impression upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>); and
probably the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) existence was when Mrs.
Kirkpatrick wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) to receive Cynthia for a night on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) way to school at Boulogne. The same request was repeated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
return; but it so happened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) either time; and
only dimly remembered some remarks which his (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) wife had made on one of
these occasions, that it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rather hazardous to send so
young a girl so long a journey without making more provision for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
safety than Mrs. Kirkpatrick had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) wife would
fill up all deficiencies in this respect as if Cynthia had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
own daughter; and thought no more about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) received an
invitation to attend Mrs. Kirkpatrick's wedding with Mr. Gibson, the
highly-esteemed surgeon of Hollingford, &c. &c.--an attention which
irritated instead of pleasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Does the woman think I have
nothing to do but run about the country in search of brides and
bridegrooms, when this great case of Houghton _v._ Houghton is coming
on, and I haven't a moment to spare?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) asked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never heard of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kirkpatrick/Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>suggested Mrs. Kirkpatrick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! the case has been in the papers for days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mayn't know you are engaged in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mayn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), meditatively--such ignorance was possible.

<p/>But now the great case of Houghton _v._ Houghton was a thing of the
past; the hard struggle was over, the comparative table-land of Q.
C.-dom gained, and Mr. Kirkpatrick had leisure for family feeling and
recollection. One day in the Easter vacation he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) found himself near
Hollingford; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had a Sunday to spare, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) wrote to offer himself
as a visitor to the Gibsons from Friday till Monday, expressing
strongly -LRB-what he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) really felt, in a less degree,-RRB- his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) wish to make
Mr. Gibson's acquaintance. Mr. Gibson, though often overwhelmed with
professional business, was always hospitable; and moreover, it was
always a pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to get out of the somewhat confined mental
atmosphere which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had breathed over and over again, and have a
whiff of fresh air: a glimpse of what was passing in the great world
beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daily limits of thought and action. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was ready to
give a cordial welcome to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) unknown relation. Mrs. Gibson was
in a flutter of sentimental delight, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fancied was family
affection, but which might not have been quite so effervescent if Mr.
Kirkpatrick had remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) former position of struggling lawyer,
with seven children, living in Doughty Street.

<p/>When the two gentlemen met they were attracted towards each other
by a similarity of character, with just enough difference in their
opinions to make the experience of each, on which such opinions
were based, valuable to the other. To Mrs. Gibson, although the
bond between them counted for very little in their intercourse, Mr.
Kirkpatrick paid very polite attention; and was, in fact, very glad
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had done so well for herself as to marry a sensible and
agreeable man, who was able to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in comfort, and to behave
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter in so liberal a manner. Molly struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a
delicate-looking girl, who might be very pretty if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had a greater
look of health and animation: indeed, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) critically,
there were beautiful points about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face--long soft grey eyes,
black curling eyelashes, rarely-showing dimples, perfect teeth;
but there was a languor over all, a slow depression of manner,
which contrasted unfavourably with the brightly-coloured Cynthia,
sparkling, quick, graceful, and witty. As Mr. Kirkpatrick expressed
it afterwards to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was quite in love with that girl;
and Cynthia, as ready to captivate strangers as any little girl
of three or four, rose to the occasion, forgot all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cares and
despondencies, remembered no longer her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) regret at having lost
something of Mr. Gibson's good opinion, and listened eagerly and made
soft replies, intermixed with naïve sallies of droll humour, till
Mr. Kirkpatrick was quite captivated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) left Hollingford, almost
surprised to have performed a duty, and found it a pleasure. For Mrs.
Gibson and Molly he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had a general friendly feeling; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) did not
care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) never saw them again. But for Mr. Gibson he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had a warm
respect, a strong personal liking, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) should be glad to have
ripen into a friendship, if there was time for it in this bustling
world. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fully resolved to see more of Cynthia; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife must
know her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); they must have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up to stay with them in London, and show
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) something of the world. But, on returning home, Mr. Kirkpatrick
found so much work awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had to lock up embryo
friendships and kindly plans in some safe closet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) mind,
and give himself up, body and soul, to the immediate work of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
profession. But, in May, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) found time to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) wife to the
Academy Exhibition, and some portrait there striking him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) as being
like Cynthia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) wife more about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) visit to
Hollingford than he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had ever had leisure to do before; and the
result was that on the next day a letter was sent off to Mrs. Gibson,
inviting Cynthia to pay a visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cousins in London, and
reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) of many little circumstances that had occurred when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
was with them as a child, so as to carry on the clue of friendship
from that time to the present.

<p/>On its receipt, this letter was greeted in various ways by the four
people who sate round the breakfast-table. Mrs. Gibson read it to
herself first. Then, without telling what its contents were, so that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) auditors were quite in the dark as to what her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) remarks applied,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they might have remembered that I am a generation nearer to
them than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is, but nobody thinks of family affection now-a days;
and I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so much, and bought a new cookery-book, all to make
it pleasant and agreeable and what he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was used to.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said all this
in a plaintive, aggrieved tone of voice; but as no one knew to what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was referring, it was difficult to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) consolation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
husband was the first to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want us to sympathize with you, tell us what is the nature of
your woe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I daresay it's what he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) means as a very kind attention, only I
think I ought to have been asked before Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), reading
the letter over again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's _he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)_? and what's meant for a `kind attention'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Kirkpatrick, to be sure. This letter is from him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) wants
Cynthia to go and pay them a visit, and never says anything about you
or me, my dear. And I'm sure we did our best to make it pleasant; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) should have asked us first, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I couldn't possibly have gone, it makes very little difference to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I could have gone; and, at any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) should have paid us
the compliment: it's only a proper mark of respect, you know. So
ungrateful, too, when I gave up my dressing-room on purpose for him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I dressed for dinner every day he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was here, if we are each to
recapitulate all our sacrifices on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) behalf. But, for all that, I
didn't expect to be invited to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) house. I shall be only too glad if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) will come again to mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a great mind not to let Cynthia go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson
reflectively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't go, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, colouring. <div class="bookquote">``My gowns are all so
shabby, and my old bonnet must do for the summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but you can buy a new one; and I'm sure it is high time you
should get yourself another silk gown. You must have been saving up a
great deal, for I don't know when you've had any new clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia began to say something, but stopped short. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went on
buttering her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) toast, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) held it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand without eating it;
without looking up either, as, after a minute or two of silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
spoke again:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot go. I should like it very much; but I really cannot go.
Please, mamma, write at once, and refuse it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, child! When a man in Mr. Kirkpatrick's position comes
forward to offer a favour, it does not do to decline it without
giving a sufficient reason. So kind of him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) as it is, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose you offer to go instead of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>proposed Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! that won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``You can't
transfer invitations in that way. But, really, this excuse about your
clothes does appear to be very trivial, Cynthia, if you have no other
reason to give.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a real, true reason to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``You must let me judge for myself. It would not do
to go there in a state of shabbiness, for even in Doughty Street,
I remember, my aunt was very particular about dress; and now that

say anything more about it, for I know it would not do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you done with all your money, I wonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson.
<div class="bookquote">``You've twenty pounds a year, thanks to Mr. Gibson and me; and I'm
sure you haven't spent more than ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't many things when I came back from France,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, in
a low voice, and evidently troubled by all this questioning. <div class="bookquote">``Pray
let it be decided at once; I can't go, and there's an end of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
got up, and left the room rather suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``Do you, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) doesn't like spending money on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dress, and is very
careful.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly said this much, and then was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had made
mischief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must have got the money somewhere. It always has struck
me that if you have not extravagant habits, and do not live up to
your income, you must have a certain sum to lay by at the end of the
year. Have I not often said so, Mr. Gibson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, apply the same reasoning to Cynthia's case; and then, I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was appealed to. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
may have given it away to some one who wants it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) newspaper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has neither got the dress nor the money
necessary for this London visit, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) doesn't want any more
inquiries to be made on the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) likes mysteries, in fact,
and I detest them. Still, I think it's a desirable thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to
keep up the acquaintance, or friendship, or whatever it is to be
called, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) father's family; and I shall gladly give her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ten
pounds; and if that's not enough, why, either you must help her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) out,
or she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) must do without some superfluous article of dress or another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure there never was such a kind, dear, generous man as you are,
Mr. Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``To think of your being a stepfather!
and so good to my poor fatherless girl! But, Molly my dear, I
think you'll acknowledge that you too are very fortunate in your
stepmother. Are not you, love? And what happy _tête-à-têtes_ we shall
have together when Cynthia goes to London! I'm not sure if I don't
get on better with you even than with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is my own
child; for, as dear papa says so truly, there is a love of mystery
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); and if I hate anything, it is the slightest concealment
or reserve. Ten pounds! Why, it will quite set her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) up, buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) a
couple of gowns and a new bonnet, and I don't know what all! Dear Mr.
Gibson, how generous you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Something very like <div class="bookquote">``Pshaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was growled out from behind the
newspaper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, rising up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, do, love. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) it would be so ungrateful to refuse; and
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) that your father wishes her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to go; and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), too, that
it would be quite wrong not to avail herself of an opening which may
by-and-by be extended to the rest of the family. I am sure if they
ask me--which certainly they ought to do--I won't say before they
asked Cynthia, because I never think of myself, and am really the
most forgiving person in the world, in forgiving slights;--but when
they do ask me, which they are sure to do, I shall never be content
till, by putting in a little hint here and a little hint there, I've
induced them to send you an invitation. A month or two in London
would do you so much good, Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had left the room before this speech was ended, and Mr. Gibson
was occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) newspaper; but Mrs. Gibson finished it to
herself very much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own satisfaction; for, after all, it was
better to have some one of the family going on the visit, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
might not be the right person, than to refuse it altogether, and
never to have the opportunity of saying anything about it. As Mr.
Gibson was so kind to Cynthia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) too would be kind to Molly, and
dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) becomingly, and invite young men to the house; do all
the things, in fact, which Molly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father did not want to
have done, and throw the old stumbling-blocks in the way of their
unrestrained intercourse, which was the one thing they desired to
have, free and open, and without the constant dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) jealousy.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX.

<p/>SECRET THOUGHTS OOZE OUT.


<p/>Molly found Cynthia in the drawing-room, standing in the bow-window,
looking out on the garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) started as Molly came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms out towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am always
so glad to have you with me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It was outbursts of affection such as these that always called
Molly back, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been ever so unconsciously wavering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
allegiance to Cynthia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had been wishing downstairs that Cynthia
would be less reserved, and not have so many secrets; but now it
seemed almost like treason to have wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to be anything but what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was. Never had any one more than Cynthia the power spoken of by
Goldsmith when he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsmith</b></font>) wrote--

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsmith</b></font>) threw off his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsmith</b></font>) friends like a huntsman his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsmith</b></font>) pack,
For he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsmith</b></font>) knew when he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsmith</b></font>) liked he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsmith</b></font>) could whistle them back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I think you'll be glad to hear what I've got to tell
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I think you would really like to go to London;
shouldn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but it's of no use liking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you begin
about it, Molly, for the thing is settled; and I can't tell you why,
but I can't go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only the money, dear. And papa has been so kind about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
wants you to go; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) thinks you ought to keep up relationships; and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
is going to give you ten pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How kind he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``But I ought not to take it. I wish I
had known you years ago; I should have been different to what I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that! We like you as you are; we don't want you
different. You'll really hurt papa if you don't take it. Why do you
hesitate? Do you think Roger won't like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger! no, I wasn't thinking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)! Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) care? I shall
be there and back again before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) even hears about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you will go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/>Cynthia thought for a minute or two. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), at
length. <div class="bookquote">``I daresay it's not wise; but it will be pleasant, and I'll
go. Where is Mr. Gibson? I want to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). Oh, how kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is!
Molly, you're a lucky girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, quite startled at being told this; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been
feeling as if so many things were going wrong, almost as if they
would never go right again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``I hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in the hall!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And down
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) flew, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hands on Mr. Gibson's arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thanked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with such warm impulsiveness, and in so pretty and caressing a
manner, that something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) old feeling of personal liking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
returned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) forgot for a time the causes of disapproval he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that's enough, my dear! It's quite right
you should keep up with your relations; there's nothing more to be
said about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think your father is the most charming man I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said
Cynthia, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) return to Molly; <div class="bookquote">``and it's that which always makes
me so afraid of losing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good opinion, and fret so when I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
is displeased with me. And now let us think all about this London
visit. It will be delightful, won't it? I can make ten pounds go ever
so far; and in some ways it will be such a comfort to get out of
Hollingford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, rather wistfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! You know I don't mean that it will be a comfort to leave
you; that will be anything but a comfort. But, after all, a country
town is a country town, and London is London. You need not smile at
my truisms; I've always had a sympathy with M. de la Palisse,--

<p/>M. de la Palisse est mort
En perdant sa vie;
Un quart d'heure avant sa mort
Il était en vie,''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>sang she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), in so gay a manner that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) puzzled Molly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) often
did, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) change of mood from the gloomy decision with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had refused to accept the invitation only half an hour ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
suddenly took Molly round the waist, and began waltzing round the
room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), to the imminent danger of the various little tables,
loaded with <div class="bookquote">''_objets d'art_''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as Mrs. Gibson delighted to call them-RRB-
with which the drawing-room was crowded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) avoided them, however,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usual skill; but they both stood still at last, surprised
at Mrs. Gibson's surprise, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stood at the door, looking at the
whirl going on before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I only hope you are not going crazy, both of you!
What's all this about, pray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only because I'm so glad I'm going to London, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia,
demurely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure if it's quite the thing for an engaged young lady to
be so much beside herself at the prospect of gaiety. In my time, our
great pleasure in our lovers' absence was in thinking about them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought that would have given you pain, because you
would have had to remember that they were away, which ought to have
made you unhappy. Now, to tell you the truth, just at the moment I
had forgotten all about Roger. I hope it wasn't very wrong. Osborne
looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did all my share as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own of the fretting
after Roger. How ill he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) looked yesterday!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know if any one besides me had noticed
it. I was quite shocked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid that young man won't live
long--very much afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head ominously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what will happen if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Molly, suddenly sitting
down, and thinking of that strange, mysterious wife who never made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) appearance, whose very existence was never spoken about--and
Roger away too!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it would be very sad, of course, and we should all feel it
very much, I've no doubt; for I've always been very fond of Osborne;
in fact, before Roger became, as it were, my own flesh and blood, I
liked Osborne better: but we must not forget the living, dear Molly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for Molly's eyes were filling with tears at the dismal thoughts
presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Our dear good Roger would, I am sure, do all in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) power to fill Osborne's place in every way; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) marriage need
not be so long delayed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of that in the same breath as Osborne's life, mamma,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear, it is a very natural thought. For poor Roger's sake,
you know, one wishes it not to be so very, very long an engagement;
and I was only answering Molly's question, after all. One can't help
following out one's thoughts. People must die, you know--young, as
well as old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I ever suspected Roger of following out his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thoughts in a similar
way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, <div class="bookquote">``I'd never speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, warm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) turn. <div class="bookquote">``You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) never
would; and you shouldn't suppose it of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), Cynthia--no, not even for
a moment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see the great harm of it all, for my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gibson, plaintively. <div class="bookquote">``A young man strikes us all as looking very
ill--and I'm sure I'm sorry for it; but illness very often leads to
death. Surely you agree with me there, and what's the harm of saying
so? Then Molly asks what will happen if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dies; and I try to answer
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) question. I don't like talking or thinking of death any more than
any one else; but I should think myself wanting in strength of mind
if I could not look forward to the consequences of death. I really
think we're commanded to do so, somewhere in the Bible or the
Prayer-book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you look forward to the consequences of my death, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>asked
Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You really are the most unfeeling girl I ever met with,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gibson, really hurt. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I could give you a little of my own
sensitiveness, for I have too much for my happiness. Don't let us
speak of Osborne's looks again; ten to one it was only some temporary
over-fatigue, or some anxiety about Roger, or perhaps a little fit
of indigestion. I was very foolish to attribute it to anything more
serious, and dear papa might be displeased if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) knew I had done
so. Medical men don't like other people to be making conjectures
about health; they consider it as trenching on their own particular
province, and very proper, I'm sure. Now let us consider about your
dress, Cynthia; I could not understand how you had spent your money,
and made so little show with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma! it may sound very cross, but I must tell Molly, and you, and
everybody, once for all, that as I don't want and didn't ask for more
than my allowance, I'm not going to answer any questions about what
I do with it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not say this with any want of respect; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
said it with quiet determination, which subdued her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mother for the
time; though often afterwards, when Mrs. Gibson and Molly were alone,
the former would start the wonder as to what Cynthia could possibly
have done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) money, and hunt each poor conjecture through woods
and valleys of doubt, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was wearied out; and the exciting
sport was given up for the day. At present, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) confined
herself to the practical matter in hand; and the genius for millinery
and dress, inherent in both mother and daughter, soon settled a great
many knotty points of contrivance and taste, and then they all three
set to work to <div class="bookquote">``gar auld claes look amaist as weel's the new.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia's relations with the Squire had been very stationary ever
since the visit she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had paid to the Hall the previous autumn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
received them all at that time with hospitable politeness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
had been more charmed with Cynthia than he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) liked to acknowledge to
himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought the visit all over afterwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s a pretty lass, sure enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and has pretty ways
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) too, and likes to learn from older people, which is a good
sign; but somehow I don't like madam her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
mother, and the girl's her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) daughter; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) once or
twice as I shouldn't ha' liked our little Fanny to have spoken, if
it had pleased God for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to ha' lived. No, it's not the right way,
and it may be a bit old-fashioned, but I like the right way. And then
again she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) took possession o' me, as I may say, and little Molly had
to run after us in the garden walks that are too narrow for three,
just like a little four-legged doggie; and the other was so full of
listening to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) never turned round for to speak a word to Molly.
I don't mean to say they're not fond of each other, and that's in
Roger's sweetheart's favour; and it's very ungrateful in me to go and
find fault with a lass who was so civil to me, and had such a pretty
way with her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) of hanging on every word that fell from my lips. Well!
a deal may come and go in two years! and the lad says nothing to me
about it. I'll be as deep as him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), and take no more notice of the
affair till he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) comes home and tells me himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So although the Squire was always delighted to receive the little
notes which Cynthia sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) heard from Roger, and
although this attention on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) part was melting the heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tried
to harden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) controlled himself into writing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) the briefest
acknowledgments. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) words were strong in meaning, but formal
in expression; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) herself did not think much about them, being
satisfied to do the kind actions that called them forth. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
mother criticised them and pondered them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had hit
on the truth when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) decided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own mind that it was a very
old-fashioned style, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) house and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) furniture
all wanted some of the brightening up and polishing which they were
sure to receive, when--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) never quite liked to finish the sentence
definitely, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) kept repeating to herself that <div class="bookquote">``there was no
harm in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To return to the Squire. Occupied as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) now was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
former health, and something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) former cheerfulness. If Osborne
had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) half-way, it is probable that the old bond between father
and son might have been renewed; but Osborne either was really an
invalid, or had sunk into invalid habits, and made no effort to
rally. If his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father urged him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to go out--nay, once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
gulped down his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pride, and asked Osborne to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)--Osborne
would go to the window and find out some flaw or speck in the wind
or weather, and make that an excuse for stopping in-doors over his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
books. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would saunter out on the sunny side of the house in a
manner that the Squire considered as both indolent and unmanly. Yet
if there was a prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) leaving home, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did pretty
often about this time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was seized with a hectic energy: the clouds
in the sky, the easterly wind, the dampness of the air, were nothing
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) then; and as the Squire did not know the real secret cause
of this anxiety to be gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) head that it arose
from Osborne's dislike to Hamley and to the monotony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father's
society.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>thought the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``I see it now. I was never
great at making friends myself: I always thought those Oxford and
Cambridge men turned up their noses at me for a country booby, and
I'd get the start and have none o' them. But when the boys went to
Rugby and Cambridge, I should ha' let them have had their own friends
about 'em, even though they might ha' looked down on me; it was the
worst they could ha' done to me; and now what few friends I had have
fallen off from me, by death or somehow, and it is but dreary work
for a young man, I grant it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might try not to show it so plain
to me as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does. I'm getting case-hardened, but it does cut me to
the quick sometimes--it does. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dad as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
once! If I can but get the land drained I'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an allowance,
and let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go to London, or where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll do better
this time, or maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll go to the dogs altogether; but perhaps it
will make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) think a bit kindly of the old father at home--I should
like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do that, I should!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>It is possible that Osborne might have been induced to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
father of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) marriage during their long solitary intercourse, if the
Squire, in an unlucky moment, had not given him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) confidence about
Roger's engagement with Cynthia. It was on one wet Sunday afternoon,
when the father and son were sitting together in the large empty
drawing-room. Osborne had not been to church in the morning; the
Squire had, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was now trying hard to read one of Blair's
sermons. They had dined early; they always did on Sundays; and either
that, or the sermon, or the hopeless wetness of the day, made the
afternoon seem interminably long to the Squire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had certain
unwritten rules for the regulation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) conduct on Sundays. Cold
meat, sermon-reading, no smoking till after evening prayers, as
little thought as possible as to the state of the land and the
condition of the crops, and as much respectable sitting in-doors in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) best clothes as was consistent with going to church twice a day,
and saying the responses louder than the clerk. To-day it had rained
so unceasingly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had remitted the afternoon church; but oh,
even with the luxury of a nap, how long it seemed before he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) saw the
Hall servants trudging homewards, along the field-path, a covey of
umbrellas! He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been standing at the window for the last half-hour,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) pockets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mouth often contracting itself into
the traditional sin of a whistle, but as often checked into sudden
gravity--ending, nine times out of ten, in a yawn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) looked askance
at Osborne, who was sitting near the fire absorbed in a book. The
poor Squire was something like the little boy in the child's story,
who asks all sorts of birds and beasts to come and play with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>);
and, in every case, receives the sober answer, that they are too busy
to have leisure for trivial amusements. The father wanted the son to
put down his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) book, and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>): it was so wet, so dull, and a
little conversation would so wile away the time! But Osborne, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back to the window where his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father was standing, saw nothing
of all this, and went on reading. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had assented to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's
remark that it was a very wet afternoon, but had not carried on the
subject into all the varieties of truisms of which it was susceptible.
Something more rousing must be started, and this the Squire felt. The
recollection of the affair between Roger and Cynthia came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
head, and, without giving it a moment's consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) began,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne! Do you know anything about this--this attachment of
Roger's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Quite successful. Osborne laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) book in a moment, and turned
round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger! an attachment! No! I never heard of it--I can hardly believe
it--that is to say, I suppose it is to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) stopped; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had no right to betray his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own
conjecture that the object was Cynthia Kirkpatrick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is though. Can you guess who to? Nobody that I particularly
like--not a connection to my mind--yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)'s a very pretty girl; and
I suppose I was to blame in the first instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use beating about the bush. I've gone so far, I may as well
tell you all. It's Miss Kirkpatrick, Gibson's stepdaughter. But it's
not an engagement, mind you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad--I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) likes Roger back again--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like--it's only too good a connection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) not to like it: if
Roger is of the same mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) comes home, I'll be bound she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)'ll be
only too happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder Roger never told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, a little hurt, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
began to consider himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) never told me either,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``It was Gibson, who came
here, and made a clean breast of it, like a man of honour. I'd been
saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I couldn't have either of you two lads taking up with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lasses. I'll own it was you I was afraid of--it's bad enough with
Roger, and maybe will come to nothing after all; but if it had been
you, I'd ha' broken with Gibson and every mother's son of 'em, sooner
than have let it go on; and so I told Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon for interrupting you, but, once for all, I claim
the right of choosing my wife for myself, subject to no man's
interference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, hotly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'll keep your wife with no man's interference, that's all;
for ne'er a penny will you get from me, my lad, unless you marry to
please me a little, as well as yourself a great deal. That's all I
ask of you. I'm not particular as to beauty, or as to cleverness, and
piano-playing, and that sort of thing; if Roger marries this girl, we
shall have enough of that in the family. I shouldn't much mind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
being a bit older than you, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be well-born, and the more
money she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brings the better for the old place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say again, father, I choose my wife for myself, and I don't admit
any man's right of dictation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, getting a little angry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) turn.
<div class="bookquote">``If I'm not to be father in this matter, thou sha'n't be son. Go
against me in what I've set my heart on, and you'll find there's the
devil to pay, that's all. But don't let us get angry, it's Sunday
afternoon for one thing, and it's a sin; and besides that, I've not
finished my story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>For Osborne had taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) book again, and under pretence of
reading, was fuming to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hardly put it away even at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
father's request.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I was saying, Gibson said, when first we spoke about it, that
there was nothing on foot between any of you four, and that if there
was, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) would let me know; so by-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) comes and tells me of
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what--I don't understand how far it has gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a tone in Osborne's voice the Squire did not quite like;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) began answering rather angrily.

<p/>``Of this, to be sure--of what I'm telling you--of Roger going and
making love to this girl, that day he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) left, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had gone away
from here, and was waiting for the <div class="bookquote">``Umpire' in Hollingford. One would
think you quite stupid at times, Osborne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only say that these details are quite new to me; you never
mentioned them before, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; never mind whether I did or not. I'm sure I said Roger was
attached to Miss Kirkpatrick, and be hanged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>); and you might
have understood all the rest as a matter of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, politely. <div class="bookquote">``May I ask if Miss Kirkpatrick,
who appeared to me to be a very nice girl, responds to Roger's
affection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fast enough, I'll be bound,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, sulkily. <div class="bookquote">``A Hamley of
Hamley isn't to be had every day. Now, I'll tell you what, Osborne,
you're the only marriageable one left in the market, and I want to
hoist the old family up again. Don't go against me in this; it really
will break my heart if you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, don't talk so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne. <div class="bookquote">``I'll do anything I can to
oblige you, except--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except the only thing I've set my heart on your doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, let it alone for the present. There's no question of my
marrying just at this moment. I'm out of health, and I'm not up to
going into society, and meeting young ladies and all that sort of
thing, even if I had an opening into fitting society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have an opening fast enough. There'll be more money
coming in, in a year or two, please God. And as for your health, why,
what's to make you well, if you cower over the fire all day, and
shudder away from a good honest tankard as if it were poison?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, languidly, playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) book as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wanted to end the conversation and take it up again. The Squire
saw the movements, and understood them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'll go and have a talk with Will about poor old
Black Bess. It's Sunday work enough, asking after a dumb animal's
aches and pains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But after his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father had left the room Osborne did not take up his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
book again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) laid it down on the table by him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), leant back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
chair, and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was in a state of
health which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) despondent about many things, though, least
of all, about what was most in danger. The long concealment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
marriage from his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father made the disclosure of it far, far more
difficult than it would have been at first. Unsupported by Roger, how
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) explain it all to one so passionate as the Squire? how tell
of the temptation, the stolen marriage, the consequent happiness, and
alas! the consequent suffering?--for Osborne had suffered, and did
suffer, greatly in the untoward circumstances in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had placed
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) saw no way out of it all, excepting by the one strong
stroke of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) felt himself incapable. So with a heavy heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
addressed himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) book again. Everything seemed to come in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was not strong enough in character to overcome obstacles.
The only overt step he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took in consequence of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had heard from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father, was to ride over to Hollingford the first fine day after
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had received the news, and go to see Cynthia and the Gibsons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
had not been there for a long time; bad weather and languor combined
had prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) found them full of preparations and discussions
about Cynthia's visit to London; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) herself not at all in
the sentimental mood proper to respond to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) delicate intimations
of how glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) brother's joy. Indeed, it was so long
after the time, that Cynthia scarcely perceived that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) the
intelligence was recent, and that the first bloom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) emotions
had not yet passed away. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head a little on one side,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was contemplating the effect of a knot of ribbons, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
began, in a low whisper, and leaning forward towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
spoke,--<div class="bookquote">``Cynthia--I may call you Cynthia now, mayn't I?--I'm so glad
of this news; I've only just heard of it, but I'm so glad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What news do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) suspicions; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was annoyed
to think that from one person her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) secret was passing to another and
another, till, in fact, it was becoming no secret at all. Still,
Cynthia could always conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) annoyance when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) chose. <div class="bookquote">``Why are
you to begin calling me Cynthia now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went on, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``The
terrible word has slipped out from between your lips before, do you
know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>This light way of taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tender congratulation did not quite
please Osborne, who was in a sentimental mood, and for a minute or so
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) remained silent. Then, having finished making her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) bow of ribbon,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and continued in a quick low voice, anxious to
take advantage of a conversation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) mother and Molly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I can guess why you made that pretty little speech just
now. But do you know you ought not to have been told? And, moreover,
things are not quite arrived at the solemnity of--of--well--an
engagement. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would not have it so. Now, I sha'n't say any more; and
you must not. Pray remember you ought not to have known; it is my
own secret, and I particularly wished it not to be spoken about; and
I don't like its being so talked about. Oh, the leaking of water
through one small hole!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) plunged into the talk of the other two, making the
conversation general. Osborne was rather discomfited at the
non-success of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) congratulations; he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had pictured to himself the
unbosoming of a love-sick girl, full of rapture, and glad of a
sympathizing confidant. He (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>) little knew Cynthia's nature. The more she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
suspected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was called upon for a display of emotion, the less
would she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) show; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) emotions were generally under the control of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>) had made an effort to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); and now he (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>) leant
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>) chair, weary and a little dispirited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You poor dear young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>confidant</b></font>) with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) soft, soothing manner; ``how tired you look! Do take some of that
eau-de-Cologne and bathe your forehead. This spring weather overcomes
me too. <div class="bookquote">``Primavera' I think the Italians call it. But it is very
trying for delicate constitutions, as much from its associations as
from its variableness of temperature. It makes me sigh perpetually;
but then I am so sensitive. Dear Lady Cumnor always used to say I was
like a thermometer. You've heard how ill she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, not very much caring either.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is better now; but the anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has tried me
so: detained here by what are, of course, my duties, but far away
from all intelligence, and not knowing what the next post might
bring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>asked Osborne, becoming a little more
sympathetic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At Spa. Such a distance off! Three days' post! Can't you conceive
the trial? Living with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) as I did for years; bound up in the family
as I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Lady Harriet said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) last letter, that they hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would
be stronger than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been for years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, innocently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--Lady Harriet--of course--every one who knows Lady Harriet knows
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is of too sanguine a temperament for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) statements to be
perfectly relied on. Altogether--strangers are often deluded by Lady
Harriet--she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has an off-hand manner which takes them in; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does
not mean half she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does in this instance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, shortly.
<div class="bookquote">``They're in London now, and Lady Cumnor hasn't suffered from the
journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head, and laying an
emphasis on the word <div class="bookquote">``say.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am perhaps over-anxious, but I wish--I
wish I could see and judge for myself. It would be the only way of
calming my anxiety. I almost think I shall go up with you, Cynthia,
for a day or two, just to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) with my own eyes. I don't quite
like your travelling alone either. We will think about it, and you
shall write to Mr. Kirkpatrick, and propose it, if we determine upon
it. You can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) of my anxiety; and it will be only sharing your
bed for a couple of nights.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XL.

<p/>MOLLY GIBSON BREATHES FREELY.


<p/>That was the way in which Mrs. Gibson first broached her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) intention
of accompanying Cynthia up to London for a few days' visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
a trick of producing the first sketch of any new plan before an
outsider to the family circle; so that the first emotions of others,
if they disapproved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) projects, had to be repressed, until the
idea had become familiar to them. To Molly it seemed too charming
a proposal ever to come to pass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had never allowed herself to
recognize the restraint she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was under in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother's presence;
but all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found it out when her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart danced at the idea
of three whole days--for that it would be at the least--of perfect
freedom of intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father; of old times come back again;
of meals without perpetual fidgetiness after details of ceremony and
correctness of attendance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll have bread-and-cheese for dinner, and eat it on our knees;
we'll make up for having had to eat sloppy puddings with a fork
instead of a spoon all this time, by putting our knives in our mouths
till we cut ourselves. Papa shall pour his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) tea into his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) saucer if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'s in a hurry; and if I'm thirsty, I'll take the slop-basin. And
oh, if I could but get, buy, borrow, or steal any kind of an old
horse; my grey skirt isn't new, but it will do;--that would be too
delightful! After all, I think I can be happy again; for months and
months it has seemed as if I had got too old ever to feel pleasure,
much less happiness again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So thought Molly. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) blushed, as if with guilt, when Cynthia,
reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thoughts, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) one day,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, you're very glad to get rid of us, are not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not of you, Cynthia; at least, I don't think I am. Only, if you but
knew how I love papa, and how I used to see a great deal more of him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
than I ever do now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I often think what interlopers we must seem, and are in fact--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel you as such. You, at any rate, have been a new delight
to me--a sister; and I never knew how charming such a relationship
could be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, half-suspiciously, half-sorrowfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is papa's wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to say I'm
not often very sorry to feel I'm no longer first with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); but it
was'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--the violent colour flushed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face till even her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes
burnt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) suddenly found herself on the point of crying; the
weeping ash-tree, the misery, the slow dropping comfort, and the
comforter came all so vividly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``it was Roger!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went
on looking up at Cynthia, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) slight hesitation at
mentioning his (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) name--<div class="bookquote">``Roger, who told me how I ought to take papa's
marriage, when I was first startled and grieved at the news. Oh,
Cynthia, what a great thing it is to be loved by him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia blushed, and looked fluttered and pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose it is. At the same time, Molly, I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll
expect me to be always as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) fancies me now, and I shall have
to walk on tiptoe all the rest of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are good, Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly</b></font>)</div>put in Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not. You're just as much mistaken as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is; and some day I
shall go down in your opinions with a run, just like the hall clock
the other day when the spring broke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll love you just as much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you? Would you be my friend if--if it turned out ever that I
had done very wrong things? Would you remember how very difficult it
has sometimes been to me to act rightly?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took hold of Molly's
hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``We won't speak of mamma, for your sake as much
as mine or hers; but you must see she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) isn't one to help a girl with
much good advice, or good-- Oh, Molly, you don't know how I was
neglected just at a time when I wanted friends most. Mamma does not
know it; it is not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to know what I might have been if I had
only fallen into wise, good hands. But I know it; and what's more,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), suddenly ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) unusual exhibition of feeling,
<div class="bookquote">``I try not to care, which I daresay is really the worst of all; but I
could worry myself to death if I once took to serious thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could help you, or even understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, after
a moment or two of sad perplexity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) manner abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``I can
trim bonnets, and make head-dresses; but somehow my hands can't fold
up gowns and collars, like your deft little fingers. Please will
you help me to pack? That's a real, tangible piece of kindness, and
not sentimental consolation for sentimental distresses, which are,
perhaps, imaginary after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people travellers</b></font>)</div><p/>In general, it is the people that are left behind stationary, who
give way to low spirits at any parting; the travellers, however
bitterly they may feel the separation, find something in the change
of scene to soften regret in the very first hour of separation. But
as Molly walked home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father from seeing Mrs. Gibson and
Cynthia off to London by the <div class="bookquote">``Umpire''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>coach, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) almost danced along
the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to have you all to myself for a
whole week. You must be very obedient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be tyrannical, then. You're walking me out of breath, and
we're cutting Mrs. Goodenough, in our hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div><p/>So they crossed over the street to speak to Mrs. Goodenough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've just been seeing my wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter off to London. Mrs.
Gibson has gone up for a week!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Deary, deary, to London, and only for a week! Why, I can remember
its being a three days' journey! It'll be very lonesome for you, Miss
Molly, without your young companion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, suddenly feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ought to have taken
this view of the case. <div class="bookquote">``I shall miss Cynthia very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, Mr. Gibson; why, it'll be like being a widower over again!
You must come and drink tea with me some evening. We must try and
cheer you up a bit amongst us. Shall it be Tuesday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of the sharp pinch which Molly gave to his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) arm, Mr. Gibson
accepted the invitation, much to the gratification of the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, how could you go and waste one of our evenings! We have but
six in all, and now but five; and I had so reckoned on our doing all
sorts of things together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know: everything that is unrefined and ungenteel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), slily looking up into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father's face.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes twinkled, but the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face was perfectly grave. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
not going to be corrupted. With toil and labour I've reached a very
fair height of refinement. I won't be pulled down again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you will, papa. We'll have bread-and-cheese for lunch this
very day. And you shall wear your slippers in the drawing-room every
evening you'll stay quietly at home; and oh, papa, don't you think I
could ride Nora Creina? I've been looking out the old grey skirt, and
I think I could make myself tidy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the side-saddle to come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, the old one won't fit that great Irish mare. But I'm not
particular, papa. I think I could manage somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. But I'm not quite going to return into barbarism. It may
be a depraved taste, but I should like to see my daughter properly
mounted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of riding together down the lanes--why, the dog-roses must be
all out in flower, and the honeysuckles, and the hay--how I should
like to see Merriman's farm again! Papa, do let me have one ride with
you! Please do. I'm sure we can manage it somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And <div class="bookquote">``somehow''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it was managed. <div class="bookquote">``Somehow''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>all Molly's wishes came to
pass; there was only one little drawback to this week of holiday and
happy intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father. Everybody would ask them out to
tea. They were quite like bride and bridegroom; for the fact was,
that the late dinners which Mrs. Gibson had introduced into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own
house, were a great inconvenience in the calculations of the small
tea-drinkings at Hollingford. How ask people to tea at six, who dined
at that hour? How, when they refused cake and sandwiches at half-past
eight, how induce other people who were really hungry to commit a
vulgarity before those calm and scornful eyes? So there had been a
great lull of invitations for the Gibsons to Hollingford tea-parties.
Mrs. Gibson, whose object was to squeeze herself into <div class="bookquote">``county
society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>had taken this being left out of the smaller festivities
with great equanimity; but Molly missed the kind homeliness of the
parties to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had gone from time to time as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could
remember; and though, as each three-cornered note was brought in,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) grumbled a little over the loss of another charming evening
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) really was glad to go again in the old way
among old friends. Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe were especially
compassionate towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) loneliness. If they had had their
will she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) would have dined there every day; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) had to call upon
them very frequently in order to prevent their being hurt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)
declining the dinners. Mrs. Gibson wrote twice during her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) week's
absence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband. That piece of news was quite satisfactory
to the Miss Brownings, who had of late held themselves a great deal
aloof from a house where they chose to suppose that their presence
was not wanted. In their winter evenings they had often talked over
Mr. Gibson's household, and having little besides conjecture to go
upon, they found the subject interminable, as they could vary the
possibilities every day. One of their wonders was how Mr. and Mrs.
Gibson really got on together; another was whether Mrs. Gibson was
extravagant or not. Now two letters during the week of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) absence
showed what was in those days considered a very proper amount of
conjugal affection. Yet not too much--at elevenpence-halfpenny
postage. A third letter would have been extravagant. Sister looked to
sister with an approving nod as Molly named the second letter, which
arrived in Hollingford the very day before Mrs. Gibson was to return.
They had settled between themselves that two letters would show the
right amount of good feeling and proper understanding in the Gibson
family: more would have been extravagant; only one would have been
a mere matter of duty. There had been rather a question between
Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe as to which person the second letter
-LRB-supposing it came-RRB- was to be addressed to. It would be very conjugal
to write twice to Mr. Gibson; and yet it would be very pretty if
Molly came in for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) share.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've had another letter, you say, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Browning.
<div class="bookquote">``I daresay Mrs. Gibson has written to you this time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a large sheet, and Cynthia has written on one half to me, and
all the rest is to papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very nice arrangement, I'm sure. And what does Cynthia say? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
enjoying herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I think so. They've had a dinner-party; and one night,
when mamma was at Lady Cumnor's, Cynthia went to the play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
cousins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word! and all in one week? I do call that dissipation. Why,
Thursday would be taken up with the journey, and Friday with resting,
and Sunday is Sunday all the world over; and they must have written
on Tuesday. Well! I hope Cynthia won't find Hollingford dull, that's
all, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) comes back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it's likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe, with a little simper
and a knowing look, which sate oddly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) kindly innocent face.
<div class="bookquote">``You see a great deal of Mr. Preston, don't you, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Preston!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, flushing up with surprise. <div class="bookquote">``No! not much.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s been at Ashcombe all winter, you know! He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) has but just come back
to settle here. What should make you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! a little bird told us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning. Molly knew that
little bird from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) childhood, and had always hated it, and longed
to wring its neck. Why could not people speak out and say that they
did not mean to give up the name of their informant? But it was a
very favourite form of fiction with the Miss Brownings, and to Miss
Phoebe it was the very acme of wit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The little bird was flying about one day in Heath Lane, and it saw
Mr. Preston and a young lady--we won't say who--walking together in
a very friendly manner, that is to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was on horseback; but the
path is raised above the road, just where there is the little wooden
bridge over the brook--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Molly is in the secret, and we ought not to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) about
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe, seeing Molly's extreme discomfiture and
annoyance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can be no great secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, dropping the
little-bird formula, and assuming an air of dignified reproval at
Miss Phoebe's interruption, <div class="bookquote">``for Miss Hornblower says Mr. Preston
owns to being engaged--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate it isn't to Cynthia, that I know positively,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Molly
with some vehemence. <div class="bookquote">``And pray put a stop to any such reports; you
don't know what mischief they may do. I do so hate that kind of
chatter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>It was not very respectful of Molly to speak in this way
to be sure, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought only of Roger; and the distress any such
reports might cause, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ever hear of them -LRB-in the centre of
Africa!-RRB- made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) colour up scarlet with vexation.

<p/>``Heighty-teighty! Miss Molly! don't you remember that I am old enough
to be your mother, and that it is not pretty behaviour to speak so to
us--to me! <div class="bookquote">``Chatter' to be sure. Really, Molly--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, only half-penitent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay you did not mean to speak so to sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Phoebe, trying to make peace.

<p/>Molly did not answer all at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wanted to explain how much
mischief might be done by such reports.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went on, still flushed by vexation, <div class="bookquote">``how
bad it is to talk of such things in such a way? Supposing one of
them cared for some one else, and that might happen, you know; Mr.
Preston, for instance, may be engaged to some one else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly! I pity the woman! Indeed I do. I have a very poor opinion of
Mr. Preston,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, in a warning tone of voice; for a
new idea had come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but the woman, or young lady, would not like to hear such
reports about Mr. Preston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. But for all that, take my word for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s a great
flirt, and young ladies had better not have much to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay it was all accident their meeting in Heath Lane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Phoebe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``and I daresay I have been
impertinent, only please don't talk about it any more. I have my
reasons for asking you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) got up, for by the striking of the
church clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had just found out that it was later than she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father would be at home by this time.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bent down and kissed Miss Browning's grave and passive face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How you are growing, Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe, anxious to cover
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister's displeasure. <div class="bookquote">''`As tall and as straight as a
poplar-tree!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>as the old song says.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grow in grace, Molly, as well as in good looks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning,
watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) out of the room. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) was fairly gone, Miss
Browning got up and shut the door quite securely, and then sitting
down near her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) said, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Phoebe, it was
Molly herself that was with Mr. Preston in Heath Lane that day when
Mrs. Goodenough saw them together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious goodness me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Phoebe, receiving it at once
as gospel. <div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By putting two and two together. Didn't you notice how red Molly
went, and then pale, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew for a fact that Mr.
Preston and Cynthia Kirkpatrick were not engaged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not engaged; but Mrs. Goodenough saw them loitering
together, all by their own two selves--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Goodenough only crossed Heath Lane at the Shire Oak, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) was
riding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) phaeton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning sententiously. <div class="bookquote">``We all
know what a coward she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) is in a carriage, so that most likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) had
only half her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) wits about her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) eyes are none of the best when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) is standing steady on the ground. Molly and Cynthia have got
their new plaid shawls just alike, and they trim their bonnets alike,
and Molly is grown as tall as Cynthia since Christmas. I was always
afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'d be short and stumpy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s now as tall and slender
as anyone need be. I'll answer for it, Mrs. Goodenough saw Molly, and
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for Cynthia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>When Miss Browning <div class="bookquote">``answered for it''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>Miss Phoebe gave up doubting.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sate some time in silence revolving her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) thoughts. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't be such a very bad match after all, sister.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) spoke
very meekly, awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister's sanction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) opinion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoebe, it would be a bad match for Mary Pearson's daughter. If
I had known what I know now we'd never have had him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to tea last
September.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Phoebe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Hornblower told me many things; some that I don't think
you ought to hear, Phoebe. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was engaged to a very pretty Miss
Gregson, at Henwick, where he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) comes from; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) father made
inquiries, and heard so much that was bad about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
daughter break off the match, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s dead since!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How shocking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe, duly impressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) plays at billiards, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bets at races, and some
people do say he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) keeps race-horses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But isn't it strange that the earl keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) on as his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) agent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! perhaps not. He (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>)'s very clever about land, and very sharp in all
law affairs; and my lord isn't bound to take notice--if indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
knows--of the manner in which Mr. Preston talks when he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) has taken too
much wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Taken too much wine! Oh, sister, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) a drunkard? and we have had
him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) to tea!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was a drunkard, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning,
pettishly. <div class="bookquote">``A man may take too much wine occasionally, without being
a drunkard. Don't let me hear you using such coarse words, Phoebe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Phoebe was silent for a time after this rebuke.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I do hope it wasn't Molly Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may hope as much as you like, but I'm pretty sure it was.
However, we'd better say nothing about it to Mrs. Goodenough; she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) has
got Cynthia into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head, and there let her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) rest. Time enough to set
reports afloat about Molly when we know there's some truth in them.
Mr. Preston might do for Cynthia, who's been brought up in France,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has such pretty manners; but it may have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) not
particular. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) must not, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) shall not, have Molly, if I go into
church and forbid the banns myself; but I'm afraid--I'm afraid
there's something between her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>). We must keep on the look-out,
Phoebe. I'll be her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) guardian angel, in spite of herself.''

<p/>GATHERING CLOUDS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>Mrs. Gibson came back full of rose-coloured accounts of London. Lady
Cumnor had been gracious and affectionate, <div class="bookquote">``so touched by my going
up to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) so soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) return to England,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>Lady Harriet

his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) dear usual hearty self;''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Cumnor</b></font>)</div>and as for the Kirkpatricks, no Lord
Chancellor's house was ever grander than theirs, and the silk gown of
the Q.C. had floated over housemaids and footmen. Cynthia, too, was
so much admired; and as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) dress, Mrs. Kirkpatrick had showered
down ball-dresses and wreaths, and pretty bonnets and mantles, like a
fairy godmother. Mr. Gibson's poor present of ten pounds shrank into
very small dimensions compared with all this munificence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they're so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>), I don't know when we shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>)
back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>was Mrs. Gibson's winding-up sentence. <div class="bookquote">``And now, Molly, what
have you and papa been doing? Very gay, you sounded in your letter.
I had not time to read it in London; so I put it in my pocket, and
read it in the coach coming home. But, my dear child, you do look
so old-fashioned with your gown made all tight, and your hair all
tumbling about in curls. Curls are quite gone out. We must do your
hair differently,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) continued, trying to smooth Molly's black
waves into straightness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sent Cynthia an African letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, timidly. <div class="bookquote">``Did you
hear anything of what was in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, poor child! It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) very uneasy, I think; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
did not feel inclined to go to Mr. Rawson's ball, which was on that
night, and for which Mrs. Kirkpatrick had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) the ball-dress.
But there was really nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) to fidget herself about. Roger
only said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had had another touch of fever, but was better when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
wrote. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) says every European has to be acclimatized by fever in that
part of Abyssinia where he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/>``Yes, to be sure. It is not an engagement; and if it were, it is not
acknowledged. Fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) going and saying, ``A young man that I know
has been ill for a few days in Africa, two months ago, therefore I
don't want to go to the ball to-night.<div class="bookquote">'' It would have seemed like
affectation of sentiment; and if there's one thing I hate it is
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) would hardly enjoy herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) did. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) dress was white gauze, trimmed with
lilacs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) really did look--a mother may be allowed a little
natural partiality--most lovely. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) danced every dance, although
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was quite a stranger. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) enjoyed herself, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
manner of talking about it next morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if the Squire knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Knows what? Oh, yes, to be sure--you mean about Roger. I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
doesn't, and there's no need to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), for I've no doubt it is all
right now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went out of the room to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) unpacking.

<p/>Molly let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) work fall, and sighed. <div class="bookquote">``It will be a year the day after
to-morrow since he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came here to propose our going to Hurst Wood, and
mamma was so vexed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) calling before lunch. I wonder if Cynthia
remembers it as well as I do. And now, perhaps-- Oh! Roger, Roger! I
wish--I pray that you were safe home again! How could we all bear it,
if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands, and tried to stop thinking.
Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) got up, as if stung by a venomous fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ought, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could not--could
not have gone and danced. What shall I do if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) does not? What shall
I do? I can bear anything but that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found the long suspense as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) health hard enough to
endure. They were not likely to hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for a month at least,
and before that time had elapsed Cynthia would be at home again.
Molly learnt to long for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) return before a fortnight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) absence
was over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had had no idea that perpetual tête-à-têtes with Mrs.
Gibson could, by any possibility, be so tiresome as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) found them.
Perhaps Molly's state of delicate health, consequent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) rapid
growth during the last few months, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) irritable; but really
often she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had to get up and leave the room to calm herself down after
listening to a long series of words, more frequently plaintive or
discontented in tone than cheerful, and which at the end conveyed
no distinct impression of either the speaker's thought or feeling.
Whenever anything had gone wrong, whenever Mr. Gibson had coolly
persevered in anything to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had objected; whenever the cook
had made a mistake about the dinner, or the housemaid broken any
little frangible article; whenever Molly's hair was not done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
liking, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dress did not become her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), or the smell of dinner
pervaded the house, or the wrong callers came, or the right callers
did not come--in fact, whenever anything went wrong, poor Mr.
Kirkpatrick was regretted and mourned over, nay, almost blamed, as
if, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) only given himself the trouble of living, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) could have
helped it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I look back to those happy days, it seems to me as if I had
never valued them as I ought. To be sure--youth, love,--what did we
care for poverty! I remember dear Mr. Kirkpatrick walking five miles
into Stratford to buy me a muffin because I had such a fancy for one
after Cynthia was born. I don't mean to complain of dear papa--but
I don't think--but, perhaps I ought not to say it to you. If Mr.
Kirkpatrick had but taken care of that cough of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) was so
obstinate! Men always are, I think. And it really was selfish of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>). Only I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) did not consider the forlorn state in which I
should be left. It came harder upon me than upon most people, because
I always was of such an affectionate sensitive nature. I remember a
little poem of Mr. Kirkpatrick's, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) compared my heart to a
harpstring, vibrating to the slightest breeze.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought harpstrings required a pretty strong finger to make them
sound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, you've no more poetry in you than your father. And as
for your hair! it's worse than ever. Can't you drench it in water to
take those untidy twists and twirls out of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It only makes it curl more and more when it gets dry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly,
sudden tears coming into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes as a recollection came before her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
like a picture seen long ago and forgotten for years--a young mother
washing and dressing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little girl; placing the half-naked darling
on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knee, and twining the wet rings of dark hair fondly round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
fingers, and then, in an ecstasy of fondness, kissing the little
curly head.

<p/>The receipt of Cynthia's letters made very agreeable events. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
did not write often, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) letters were tolerably long when they
did come, and very sprightly in tone. There was constant mention
made of many new names, which conveyed no idea to Molly, though Mrs.
Gibson would try and enlighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) by running commentaries like the
following:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Green! ah, that's Mr. Jones's pretty cousin, who lives in
Russell Square with the fat husband. They keep their carriage; but
I'm not sure if it is not Mr. Green who is Mrs. Jones's cousin. We
can ask Cynthia when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) comes home. Mr. Henderson! to be sure--a
young man with black whiskers, a pupil of Mr. Kirkpatrick's
formerly,--or was he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) a pupil of Mr. Murray's? I know they said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had
read law with somebody. Ah, yes! they are the people who called the
day after Mr. Rawson's ball, and who admired Cynthia so much, without
knowing I was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was very handsomely dressed indeed, in
black satin; and the son had a glass eye, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was a young man of
good property. Coleman! yes, that was the name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>No more news of Roger until some time after Cynthia had returned from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) London visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) came back looking fresher and prettier than
ever, beautifully dressed, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own good taste, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
cousin's generosity, full of amusing details of the gay life she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
been enjoying, yet not at all out of spirits at having left it behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) brought home all sorts of pretty and dainty devices for
Molly; a neck-ribbon made up in the newest fashion, a pattern for a
tippet, a delicate pair of light gloves, embroidered as Molly had
never seen gloves embroidered before, and many another little sign of
remembrance during her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) absence. Yet somehow or other, Molly felt that
Cynthia was changed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Molly was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had never had Cynthia's full confidence, for with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) apparent
frankness and _naïveté_ of manner, Cynthia was extremely reserved and
reticent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) knew this much of herself, and had often laughed about
it to Molly, and the latter had by this time found out the truth of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) friend's assertion. But Molly did not trouble herself much about
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) too knew that there were many thoughts and feelings that
flitted through her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should never think of telling
to any one, except perhaps--if they were ever very much thrown
together--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew that Cynthia withheld from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) more
than thoughts and feelings--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) withheld facts. But then, as
Molly reflected, these facts might involve details of struggle and
suffering--might relate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's neglect--and altogether be of
so painful a character, that it would be well if Cynthia could forget
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) childhood altogether, instead of fixing it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mind by the
relation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) grievances and troubles. So it was not now by any
want of confidence that Molly felt distanced as it were. It was
because Cynthia rather avoided than sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) companionship; because
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes shunned the straight, serious, loving look of Molly's;
because there were certain subjects on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) evidently disliked
speaking, not particularly interesting things as far as Molly could
perceive, but it almost seemed as if they lay on the road to points
to be avoided. Molly felt a sort of sighing pleasure in noticing
Cynthia's changed manner of talking about Roger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
tenderly now; <div class="bookquote">``poor Roger,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); and Molly thought
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must be referring to the illness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had mentioned
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) last letter. One morning in the first week after Cynthia's
return home, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was going out, Mr. Gibson ran up into the
drawing-room, hat on, booted and spurred, and hastily laid an open
pamphlet down before her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); pointing out a particular passage with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) finger, but not speaking a word before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rapidly quitted the
room. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes were sparkling, and had an amused as well as pleased
expression. All this Molly noticed, as well as Cynthia's flush of
colour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) read what was thus pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pushed
it a little on one side, not closing the book, however, and went on
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it? may I see it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand for
the pamphlet, which lay within her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) reach. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not take it
until Cynthia had said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; I don't suppose there are any great secrets in a
scientific journal, full of reports of meetings.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) gave the
book a little push towards Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) breath as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) read, <div class="bookquote">``are
you not proud?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For it was an account of an annual gathering of the
Geographical Society, and Lord Hollingford had read a letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had
received from Roger Hamley, dated from Arracuoba, a district in
Africa, hitherto unvisited by any intelligent European traveller; and
about which Mr. Hamley sent many curious particulars. The reading of
this letter had been received with the greatest interest, and several
subsequent speakers had paid the writer very high compliments.

<p/>But Molly might have known Cynthia better than to expect an answer
responsive to the feelings that prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) question. Let Cynthia
be ever so proud, ever so glad, or so grateful, or even indignant,
remorseful, grieved or sorry, the very fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was expected by
another to entertain any of these emotions, would have been enough to
prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) expressing them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I'm not as much struck by the wonder of the thing as you
are, Molly. Besides, it is not news to me; at least, not entirely.
I heard about the meeting before I left London; it was a good deal
talked about in my uncle's set; to be sure, I didn't hear all the
fine things they say of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) there--but then, you know, that's a mere
fashion of speaking, which means nothing; somebody is bound to pay
compliments when a lord takes the trouble to read one of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) letters
aloud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``You know you don't believe what you are
saying, Cynthia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia gave that pretty little jerk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) shoulders, which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
equivalent for a French shrug, but did not lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
sewing. Molly began to read the report over again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you might have been there; ladies were
there. It says `many ladies were present.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Oh, couldn't you have
managed to go? If your uncle's set cared about these things, wouldn't
some of them have taken you?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, if I had asked them. But I think they would have been
rather astonished at my sudden turn for science.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have told your uncle how matters really stood, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wouldn't
have talked about it if you had wished him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) not, I am sure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
could have helped you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once for all, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, now laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) work, and
speaking with quick authority, <div class="bookquote">``do learn to understand that it is,
and always has been my wish, not to have the relation which Roger and
I bear to each other, mentioned or talked about. When the right time
comes, I will make it known to my uncle, and to everybody whom it may
concern; but I am not going to make mischief, and get myself into
trouble--even for the sake of hearing compliments paid to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)--by
letting it out before the time. If I'm pushed to it, I'd sooner
break it off altogether at once, and have done with it. I can't be
worse off than I am now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) angry tone had changed into a kind of
desponding complaint before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had ended her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sentence. Molly looked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't understand you, Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said at length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I daresay you can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) with tears
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes, and very tenderly, as if in atonement for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) late
vehemence. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid--I hope you never will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>In a moment, Molly's arms were round her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
murmured, <div class="bookquote">``have I been plaguing you? Have I vexed you? Don't say
you're afraid of my knowing you. Of course you've your faults,
everybody has, but I think I love you the better for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I am so very bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, smiling a little
through the tears that Molly's words and caresses had forced to
overflow from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``But I have got into scrapes. I'm in a scrape
now. I do sometimes believe I shall always be in scrapes, and if they
ever come to light, I shall seem to be worse than I really am; and I
know your father will throw me off, and I--no, I won't be afraid that
you will, Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I won't. Are they--do you think--how would Roger take it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, very timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will never hear of it. I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
should, for in a little while I shall be quite clear again. It all
came about without my ever thinking I was doing wrong. I've a great
mind to tell you all about it, Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly did not like to urge it, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) longed to know, and to see
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not offer help; but while Cynthia was hesitating, and
perhaps, to say the truth, rather regretting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had even made
this slight advance towards bestowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) confidence, Mrs. Gibson
came in, full of some manner of altering a gown of hers, so as to
make it into the fashion of the day, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had seen it during her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
visit to London. Cynthia seemed to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) troubles,
and to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) whole soul into millinery.

<p/>Cynthia's correspondence went on pretty briskly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) London
cousins, according to the usual rate of correspondence in those
days. Indeed, Mrs. Gibson was occasionally inclined to complain of
the frequency of Helen Kirkpatrick's letters; for before the penny
post came in, the recipient had to pay the postage of letters; and
eleven-pence-halfpenny three times a week came, according to Mrs.
Gibson's mode of reckoning when annoyed, to a sum <div class="bookquote">``between three
and four shillings.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>But these complaints were only for the family;
they saw the wrong side of the tapestry. Hollingford in general,
Miss Brownings in particular, heard of <div class="bookquote">``dear Helen's enthusiastic
friendship for Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brownings/Brownings</b></font>)</div>and of <div class="bookquote">``the real pleasure it was to receive
such constant news--relays of news indeed--from London. It was almost
as good as living there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brownings/Brownings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great deal better I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning with some
severity. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) had got many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) notions of the metropolis
from the British Essayists, where town is so often represented as
the centre of dissipation, corrupting country wives and squires'
daughters, and unfitting them for all their duties by the constant
whirl of its not always innocent pleasures. London was a sort of
moral pitch, which few could touch and not be defiled. Miss Browning
had been on the watch for the signs of deterioration in Cynthia's
character ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) return home. But, except in a greater number
of pretty and becoming articles of dress, there was no great change
for the worse to be perceived. Cynthia had been <div class="bookquote">``in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>had
<div class="bookquote">``beheld the glare and glitter and dazzling display of London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>yet
had come back to Hollingford as ready as ever to place a chair for
Miss Browning, or to gather flowers for a nosegay for Miss Phoebe,
or to mend her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) own clothes. But all this was set down to the merits
of Cynthia, not to the credit of London-town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as I can judge of London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, sententiously
continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) tirade against the place, ``it's no better than a
pickpocket and a robber dressed up in the spoils of honest folk. I
should like to know where my Lord Hollingford was bred, and Mr. Roger
Hamley. Your good husband lent me that report of the meeting, Mrs.
Gibson, where so much was said about them both, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was as proud
of their praises as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been akin to them, and Phoebe read
it aloud to me, for the print was too small for my eyes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was a
good deal perplexed with all the new names of places, but I said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) had better skip them all, for we had never heard of them before
and probably should never hear of them again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) read out the
fine things they said of my lord, and Mr. Roger, and I put it to
you, where were they born and bred? Why, within eight miles of
Hollingford; it might have been Molly there or me; it's all a chance;
and then they go and talk about the pleasures of intellectual society
in London, and the distinguished people up there that it is such an
advantage to know, and all the time I know it's only shops and the
play that's the real attraction. But that's neither here nor there.
We all put our best foot foremost, and if we have a reason to give
that looks sensible we speak it out like men, and never say anything
about the silliness we are hugging to our hearts. But I ask you
again, where does this fine society come from, and these wise men,
and these distinguished travellers? Why, out of country parishes like
this! London picks 'em all up, and decks herself with them, and then
calls out loud to the folks she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s robbed, and says, ``Come and see
how fine I am.<div class="bookquote">'' Fine, indeed! I've no patience with London: Cynthia
is much better out of it; and I'm not sure, if I were you, Mrs.
Gibson, if I wouldn't stop up those London letters: they'll only be
unsettling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) may live in London some of these days, Miss
Browning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>simpered Mrs. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time enough then to be thinking of London. I wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) an honest
country husband with enough to live upon, and a little to lay by,
and a good character to boot. Mind that, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), firing
round upon the startled Molly; <div class="bookquote">``I wish Cynthia a husband with a good
character; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s got a mother to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); you've none, and
when your mother was alive she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a dear friend of mine: so I'm not
going to let you throw yourself away upon any one whose life isn't
clear and above-board, you may depend upon it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>This last speech fell like a bomb into the quiet little drawing-room,
it was delivered with such vehemence. Miss Browning, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) secret
heart, meant it as a warning against the intimacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) believed that
Molly had formed with Mr. Preston; but as it happened that Molly had
never dreamed of any such intimacy, the girl could not imagine why
such severity of speech should be addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Mrs. Gibson, who
always took up the points of every word or action where they touched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own self -LRB-and called it sensitiveness-RRB-, broke the silence that
followed Miss Browning's speech by saying, plaintively,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure, Miss Browning, you are very much mistaken if you think
that any mother could take more care of Molly than I do. I don't--I
can't think there is any need for any one to interfere to protect
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and I have not an idea why you have been talking in this way,
just as if we were all wrong, and you were all right. It hurts my
feelings, indeed it does; for Molly can tell you there is not a thing
or a favour that Cynthia has, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has not. And as for not taking
care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), why, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) were to go up to London to-morrow, I should
make a point of going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to see after her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); and I never did
it for Cynthia when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was at school in France; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) bedroom
is furnished just like Cynthia's, and I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) wear my red shawl
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) likes--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) might have it oftener if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would. I can't
think what you mean, Miss Browning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean to offend you, but I meant just to give Molly a hint.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) understands what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, boldly. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't a notion what you
meant, if you were alluding to anything more than you said straight
out,--that you do not wish me to marry any one who hasn't a good
character, and that, as you were a friend of mamma's, you would
prevent my marrying a man with a bad character, by every means in
your power. I'm not thinking of marrying; I don't want to marry
anybody at all; but if I did, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) were not a good man, I should
thank you for coming and warning me of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not stand on warning you, Molly. I shall forbid the banns in
church, if need be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, half convinced of the clear
transparent truth of what Molly had said--blushing all over, it is
true, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) steady eyes fixed on Miss Browning's face while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, I won't say any more. Perhaps I was mistaken. We won't
say any more about it. But remember what I have said, Molly; there's
no harm in that, at any rate. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, Mrs.
Gibson. As stepmothers go, I think you try and do your duty. Good
morning. Good-by to you both, and God bless you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>If Miss Browning thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) final blessing would secure peace
in the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was leaving, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was very much mistaken; Mrs. Gibson
burst out with,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try and do my duty, indeed! I should be much obliged to you, Molly,
if you would take care not to behave in such a manner as to bring
down upon me such impertinence as I have just been receiving from
Miss Browning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't know what made her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) talk as she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) did, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't know, and I don't care either. But I know
that I never was spoken to as if I was trying to do my duty
before,--`trying' indeed! everybody always knew that I did it,
without talking about it before my face in that rude manner. I've
that deep feeling about duty that I think it ought only to be talked
about in church, and in such sacred places as that; not to have a
common caller startling one with it, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was an early
friend of your mother's. And as if I didn't look after you quite as
much as I look after Cynthia! Why, it was only yesterday I went up
into Cynthia's room and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) reading a letter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) put away
in a hurry as soon as I came in, and I didn't even ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) who it was
from, and I'm sure I should have made you tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Very likely. Mrs. Gibson shrank from any conflicts with Cynthia,
pretty sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would be worsted in the end; while Molly
generally submitted sooner than have any struggle for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own will.

<p/>Just then Cynthia came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) quickly, seeing that something was
wrong.

<p/>``Why, Molly has been doing something which has set that impertinent
Miss Browning off into lecturing me on trying to do my duty! If your
poor father had but lived, Cynthia, I should never have been spoken
to as I have been. ``A stepmother trying to do her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) duty,<div class="bookquote">'' indeed! That
was Miss Browning's expression.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A stepmother</b></font>)</div><p/>Any allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) father took from Cynthia all desire of irony. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
came forward, and again asked Molly what was the matter.

<p/>Molly, herself ruffled, made answer,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Browning seemed to think I was likely to marry some one whose
character was objectionable--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) once before spoke to me,--I suspect she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has got some notion
about Mr. Preston in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia sate down quite suddenly. Molly went on: <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke
as if mamma did not look enough after me,--I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was rather
provoking--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not rather, but very--very impertinent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, a little
soothed by Molly's recognition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) grievance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What could have put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, very quietly,
taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sewing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother, replying to the question after her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
own fashion. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't always approve of Mr. Preston; but
even if it was him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was thinking about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s far more agreeable
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is; and I had much rather have him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) coming to call than an
old maid like her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) any day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that it was Mr. Preston she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was thinking about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said
Molly. <div class="bookquote">``It was only a guess. When you were both in London she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) spoke
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>),--I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had heard something about you and him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>),
Cynthia.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Unseen by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother Cynthia looked up at Molly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes
full of prohibition, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cheeks full of angry colour. Molly stopped
short suddenly. After that look she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was surprised at the quietness
with which Cynthia said, almost immediately,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, after all, it is only your fancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was alluding to Mr.
Preston, so perhaps we had better not say any more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); and as
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) advice to mamma to look after you better, Miss Molly, I'll
stand bail for your good behaviour; for both mamma and I know you're
the last person to do any foolish things in that way. And now don't
let us talk any more about it. I was coming to tell you that Hannah
Brand's little boy has been badly burnt, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister is downstairs
asking for old linen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson was always kind to poor people, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) immediately got
up and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stores to search for the article wanted.

<p/>Cynthia turned quietly round to Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, pray don't ever allude to anything between me and Mr.
Preston,--not to mamma, nor to any one. Never do! I've a reason for
it,--don't say anything more about it, ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson came back at this moment, and Molly had to stop short
again on the brink of Cynthia's confidence; uncertain indeed this
time, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have been told anything more, and only sure
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had annoyed Cynthia a good deal.

<p/>But the time was approaching when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would know all.




<p/>CHAPTER XLII.

<p/>THE STORM BURSTS.


<p/>The autumn drifted away through all its seasons. The golden
corn-harvest, the walks through the stubble-fields, and rambles into
hazel-copses in search of nuts; the stripping of the apple-orchards
of their ruddy fruit, amid the joyous cries and shouts of watching
children; and the gorgeous tulip-like colouring of the later time had
now come on with the shortening days. There was comparative silence
in the land, excepting for the distant shots, and the whirr of the
partridges as they rose up from the field.

<p/>Ever since Miss Browning's unlucky conversation, things had been
ajar in the Gibsons' house. Cynthia seemed to keep every one out at
-LRB-mental-RRB- arms'-length; and particularly avoided any private talks
with Molly. Mrs. Gibson, still cherishing a grudge against Miss
Browning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) implied accusation of not looking enough after
Molly, chose to exercise a most wearying supervision over the poor
girl. It was, <div class="bookquote">``Where have you been, child?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who did you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who
was that letter from?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why were you so long out when you had only
to go to so-and-so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>just as if Molly had really been detected in
carrying on some underhand intercourse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) answered every question
asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with the simple truthfulness of perfect innocence;
but the inquiries -LRB-although she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) read their motive, and knew that
they arose from no especial suspicion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) conduct, but only that
Mrs. Gibson might be able to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) looked well after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
stepdaughter-RRB- chafed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) inexpressibly. Very often she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not go out
at all, sooner than have to give a plan of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) intended proceedings,
when perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had no plan at all,--only thought of wandering out
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own sweet will, and of taking pleasure in the bright solemn
fading of the year. It was a very heavy time for Molly,--zest and
life had fled, and left so many of the old delights mere shells of
seeming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought it was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) youth had fled; at nineteen!
Cynthia was no longer the same, somehow: and perhaps Cynthia's change
would injure her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) in the distant Roger's opinion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stepmother
seemed almost kind in comparison with Cynthia's withdrawal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
heart; Mrs. Gibson worried her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), to be sure, with all these forms of
watching over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); but in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) other ways, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), at any rate, was
the same. Yet Cynthia herself seemed anxious and care-worn, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would not speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) anxieties to Molly. And then the poor girl
in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) goodness would blame herself for feeling Cynthia's change of
manner; for as Molly said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``If it is hard work for me to
help always fretting after Roger, and wondering where he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is, and how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is, what must it be for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>One day Mr. Gibson came in, bright and swift.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``where's Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone out to do some errands--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's a pity--but never mind. Put on your bonnet and cloak as
fast as you can. I've had to borrow old Simpson's dog-cart,--there
would have been room both for you and Cynthia; but as it is, you must
walk back alone. I'll drive you as far on the Barford Road as I can,
and then you must jump down. I can't take you on to Broadhurst's, I
may be kept there for hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson was out of the room; out of the house it might be, for
all Molly cared, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's leave and command. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
bonnet and cloak were on in two minutes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father's side, the back seat shut up, and the light weight going
swiftly and merrily bumping over the stone-paved lanes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, this is charming!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, after a toss-up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) seat from
a tremendous bump.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For youth, but not for crabbed age,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``My bones are
getting rheumatic, and would rather go smoothly over macadamized
streets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's treason to this lovely view and this fine pure air, papa.
Only I don't believe you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. As you are so complimentary, I think I shall put you down
at the foot of this hill; we've passed the second mile-stone from
Hollingford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, let me just go up to the top! I know we can see the blue range
of the Malverns from it, and Dorrimer Hall among the woods; the horse
will want a minute's rest, and then I will get down without a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went up to the top of the hill; and there they sate still a
minute or two, enjoying the view, without much speaking. The woods
were golden; the old house of purple-red brick, with its twisted
chimneys, rose up from among them facing on to green lawns, and a
placid lake; beyond again were the Malvern Hills.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now jump down, lassie, and make the best of your way home before it
gets dark. You'll find the cut over Croston Heath shorter than the
road we've come by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Croston Heath</b></font>)</div><p/>To get to Croston Heath, Molly had to go down a narrow lane
overshadowed by trees, with picturesque old cottages dotted here and
there on the steep sandy banks; and then there came a small wood,
and then there was a brook to be crossed on a plank-bridge, and up
the steeper fields on the opposite side were cut steps in the turfy
path; these ended, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was on Croston Heath, a wide-stretching
common skirted by labourers' dwellings, past which a near road to
Hollingford lay.

<p/>The loneliest part of the road was the first--the lane, the wood,
the little bridge, and the clambering through the upland fields. But
Molly cared little for loneliness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went along the lane under the
over-arching elm-branches, from which, here and there, a yellow leaf
came floating down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) very dress; past the last cottage where
a little child had tumbled down the sloping bank, and was publishing
the accident with frightened cries. Molly stooped to pick it up, and
taking it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms in a manner which caused intense surprise to
take the place of alarm in its little breast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) carried it up the
rough flag steps towards the cottage which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) supposed to be its
home. The mother came running in from the garden behind the house,
still holding the late damsons she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been gathering in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) apron;
but, on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), the little creature held out its arms to go to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) damsons all about as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took it, and began
to soothe it as it cried afresh, interspersing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lulling with
thanks to Molly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) name; and on Molly asking the
woman how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came to know it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) replied that before her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) marriage
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been a servant of Mrs. Goodenough, and so was <div class="bookquote">``bound to
know Dr. Gibson's daughter by sight.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>After the exchange of two or
three more words, Molly ran down into the lane, and pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) way,
stopping here and there to gather a nosegay of such leaves as struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for their brilliant colouring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) entered the wood. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
turned a corner in the lonely path, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard a passionate voice of
distress; and in an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) recognized Cynthia's tones. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stood
still and looked around. There were some thick holly-bushes shining
out dark green in the midst of the amber and scarlet foliage. If
any one was there, it must be behind these thick bushes. So Molly
left the path, and went straight, plunging through the brown tangled
growth of ferns and underwood, and turned the holly bushes. There
stood Mr. Preston and Cynthia; he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hands tight, each
looking as if just silenced in some vehement talk by the rustle of
Molly's footsteps.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: THERE STOOD MR. PRESTON AND CYNTHIA.-RSB-


<p/>For an instant no one spoke. Then Cynthia said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Molly, Molly, come and judge between us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Preston let go Cynthia's hands slowly, with a look that was more
of a sneer than a smile; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), too, had been strongly agitated,
whatever was the subject in dispute. Molly came forward and took
Cynthia's arm, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes steadily fixed on Mr. Preston's face. It was
fine to see the fearlessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) perfect innocence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) could not
bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) look, and said to Cynthia,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The subject of our conversation does not well admit of a third
person's presence. As Miss Gibson seems to wish for your company now,
I must beg you to fix some other time and place where we can finish
our discussion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go if Cynthia wishes me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; stay--I want you to stay--I want you to hear it all--I wish
I had told you sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that you regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has not been made aware of our
engagement--that you promised long ago to be my wife. Pray remember
that it was you who made me promise secrecy, not I you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), Cynthia. Don't, don't cry if you can help it;
I don't believe him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), suddenly changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) tone to fervid tenderness,
<div class="bookquote">``pray, pray do not go on so; you can't think how it distresses me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) stepped forward to try and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand and soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
shrank away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), and sobbed the more irrepressibly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt
Molly's presence so much to be a protection that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dared to
let herself go, and to weaken herself by giving way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see you make her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) worse?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
did not stir; he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was looking at Cynthia so intently that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) did not
seem even to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, vehemently, <div class="bookquote">``if it really
distresses you to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cry. Don't you see, it's you who are the
cause of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go if Cynthia tells me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) at length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Molly, I don't know what to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, taking down her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
hands from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tear-stained face, and appealing to Molly, and sobbing
worse than ever; in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) became hysterical, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tried
to speak coherently, no intelligible words would come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run to that cottage in the trees, and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a cup of water,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) hesitated a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not done speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); you will not leave before I come
back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Don't you see she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) can't move in this state?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) went quickly, if reluctantly.

<p/>Cynthia was some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could check her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sobs enough to
speak. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``Molly, I do hate him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mean by saying you were engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)? Don't cry,
dear, but tell me; if I can help you I will, but I can't imagine what
it all really is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too long a story to tell now, and I'm not strong enough. Look!
he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s coming back. As soon as I can, let us get home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) brought the water, and Cynthia drank, and was restored to
calmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``we had better go home as fast as you can manage
it; it's getting dark quickly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hoped to carry Cynthia off so easily she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was mistaken. Mr.
Preston was resolute on this point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think since Miss Gibson has made herself acquainted with this
much, we had better let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) know the whole truth--that you are
engaged to marry me as soon as you are twenty; otherwise your being
here with me, and by appointment too, may appear strange--even
equivocal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I know that Cynthia is engaged to--another man, you can hardly
expect me to believe what you say, Mr. Preston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, trembling all over, but trying to be
calm, <div class="bookquote">``I am not engaged--neither to the person you mean, nor to Mr.
Preston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Preston forced a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I think I have some letters that would
convince Miss Gibson of the truth of what I have said; and which will
convince Mr. Osborne Hamley, if necessary--I conclude it is to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is alluding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite puzzled by you both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``The only thing I
do know is, that we ought not to be standing here at this time of
evening, and that Cynthia and I shall go home directly. If you want
to talk to Miss Kirkpatrick, Mr. Preston, why don't you come to my
father's house, and ask to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) openly, and like a gentleman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly willing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I shall only be too glad to
explain to Mr. Gibson on what terms I stand in relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>). If I
have not done it sooner, it is because I have yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) wishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray don't. Molly--you don't know all--you don't know anything
about it; you mean well and kindly, I know, but you are only making
mischief. I am quite well enough to walk, do let us go; I will tell
you all about it when we are at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took Molly's arm and tried
to hasten her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) away; but Mr. Preston followed, talking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) walked by
their side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what you will say at home; but can you deny that you
are my promised wife? Can you deny that it has only been at your
earnest request that I have kept the engagement secret so long?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
was unwise--Cynthia stopped, and turned at bay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you will have it out,--since I must speak here, I own that
what you say is literally true; that when I was a neglected girl of
sixteen, you--whom I believed to be a friend, lent me money at my
need, and made me give you a promise of marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Made you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), laying an emphasis on the first word.

<p/>Cynthia turned scarlet. <div class="bookquote">''`Made' is not the right word, I confess.
I liked you then--you were almost my only friend--and, if it had
been a question of immediate marriage, I daresay I should never have
objected. But I know you better now; and you have persecuted me so of
late, that I tell you once for all -LRB-as I have told you before, till
I am sick of the very words-RRB-, that nothing shall ever make me marry
you. Nothing! I see there's no chance of escaping exposure and, I
daresay, losing my character, and I know losing all the few friends
I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, touched by the wailing tone of despair that
Cynthia was falling into.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Preston. <div class="bookquote">``You may believe all the bad things
you like about me, Cynthia, but I don't think you can doubt my real,
passionate, disinterested love for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, breaking out with fresh energy. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
when I think of the self-denying affection I have seen--I have
known--affection that thought of others before itself--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Preston broke in at the pause she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) made. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was afraid of
revealing too much to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not call it love which has been willing to wait for years--to
be silent while silence was desired--to suffer jealousy and to bear
neglect, relying on the solemn promise of a girl of sixteen--for
solemn say flimsy, when that girl grows older. Cynthia, I have loved
you, and I do love you, and I won't give you up. If you will but keep
your word, and marry me, I'll swear I'll make you love me in return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I wish--I wish I'd never borrowed that unlucky money, it was the
beginning of it all. Oh, Molly, I have saved and scrimped to repay
it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) won't take it now; I thought if I could but repay it, it
would set me free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to imply you sold yourself for twenty pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) said.
They were nearly on the common now, close to the protection of the
cottages, in very hearing of their inmates; if neither of the other
two thought of this, Molly did, and resolved in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind to call in
at one of them, and ask for the labourer's protection home; at any
rate his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) presence must put a stop to this miserable altercation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not sell myself; I liked you then. But oh, how I do hate you
now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>cried Cynthia, unable to contain her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) words.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) bowed and turned back, vanishing rapidly down the field staircase.
At any rate that was a relief. Yet the two girls hastened on, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) was still pursuing them. Once, when Molly said something to
Cynthia, the latter replied--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, if you pity me--if you love me--don't say anything more just
now. We shall have to look as if nothing had happened when we get
home. Come to my room when we go upstairs to bed, and I'll tell you
all. I know you'll blame me terribly, but I will tell you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>So Molly did not say another word till they reached home; and then,
comparatively at ease, inasmuch as no one perceived how late was
their return to the house, each of the girls went up into their
separate rooms, to rest and calm themselves before dressing for the
necessary family gathering at dinner. Molly felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were so
miserably shaken that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not have gone down at all, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
interests only had been at stake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sate by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dressing-table,
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) candles unlighted, and the room in
soft darkness, trying to still her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) beating heart, and to recall all
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had heard, and what would be its bearing on the lives of those
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) loved. Roger. Oh, Roger!--far away in mysterious darkness of
distance--loving as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did -LRB-ah, that was love! that was the love to
which Cynthia had referred, as worthy of the name!-RRB- and the object of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love claimed by another--false to one she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) must be! How could it
be? What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) think and feel if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came to know it? It was
of no use trying to imagine his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pain--that could do no good. What lay
before Molly was, to try and extricate Cynthia, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could help her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
by thought, or advice, or action; not to weaken herself by letting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) fancy run into pictures of possible, probable suffering.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went into the drawing-room before dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) found Cynthia
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother by themselves. There were candles in the room, but
they were not lighted, for the wood-fire blazed merrily if fitfully,
and they were awaiting Mr. Gibson's return, which might be expected
at any minute. Cynthia sate in the shade, so it was only by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
sensitive ear that Molly could judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) state of composure. Mrs.
Gibson was telling some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) day's adventures--whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had found
at home in the calls she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been making; who had been out; and
the small pieces of news she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had heard. To Molly's quick sympathy
Cynthia's voice sounded languid and weary, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) made all the
proper replies, and expressed the proper interest at the right
places, and Molly came to the rescue, chiming in, with an effort,
it is true; but Mrs. Gibson was not one to notice slight shades
or differences in manner. When Mr. Gibson returned, the relative
positions of the parties were altered. It was Cynthia now who raised
herself into liveliness, partly from a consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would
have noticed any depression, and partly because Cynthia was one
of those natural coquettes, who, from their cradle to their grave,
instinctively bring out all their prettiest airs and graces in order
to stand well with any man, young or old, who may happen to be
present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remarks and stories with all the sweet
intentness of happier days, till Molly, silent and wondering, could
hardly believe that the Cynthia before her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was the same girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
who was sobbing and crying as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) heart would break, but two hours
before. It is true she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) looked pale and heavy-eyed, but that was the
only sign she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) gave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) past trouble, which yet must be a present
care, thought Molly. After dinner, Mr. Gibson went out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) town
patients; Mrs. Gibson subsided into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) arm-chair, holding a sheet of
_The Times_ before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), behind which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took a quiet and lady-like
doze. Cynthia had a book in one hand, with the other she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) shaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
eyes from the light. Molly alone could neither read, nor sleep, nor
work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sate in the seat in the bow-window; the blind was not drawn
down, for there was no danger of their being overlooked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gazed
into the soft outer darkness, and found herself striving to discern
the outlines of objects--the cottage at the end of the garden--the
great beech-tree with the seat round it--the wire arches, up which
the summer roses had clambered; each came out faint and dim against
the dusky velvet of the atmosphere. Presently tea came, and there was
the usual nightly bustle. The table was cleared, Mrs. Gibson roused
herself, and made the same remark about dear papa that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had done
at the same hour for weeks past. Cynthia too did not look different
from usual. And yet what a hidden mystery did her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) calmness hide!
thought Molly. At length came bed-time, and the customary little
speeches. Both Molly and Cynthia went to their own rooms without
exchanging a word. When Molly was in hers she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had forgotten whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was to go to Cynthia, or Cynthia to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
gown and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) dressing-gown, and stood and waited, and even sat
down for a minute or two: but Cynthia did not come, so Molly went and
knocked at the opposite door, which, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found shut.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) entered the room Cynthia sate by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) dressing-table, just as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had come up from the drawing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had been leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) arms, and seemed almost to have forgotten the tryst she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
made with Molly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked up as if startled, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face did
seem full of worry and distress; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) solitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made no more
exertion, but gave way to thoughts of care.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIII.

<p/>CYNTHIA``S CONFESSION.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said I might come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``and that you would tell me
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know all, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, heavily. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you don't
know what excuses I have, but at any rate you know what a scrape I am
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, timidly and
doubtfully. <div class="bookquote">``And I can't help fancying if you told papa--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could go on, Cynthia had stood up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That I won't. Unless I'm to leave here at once. And
you know I have not another place to go to--without warning, I mean.
I daresay my uncle would take me in; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s a relation, and would be
bound to stand by me in whatever disgrace I might be; or perhaps I
might get a governess's situation--a pretty governess I should be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, please, Cynthia, don't go off into such wild talking. I don't
believe you've done so very wrong. You say you have not, and I
believe you. That horrid man has managed to get you involved in some
way; but I am sure papa could set it to rights, if you would only
make a friend of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) all--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, <div class="bookquote">``I can't, and there's an end of it. You
may if you like, only let me leave the house first; give me that much
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I would never tell anything you wished me not to tell,
Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, deeply hurt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you not, darling?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Will you
promise me that? quite a sacred promise?--for it would be such a
comfort to me to tell you all, now you know so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I'll promise not to tell. You should not have doubted me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said
Molly, still a little sorrowfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I trust to you. I know I may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do think of telling papa, and getting him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to help you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>persevered Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, resolutely, but more quietly than before.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you think I forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said at the time of that wretched
Mr. Coxe; how severe he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was, and how long I was in disgrace, if
indeed I'm out of it now? I am one of those people, as mamma says
sometimes--I cannot live with persons who don't think well of me.
It may be a weakness, or a sin,--I'm sure I don't know, and I don't
care; but I really cannot be happy in the same house with any one who
knows my faults, and thinks that they are greater than my merits. Now
you know your father would do that. I have often told you that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
-LRB-and you too, Molly,-RRB- had a higher standard than I had ever known.
Oh, I couldn't bear it; if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were to know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be so angry with
me--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would never get over it, and I have so liked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! I do so like
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, never mind, dear; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shall not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, for Cynthia
was again becoming hysterical,--<div class="bookquote">``at least, we'll say no more about it
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll never say any more--never--promise me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia,
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never till you give me leave. Now do let me see if I cannot help
you. Lie down on the bed, and I'll sit by you, and let us talk it
over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>But Cynthia sat down again in the chair by the dressing-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did it all begin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, after a long pause of silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Long ago--four or five years. I was such a child to be left all to
myself. It was the holidays, and mamma was away visiting, and the
Donaldsons asked me to go with them to the Worcester Festival. You
can't fancy how pleasant it all sounded, especially to me. I had been
shut up in that great dreary house at Ashcombe, where mamma had her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
school; it belonged to Lord Cumnor, and Mr. Preston as his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) agent had
to see it all painted and papered; but, besides that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was very
intimate with us; I believe mamma thought--no, I'm not sure about
that, and I have enough blame to lay at her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) door, to prevent my
telling you anything that may be only fancy--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) paused and sate still for a minute or two, recalling the
past. Molly was struck by the aged and careworn expression which had
taken temporary hold of the brilliant and beautiful face; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could
see from that how much Cynthia must have suffered from this hidden
trouble of hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! at any rate we were intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) came a great
deal about the house, and knew as much as any one of mamma's affairs,
and all the ins and outs of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) life. I'm telling you this in order
that you may understand how natural it was for me to answer his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
questions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) came one day and found me, not crying, for you know
I'm not much given to that, in spite of to-day's exposure of myself;
but fretting and fuming because, though mamma had written word I
might go with the Donaldsons, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had never said how I was to get any
money for the journey, much less for anything of dress, and I had
outgrown all my last year's frocks, and as for gloves and boots--in
short, I really had hardly clothes decent enough for church--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you write to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, half
afraid of appearing to cast blame by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) very natural question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) letter to show you; you must have seen some of
mamma's letters, though; don't you know how she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) always seems to
leave out just the important point of every fact? In this case she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
descanted largely on the enjoyment she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was having, and the kindness
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was receiving, and her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wish that I could have been with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) gladness that I too was going to have some pleasure; but the only
thing that would have been of real use to me she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) left out, and that
was where she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was going to next. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mentioned that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was leaving
the house she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was stopping at the day after she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wrote, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) should be at home by a certain date; but I got the letter on a
Saturday, and the festival began the next Tuesday--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Still, if you had written, your letter
might have been forwarded. I don't mean to be hard, only I do so
dislike the thought of your ever having made a friend of that man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, sighing. <div class="bookquote">``How easy it is to judge rightly
after one sees what evil comes from judging wrongly! I was only a
young girl, hardly more than a child, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a friend to us
then--excepting mamma, the only friend I knew; the Donaldsons were
only kind and good-natured acquaintances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, humbly, <div class="bookquote">``I have been so happy with papa.
I hardly can understand how different it must have been with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Different! I should think so. The worry about money made me sick of
my life. We might not say we were poor, it would have injured the
school; but I would have stinted and starved if mamma and I had got
on as happily together as we might have done--as you and Mr. Gibson
do. It was not the poverty; it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never seemed to care to
have me with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). As soon as the holidays came round she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was off to
some great house or another; and I daresay I was at a very awkward
age to have me lounging about in the drawing-room when callers came.
Girls at the age I was then are so terribly keen at scenting out
motives, and putting in their disagreeable questions as to the little
twistings and twirlings and vanishings of conversation; they've no
distinct notion of what are the truths and falsehoods of polite
life. At any rate, I was very much in mamma's way, and I felt it. Mr.
Preston seemed to feel it too for me; and I was very grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
for kind words and sympathetic looks--crumbs of kindness which would
have dropped under your table unnoticed. So this day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) came
to see how the workmen were getting on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) found me in the deserted
schoolroom, looking at my faded summer bonnet and some old ribbons
I had been sponging, and half-worn-out gloves--a sort of rag-fair
spread out on the deal table. I was in a regular passion with only
looking at that shabbiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was so glad to hear I was
going to this festival with the Donaldsons; old Betty, our servant,
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) the news, I believe. But I was so perplexed about money,
and my vanity was so put out about my shabby dress, that I was in a
pet, and said I shouldn't go. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sate down on the table, and little
by little he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) made me tell him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) all my troubles. I do sometimes think
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was very nice in those days. Somehow I never felt as if it was
wrong or foolish or anything to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) offer of money at the
time. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had twenty pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said, and really didn't
know what to do with it,--shouldn't want it for months; I could repay
it, or rather mamma could, when it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must have known
I should want money, and most likely thought I should apply to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).
Twenty pounds wouldn't be too much, I must take it all, and so on.
I knew--at least I thought I knew--that I should never spend twenty
pounds; but I thought I could give him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) back what I didn't want, and
so--well, that was the beginning! It doesn't sound so very wrong,
does it, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, hesitatingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not wish to make herself into
a hard judge, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did so dislike Mr. Preston. Cynthia went
on,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what with boots and gloves, and a bonnet and a mantle, and a
white muslin gown, which was made for me before I left on Tuesday,
and a silk gown that followed to the Donaldsons', and my journeys,
and all, there was very little left of the twenty pounds, especially
when I found I must get a ball-dress in Worcester, for we were all
to go to the Ball. Mrs. Donaldson gave me my ticket, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Donaldson</b></font>) rather
looked grave at my idea of going to the Ball in my white muslin,
which I had already worn two evenings at their house. Oh dear! how
pleasant it must be to be rich! You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>continued Cynthia, smiling
a very little, <div class="bookquote">``I can't help being aware that I'm pretty, and that
people admire me very much. I found it out first at the Donaldsons'.
I began to think I did look pretty in my fine new clothes, and I saw
that other people thought so too. I was certainly the belle of the
house, and it was very pleasant to feel my power. The last day or
two of that gay week Mr. Preston joined our party. The last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
had seen me was when I was dressed in shabby clothes too small for
me, half-crying in my solitude, neglected and penniless. At the
Donaldsons' I was a little queen; and as I said, fine feathers make
fine birds, and all the people were making much of me; and at that
Ball, which was the first night he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) came, I had more partners than I
knew what to do with. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) really did fall in love with me
then. I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had done so before. And then I began to feel
how awkward it was to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) debt. I couldn't give myself airs to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) as I did to others. Oh! it was so awkward and uncomfortable! But
I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), and felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) as a friend all the time. The last day I
was walking in the garden along with the others, and I thought I
would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) how much I had enjoyed myself, and how happy I had
been, all thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) twenty pounds -LRB-I was beginning to feel like
Cinderella when the clock was striking twelve-RRB-, and to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) it
should be repaid to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as soon as possible, though I turned sick
at the thought of telling mamma, and knew enough of our affairs to
understand how very difficult it would be to muster up the money. The
end of our talk came very soon; for, almost to my terror, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) began to
talk violent love to me, and to beg me to promise to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). I was
so frightened, that I ran away to the others. But that night I got
a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), apologizing for startling me, renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) offer,
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) entreaties for a promise of marriage, to be fulfilled at any date
I would please to name--in fact, a most urgent love-letter, and in
it a reference to my unlucky debt, which was to be a debt no longer,
only an advance of the money to be hereafter mine if only-- You can
fancy it all, Molly, better than I can remember it to tell it you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, breathless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not answer it at all until another letter came, entreating for
a reply. By that time mamma had come home, and the old daily pressure
and plaint of poverty had come on. Mary Donaldson wrote to me often,
singing the praises of Mr. Preston as enthusiastically as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
been bribed to do it. I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) a very popular man in their set,
and I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) well enough, and felt grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>). So I wrote and
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) my promise to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) when I was twenty, but it was to be
a secret till then. And I tried to forget I had ever borrowed money
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), but somehow as soon as I felt pledged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) I began to hate
him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>). I couldn't endure his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) eagerness of greeting if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) found me
alone; and mamma began to suspect, I think. I cannot tell you all the
ins and outs; in fact, I didn't understand them at the time, and I
don't remember clearly how it all happened now. But I know that Lady
Cuxhaven sent mamma some money to be applied to my education, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) called it; and mamma seemed very much put out and in very low
spirits, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) and I didn't get on at all together. So, of course,
I never ventured to name the hateful twenty pounds to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>), but went
on trying to think that if I was to marry Mr. Preston, it need never
be paid--very mean and wicked, I daresay; but oh, Molly, I've been
punished for it, for how I abhor that man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why? When did you begin to dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? You seem to have taken
it very passively all this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. It was growing upon me before I went to that school
at Boulogne. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made me feel as if I was in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power; and by too
often reminding me of my engagement to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made me critical of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words and ways. There was an insolence in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner to mamma,
too. Ah! you're thinking that I'm not too respectful a daughter--and
perhaps not; but I couldn't bear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) covert sneers at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) faults, and
I hated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way of showing what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) `love' for me. Then,
after I had been a _semestre_ at Mdme. Lefevre's, a new English girl
came--a cousin of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), who knew but little of me. Now, Molly, you
must forget as soon as I've told you what I'm going to say; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
used to talk so much and perpetually about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cousin Robert--he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was
the great man of the family, evidently--and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was so handsome,
and every lady of the land in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>),--a lady of title into
the bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Harriet! I daresay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, indignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, wearily. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't care at the time,
and I don't care now; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) went on to say there was a very pretty
widow too, who made desperate love to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had often laughed with
them at all her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) little advances, which she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) didn't see
through. And, oh! and this was the man I had promised to marry, and
gone into debt to, and written love-letters to! So now you understand
it all, Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't yet. What did you do on hearing how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spoken about
your mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was but one thing to do. I wrote and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I hated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
would never, never marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and would pay him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money and
the interest on it as soon as ever I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mdme. Lefevre brought me back my letter,--unopened, I will say;
and told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't allow letters to gentlemen to be sent by
the pupils of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) establishment unless she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had previously seen their
contents. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefevre</b></font>) was a family friend, the agent who managed
mamma's affairs--I really could not stick at the truth; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wouldn't let it go; and I had to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) burn it, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) my
promise I wouldn't write again before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would consent not to tell
mamma. So I had to calm down and wait till I came home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefevre</b></font>) then; at least, not for some time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I could write; and I began to try and save up my money to
pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Lefevre</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefevre</b></font>) say to your letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefevre</b></font>) pretended not to believe I could be in earnest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lefevre</b></font>)

for and covered over with passionate protestations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And afterwards?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lefevre</b></font>) condescended to threats; and, what is worse, then I turned
coward. I couldn't bear to have it all known and talked about, and
my silly letters shown--oh, such letters! I cannot bear to think of
them, beginning, ``My dearest Robert,<div class="bookquote">'' to that man--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, oh, Cynthia, how could you go and engage yourself to Roger?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Robert</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, sharply turning round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I was
free--I am free; it seemed a way of assuring myself that I was quite
free; and I did like Roger--it was such a comfort to be brought into
contact with people who could be relied upon; and I was not a stock
or a stone that I could fail to be touched with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tender, unselfish
love, so different to Mr. Preston's. I know you don't think me good
enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); and, of course, if all this comes out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) won't think
me good enough either''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-falling into a plaintive tone very touching
to hear-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``and sometimes I think I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) up, and go off to some
fresh life amongst strangers; and once or twice I've thought I would
marry Mr. Preston out of pure revenge, and have him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) for ever in my
power--only I think I should have the worst of it; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) is cruel
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) very soul--tigerish, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) beautiful striped skin and
relentless heart. I have so begged and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) to let me go
without exposure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind the exposure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``It will recoil far more on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) than harm you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia went a little paler. <div class="bookquote">``But I said things in those letters
about mamma. I was quick-eyed enough to all her (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>) faults, and hardly
understood the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>) temptations; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) will show
those letters to your father, unless I consent to acknowledge our

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) shall not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, rising up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) indignation, and

many an appointment with me, just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) would take back the

if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) would give me back my letters. Poor, poor Roger! How little he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
thinks of all this! When I want to write words of love to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) I pull
myself up, for I have written words as affectionate to that other
man. And if Mr. Preston ever guessed that Roger and I were engaged,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would manage to be revenged on both him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and me, by giving us as
much pain as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could with those unlucky letters--written when I was

sure he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) can make me love him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia began to cry, out of weariness
of body and despair of mind. Molly's arms were round her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in a minute,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pressed the beautiful head to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bosom, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
cheek upon it, and hushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) up with lulling words, just as if
Cynthia were a little child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it is such a comfort to have told you all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>murmured Cynthia.
And Molly made reply,--<div class="bookquote">``I am sure we have right on our side; and that
makes me certain he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must and shall give up the letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And take the money?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>added Cynthia, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head, and looking
eagerly into Molly's face. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must take the money. Oh, Molly, you
can never manage it all without its coming out to your father! And I
would far rather go out to Russia as a governess. I almost think I
would rather--no, not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), shuddering away from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was going to say. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must not know--please, Molly, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must not
know. I couldn't bear it. I don't know what I might not do. You'll
promise me never to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),--or mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never will. You do not think I would for anything short of
saving--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was going to have said, <div class="bookquote">``saving you and Roger from
pain.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But Cynthia broke in,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For nothing. No reason whatever must make you tell your father. If
you fail, you fail, and I will love you for ever for trying; but I
shall be no worse off than before. Better, indeed; for I shall have
the comfort of your sympathy. But promise me not to tell Mr. Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have promised once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``but I promise again; so now do
go to bed, and try and rest. You are looking as white as a sheet;
you'll be ill if you don't get some rest; and it's past two o'clock,
and you're shivering with cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So they wished each other good-night. But when Molly got into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
room all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spirit left her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) threw herself down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bed,
dressed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had no heart left for anything. If Roger
ever heard of it all by any chance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt how it would disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
love for Cynthia. And yet was it right to conceal it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
must try and persuade Cynthia to tell it all straight out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) returned to England. A full confession on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) part would
wonderfully lessen any pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might have on first hearing of it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) lost herself in thoughts of Roger--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would feel, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
would say, how that meeting would come to pass, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was at that
very time, and so on, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) suddenly plucked herself up, and
recollected what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) herself had offered and promised to do. Now that
the first fervour was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) saw the difficulties clearly; and the
foremost of all was how she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was to manage to have an interview with
Mr. Preston. How had Cynthia managed? and the letters that had passed
between them too? Unwillingly, Molly was compelled to perceive that
there must have been a great deal of underhand work going on beneath
Cynthia's apparent openness of behaviour; and still more unwillingly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) began to be afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) herself might be led into the
practice. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would try and walk in a straight path; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
did wander out of it, it should only be to save pain to those whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) loved.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIV.

<p/>MOLLY GIBSON TO THE RESCUE.


<p/>It seemed curious enough, after the storms of the night, to meet in
smooth tranquillity at breakfast. Cynthia was pale; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) talked as
quietly as usual about all manner of indifferent things, while Molly
sate silent, watching and wondering, and becoming convinced that
Cynthia must have gone through a long experience of concealing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
real thoughts and secret troubles before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could have been able to
put on such a semblance of composure. Among the letters that came
in that morning was one from the London Kirkpatricks; but not from
Helen, Cynthia's own particular correspondent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sister wrote
to apologize for Helen, who was not well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said: had had the
influenza, which had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) very weak and poorly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) come down here for change of air,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``The
country at this time of the year is better than London, except when
the place is surrounded by trees. Now our house is well drained, high
up, gravel-soil, and I'll undertake to doctor her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, rapidly revolving in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind the changes necessary in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) household economy before
receiving a young lady accustomed to such a household as Mr.
Kirkpatrick's,--calculating the consequent inconveniences, and
weighing them against the probable advantages, even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Should not you like it, Cynthia? and Molly too? You then, dear,
would become acquainted with one of the girls, and I have no doubt
you would be asked back again, which would be so very nice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shouldn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, who had acquired an
unfortunate facility of reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife's thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Helen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>went on Mrs. Gibson, <div class="bookquote">``I should so like to nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)! We
would make your consulting-room into her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own private sitting-room,
my dear.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>---LRB-It is hardly necessary to say that the scales had been
weighed down by the inconveniences of having a person behind the
scenes for several weeks-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``For with an invalid so much depends on
tranquillity. In the drawing-room, for instance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) might constantly
be disturbed by callers; and the dining-room is so--so what shall I
call it? so dinnery,--the smell of meals never seems to leave it; it
would have been different if dear papa had allowed me to throw out
that window--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) have the dressing-room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) bedroom, and the little
room opening out of the drawing-room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sitting-room?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>asked Mr.
Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The library,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>for by this name Mrs. Gibson chose to dignify what had
formerly been called the book-closet--<div class="bookquote">``why, it would hardly hold a
sofa, besides the books and the writing-table; and there are draughts
everywhere. No, my dear, we had better not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) at all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own
home is comfortable at any rate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was to be worsted, and
not caring enough about the matter to show fight. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you're
right. It's a case of luxury _versus_ fresh air. Some people suffer
more from want of the one than from want of the other. You know I
shall be glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) likes to come, and take us as we are,
but I can't give up the consulting-room. It's a necessity; our daily
bread!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll write and tell them how kind Mr. Gibson is,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife in
high contentment, as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband left the room. <div class="bookquote">``They'll be just as
much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen/Helen Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Whether it was Helen's illness, or from some other cause, after
breakfast Cynthia became very flat and absent, and this lasted all
day long. Molly understood now why her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) moods had been so changeable
for many months, and was tender and forbearing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) accordingly.
Towards evening, when the two girls were left alone, Cynthia came and
stood over Molly, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) face could not be seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``will you do it? Will you do what you said last
night? I've been thinking of it all day, and sometimes I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
would give you back the letters if you asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might fancy--at
any rate it's worth trying, if you don't very much dislike it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Now it so happened that with every thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had given to it, Molly
disliked the idea of the proposed interview with Mr. Preston more and
more; but it was, after all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own offer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) neither could nor
would draw back from it; it might do good; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not see how it
could possibly do harm. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) consent, and tried to conceal
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) distaste, which grew upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) more and more as Cynthia hastily
arranged the details.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in the avenue leading from the park lodge up to
the Towers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) can come in one way from the Towers, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) has
often business--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) has pass-keys everywhere--you can go in as we have
often done by the lodge--you need not go far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>It did strike Molly that Cynthia must have had some experience in
making all these arrangements; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ventured to ask how he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was
to be informed of all this. Cynthia only reddened and replied, <div class="bookquote">``Oh!
never mind! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) will only be too glad to come; you heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) say
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wished to discuss the affair more; it is the first time the
appointment has come from my side. If I can but once be free--oh,
Molly, I will love you, and be grateful to you all my life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly thought of Roger, and that thought prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) next speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be horrible--I think I'm very brave--but I don't think I
could have--could have accepted even Roger, with a half-cancelled
engagement hanging over me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) blushed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget how I detest Mr. Preston!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``It was that,
more than any excess of love for Roger, that made me thankful to be
at least as securely pledged to some one else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not want to
call it an engagement, but I did; because it gave me the feeling of
assurance that I was free from Mr. Preston. And so I am! all but
these letters. Oh! if you can but make him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) take back his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) abominable
money, and get me my letters! Then we would bury it all in oblivion,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) could marry somebody else, and I would marry Roger, and no one
would be the wiser. After all, it was only what people call `youthful
folly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>And you may tell Mr. Preston that as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) makes my
letters public, shows them to your father or anything, I'll go away
from Hollingford, and never come back.''

<p/>Loaded with many such messages, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) should never
deliver, not really knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) should say, hating the errand,
not satisfied with Cynthia's manner of speaking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) relations
to Roger, oppressed with shame and complicity in conduct which
appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) deceitful, yet willing to bear all and brave all,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could once set Cynthia in a straight path--in a clear space,
and almost more pitiful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) friend's great distress and possible
disgrace, than able to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) that love which involves perfect
sympathy, Molly set out on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) walk towards the appointed place. It
was a cloudy, blustering day, and the noise of the blowing wind among
the nearly leafless branches of the great trees filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ears, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) passed through the park-gates and entered the avenue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) walked
quickly, instinctively wishing to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) blood up, and have no time
for thought. But there was a bend in the avenue about a quarter of a
mile from the lodge; after that bend it was a straight line up to the
great house, now emptied of its inhabitants. Molly did not like going
quite out of sight of the lodge, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stood facing it, close by
the trunk of one of the trees. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard a step coming over
the grass. It was Mr. Preston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) saw a woman's figure, half-behind
the trunk of a tree, and made no doubt that it was Cynthia. But
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) came nearer, almost close, the figure turned round, and,
instead of the brilliantly coloured face of Cynthia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) met the pale
resolved look of Molly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not speak to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); but though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) felt sure from the general aspect of pallor and timidity that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) steady gray eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) with courageous
innocence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Cynthia unable to come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), perceiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) expected
him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know you thought that you should meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, a
little surprised. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) simplicity she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had believed that Cynthia had
named that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), Molly Gibson, who would meet Mr. Preston at a
given time and place; but Cynthia had been too worldly-wise for that,
and had decoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) thither by a vaguely worded note, which, while
avoiding actual falsehood, had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) herself
would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) the meeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) should be here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Preston, extremely annoyed at
being entrapped, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) now felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had been, into an interview
with Miss Gibson. Molly hesitated a little before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was
determined not to break the silence; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had intruded herself into
the affair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should find her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) situation as awkward as possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sent me here to meet you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has told
me exactly how matters stand between you and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>sneered he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is not always the most open or reliable
person in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly reddened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) perceived the impertinence of the tone; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
temper was none of the coolest. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mastered herself and gained
courage by so doing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not speak so of the person you profess to wish to have
for your wife. But putting all that aside, you have some letters of
hers that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wishes to have back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that you have no right to keep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No legal, or no moral right? which do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know; simply you have no right at all, as a gentleman, to
keep a girl's letters when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asks for them back again, much less to
hold them over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as a threat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you do know all, Miss Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) manner to
one of more respect. <div class="bookquote">``At least she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) has told you her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) story from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
point of view, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) side; now you must hear mine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) promised me as
solemnly as ever woman--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not a woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was only a girl, barely sixteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old enough to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was doing; but I'll call her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) a girl if
you like. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) promised me solemnly to be my wife, making the one
stipulation of secrecy, and a certain period of waiting; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wrote
me letters repeating this promise, and confidential enough to prove
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) considered herself bound to me by such an implied relation.
I don't give in to humbug--I don't set myself up as a saint--and in
most ways I can look after my own interests pretty keenly; you know
enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) position as a penniless girl, and at that time, with
no influential connections to take the place of wealth, and help me
on in the world, it was as sincere and unworldly a passion as ever
man felt; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) must say so herself. I might have married two or three
girls with plenty of money; one of them was handsome enough, and not
at all reluctant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was chafed at the conceit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) manner.
<div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, but I do not want to hear accounts of young
ladies whom you might have married; I come here simply on behalf of
Cynthia, who does not like you, and who does not wish to marry you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I must make her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) `like' me, as you call it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did
`like' me once, and made promises which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) will find it requires the
consent of two people to break. I don't despair of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) love me
as much as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) letters, at least, when we
are married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) will never marry you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, firmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ever honours any one else with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) preference, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) shall
be allowed the perusal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) letters to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly almost could have laughed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was so secure and certain
that Roger would never read letters offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) under these
circumstances; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would feel such pain at
the whole affair, and at the contact with Mr. Preston, especially if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had not heard of it from Cynthia first, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), Molly, could
save him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could settle what to say, Mr.
Preston spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said the other day that Cynthia was engaged. May I ask whom to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``you may not. You heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) say it was not an
engagement. It is not exactly; and if it were a full engagement, do
you think, after what you last said, I should tell you to whom? But
you may be sure of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would never read a line of your letters.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is too-- No! I won't speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) before you. You could never
understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that this mysterious `he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)' is a very fortunate person
to have such a warm defender in Miss Gibson, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is not at
all engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Preston, with so disagreeable a look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
face that Molly suddenly found herself on the point of bursting into
tears. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) rallied herself, and worked on--for Cynthia first, and
for Roger as well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No honourable man or woman will read your letters, and if any people
do read them, they will be so much ashamed of it that they won't dare
to speak of them. What use can they be of to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They contain Cynthia's reiterated promises of marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would rather leave Hollingford for ever, and go out to
earn her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) bread, than marry you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face fell a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) looked so bitterly mortified, that Molly
was almost sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) say that to you in cold blood? Do you know you are telling
me very hard truths, Miss Gibson? If they are truths, that is to
say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) continued, recovering himself a little. ``Young ladies are
very fond of the words `hate' and ``detest.<div class="bookquote">'' I've known many who have
applied them to men whom they were all the time hoping to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell about other people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``I only know that
Cynthia does--''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hesitated for a moment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
pain, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hesitated; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) brought it out--<div class="bookquote">``does as
nearly hate you as anybody like her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ever does hate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), repeating the words almost unconsciously,
seizing on anything to try and hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mortification.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, I should hate worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly in a low voice.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not attend much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was working the point of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) stick into the turf, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes were bent on it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So now would you mind sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) back the letters by me? I do
assure you that you cannot make her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) marry you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very simple, Miss Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), suddenly lifting up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you don't know that there is any other feeling
that can be gratified, except love. Have you never heard of revenge?
Cynthia has cajoled me with promises, and little as you or she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) may
believe me--well, it's no use speaking of that. I don't mean to let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) go unpunished. You may tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) that. I shall keep the letters,
and make use of them as I see fit when the occasion arises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was miserably angry with herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mismanagement of the
affair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had hoped to succeed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had only made matters worse.
What new argument could she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) use? Meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went on, lashing
himself up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thought how the two girls must have talked him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) over,
bringing in wounded vanity to add to the rage of disappointed love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Osborne Hamley may hear of their contents, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) may be too

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I won't hear anything out of these letters,
written, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was almost without friends, to you, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) looked
upon as a friend! But I have thought of what I will do next. I give
you fair warning. If I had not been foolish, I should have told my
father, but Cynthia made me promise that I would not. So I will tell
it all, from beginning to end, to Lady Harriet, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to speak
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father. I feel sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will do it; and I don't think you
will dare to refuse Lord Cumnor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should not dare; that, clever land-agent as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was, and high up in the earl's favour on that account, yet that
the conduct of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been guilty in regard to the letters, and
the threats which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had held out respecting them, were just what
no gentleman, no honourable man, no manly man, could put up with in
any one about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), the
girl standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), had been clever enough to find it out. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
forgot himself for an instant in admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). There she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stood,
frightened, yet brave, not letting go her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hold on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) meant to
do, even when things seemed most against her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and besides, there was
something that struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most of all perhaps, and which shows the
kind of man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceived that Molly was as unconscious that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a young man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a young woman, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been a pure
angel of heaven. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) would have to yield, and give
up the letters, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was not going to do it at once; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was
thinking what to say, so as still to evade making any concession till
he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had had time to think over it, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) quick senses all about
him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), heard the trotting of a horse cranching quickly along over the
gravel of the drive. A moment afterwards, Molly's perception overtook
his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) could see the startled look overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face; and in an
instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have run away, but before the first rush was made,
Mr. Preston laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) hand firmly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep quiet. You must be seen. You, at any rate, have done nothing to
be ashamed of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) spoke, Mr. Sheepshanks came round the bend of the road and was
close upon them. Mr. Preston saw, if Molly did not, the sudden look
of intelligence that dawned upon the shrewd ruddy face of the old
gentleman--saw, but did not much heed. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went forwards and spoke to
Mr. Sheepshanks, who made a halt right before them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Gibson! your servant. Rather a blustering day for a young lady
to be out,--and cold, I should say, for standing still too long; eh,
Preston?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>poking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) whip at the latter in a knowing manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Preston; <div class="bookquote">``and I'm afraid I have kept Miss Gibson too
long standing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly did not know what to say or do; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only bowed a silent
farewell, and turned away to go home, feeling very heavy at heart at
the non-success of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) undertaking. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
conquered, in fact, although Mr. Preston might not as yet acknowledge
it even to himself. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was out of hearing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard Mr.
Sheepshanks say,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry to have disturbed your tête-à-tête, Preston,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sheepshanks/Sheepshanks</b></font>)</div>but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
heard the words, their implied sense did not sink into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was only feeling how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had gone out glorious and confident, and was
coming back to Cynthia defeated.

<p/>Cynthia was on the watch for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) return, and, rushing downstairs,
dragged Molly into the dining-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Molly? Oh! I see you haven't got them. After all, I
never expected it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sate down, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could get over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
disappointment better in that position, and Molly stood like a guilty
person before her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry; I did all I could; we were interrupted at last--Mr.
Sheepshanks rode up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Provoking old man! Do you think you should have persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) to
give up the letters if you had had more time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I wish Mr. Sheepshanks hadn't come up just then. I
didn't like his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) finding me standing talking to Mr. Preston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'d never think anything about it. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)--Mr.
Preston--say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) seemed to think you were fully engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), and that these
letters were the only proof he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) loves you in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) way, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, scornfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The more I think of it, the more I see it would be better for papa
to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). I did say I would tell it all to Lady Harriet, and
get Lord Cumnor to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) give up the letters. But it would be very
awkward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) would see it was only a
threat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I will do it in a moment, if you like. I meant what I said; only
I feel that papa would manage it best of all, and more privately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what, Molly--you're bound by a promise, you know, and
cannot tell Mr. Gibson without breaking your solemn word--but it's
just this: I'll leave Hollingford and never come back again, if ever
your father hears of this affair; there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia stood up now, and
began to fold up Molly's shawl, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) nervous excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cynthia--Roger!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>was all that Molly said.

<p/>``Yes, I know! you need not remind me of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). But I'm not going
to live in the house with any one who may be always casting up
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had heard against me--things--faults,
perhaps--which sound so much worse than they really are. I was so
happy when I first came here; you all liked me, and admired me, and
thought well of me, and now-- Why, Molly, I can see the difference
in you already. You carry your thoughts in your face--I have read
them there these two days--you've been thinking, ``How Cynthia must
have deceived me; keeping up a correspondence all this time--having
half-engagements to two men!<div class="bookquote">'' You've been more full of that than
of pity for me as a girl who has always been obliged to manage for
herself, without any friend to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was silent. There was a great deal of truth in what Cynthia was
saying: and yet a great deal of falsehood. For, through all this long
forty-eight hours, Molly had loved Cynthia dearly; and had been more
weighed down by the position the latter was in than Cynthia herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) also knew--but this was a second thought following on the
other--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had suffered much pain in trying to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) best
in this interview with Mr. Preston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had been tried beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
strength: and the great tears welled up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes, and fell
slowly down her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! what a brute I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, kissing them away. <div class="bookquote">``I see--I
know it is the truth, and I deserve it--but I need not reproach you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not reproach me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, trying to smile. <div class="bookquote">``I have
thought something of what you said--but I do love you dearly--dearly,
Cynthia--I should have done just the same as you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you would not. Your grain is different, somehow.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLV.

<p/>CONFIDENCES.


<p/>All the rest of that day Molly was depressed and not well. Having
anything to conceal was so unusual--almost so unprecedented a
circumstance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that it preyed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in every way.

<p/>It was a nightmare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not shake off; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did so wish to
forget it all, and yet every little occurrence seemed to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
of it. The next morning's post brought several letters; one from
Roger for Cynthia, and Molly, letterless herself, looked at Cynthia
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) read it, with wistful sadness. It appeared to Molly as though
Cynthia should have no satisfaction in these letters, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) exact position with Mr. Preston; yet Cynthia
was colouring and dimpling up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) always did at any pretty words
of praise, or admiration, or love. But Molly's thoughts and Cynthia's
reading were both interrupted by a little triumphant sound from Mrs.
Gibson, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) pushed a letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had just received to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) husband,
with a--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! I must say I expected that!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>Then, turning to Cynthia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
explained--<div class="bookquote">``It is a letter from uncle Kirkpatrick, love. So kind,
wishing you to go and stay with them, and help them to cheer up
Helen; poor Helen! I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is very far from well. But
we could not have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) here, without disturbing dear papa in
his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) consulting-room; and, though I could have relinquished my
dressing-room--he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)--well! so I said in my letter how you were
grieved--you above all of us, because you are such a friend of
Helen's, you know--and how you longed to be of use,--as I am sure you
do--and so now they want you to go up directly, for Helen has quite
set her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) heart upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia's eyes sparkled. <div class="bookquote">``I shall like going,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``all but
leaving you, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) added, in a lower tone, as if suddenly
smitten with some compunction.

<p/>``Can you be ready to go by the ``Bang-up' to-night?'' said Mr. Gibson;
<div class="bookquote">``for, curiously enough, after more than twenty years of quiet
practice at Hollingford, I am summoned up to-day for the first time
to a consultation in London to-morrow. I'm afraid Lady Cumnor is
worse, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say so? Poor dear lady! What a shock it is to me! I'm so
glad I've had some breakfast. I could not have eaten anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I only say she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is worse. With her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) complaint, being worse may be
only a preliminary to being better. Don't take my words for more than
their literal meaning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. How kind and reassuring dear papa always is! About your
gowns, Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they're all right, mamma, thank you. I shall be quite ready by
four o'clock. Molly, will you come with me and help me to pack? I
wanted to speak to you, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), as soon as they had gone
upstairs. <div class="bookquote">``It is such a relief to get away from a place haunted by
that man; but I'm afraid you thought I was glad to leave you; and
indeed I am not.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a little flavour of <div class="bookquote">``protesting too much''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>about this; but Molly did not perceive it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed
I did not. I know from my own feelings how you must dislike meeting
a man in public in a different manner from what you have done in
private. I shall try not to see Mr. Preston again for a long, long
time, I'm sure. But, Cynthia, you haven't told me one word out of
Roger's letter. Please, how is he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) quite got over his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) attack
of fever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, quite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) writes in very good spirits. A great deal about birds
and beasts, as usual, habits of natives, and things of that kind. You
may read from there''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-indicating a place in the letter-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``to there, if
you can. And I'll tell you what, I'll trust you with it, Molly, while
I pack; and that shows my sense of your honour--not but what you
might read it all, only you'd find the love-making dull; but make a
little account of where he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is doing, date, and that
sort of thing, and send it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly took the letter down without a word, and began to copy it at
the writing-table; often reading over what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was allowed to read;
often pausing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cheek on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes on the letter, and
letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) imagination rove to the writer, and all the scenes in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had either seen him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) herself, or in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fancy had
painted him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was startled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) meditations by Cynthia's
sudden entrance into the drawing-room, looking the picture of glowing
delight. <div class="bookquote">``No one here? What a blessing! Ah, Miss Molly, you are more
eloquent than you believe yourself. Look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>holding up a large
full envelope, and then quickly replacing it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pocket, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was afraid of being seen. <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, sweet one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>coming
up and caressing Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Is it worrying itself over that letter?
Why, don't you see these are my very own horrible letters, that I
am going to burn directly, that Mr. Preston has had the grace to
send me, thanks to you, little Molly--cuishla ma chree, pulse of
my heart,--the letters that have been hanging over my head like
somebody's sword for these two years?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am so glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, rousing up a little. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) would have sent them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) is better than I believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>). And now it
is all over. I am so glad! You quite think he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) means to give up all
claim over you by this, don't you, Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) may claim, but I won't be claimed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) has no proofs now. It
is the most charming relief; and I owe it all to you, you precious
little lady! Now there's only one thing more to be done; and if you
would but do it for me--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-coaxing and caressing while she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) asked the
question-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cynthia, don't ask me; I cannot do any more. You don't know how
sick I go when I think of yesterday, and Mr. Sheepshanks' look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only a very little thing. I won't burden your conscience with
telling you how I got my letters, but it is not through a person
I can trust with money; and I must force him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) to take back his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>)
twenty-three pounds odd shillings. I have put it together at the rate
of five per cent., and it's sealed up. Oh, Molly, I should go off
with such a light heart if you would only try to get it safely to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>). It's the last thing; there would be no immediate hurry, you
know. You might meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) by chance in a shop, in the street, even at
a party--and if you only had it with you in your pocket, there would
be nothing so easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was silent. <div class="bookquote">``Papa would give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>). There would be no harm
in that. I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) must ask no questions as to what it
was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, <div class="bookquote">``have it your own way. I think my way is
the best: for if any of this affair comes out-- But you've done a
great deal for me already, and I won't blame you now for declining to
do any more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do so dislike having these underhand dealings with him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>pleaded
Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Underhand! just simply giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) a letter from me! If I left a note
for Miss Browning, should you dislike giving it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that's very different. I could do it openly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet there might be writing in that; and there wouldn't be a
line with the money. It would only be the winding-up--the honourable,
honest winding-up of an affair which has worried me for years. But do
as you like!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I will try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a darling! You can but try; and if you can't give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
in private, without getting yourself into a scrape, why, keep it till
I come back again. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shall have it then, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will or no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly looked forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) two days alone with Mrs. Gibson with very
different anticipations from those with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had welcomed the
similar intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father. In the first place, there was no
accompanying the travellers to the inn from which the coach started;
leave-taking in the market-place was quite out of the bounds of Mrs.
Gibson's sense of propriety. Besides this, it was a gloomy, rainy
evening, and candles had to be brought in at an unusually early hour.
There would be no break for six hours--no music, no reading; but
the two ladies would sit at their worsted work, pattering away at
small-talk, with not even the usual break of dinner; for, to suit
the requirements of those who were leaving, they had already dined
early. But Mrs. Gibson really meant to make Molly happy, and tried to
be an agreeable companion, only Molly was not well, and was uneasy
about many apprehended cares and troubles--and at such hours of
indisposition as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was then passing through, apprehensions take
the shape of certainties, lying await in our paths. Molly would have
given a good deal to have shaken off all these feelings, unusual
enough to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); but the very house and furniture, and rain-blurred
outer landscape, seemed steeped with unpleasant associations, most of
them dating from the last few days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and I must go on the next journey, I think, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gibson, almost chiming in with Molly's wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could get away
from Hollingford into some new air and life, for a week or two. ``We
have been stay-at-homes for a long time, and variety of scene is so
desirable for the young! But I think the travellers will be wishing
themselves at home by this nice bright fireside. ``There's no place
like home,'' as the poet says. ``Mid pleasures and palaces although I
may roam,<div class="bookquote">'' it begins, and it's both very pretty and very true. It's a
great blessing to have such a dear little home as this, is not it,
Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, rather drearily, having something of the <div class="bookquote">``toujours
perdrix''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>feeling at the moment. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could but have gone away with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, just for two days, how pleasant it would have been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, love, it would be very nice for you and me to go a
little journey all by ourselves. You and I. No one else. If it
were not such miserable weather we would have gone off on a little
impromptu tour. I've been longing for something of the kind for some
weeks; but we live such a restricted kind of life here! I declare
sometimes I get quite sick of the very sight of the chairs and tables
that I know so well. And one misses the others too! It seems so flat
and deserted without them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! We are very forlorn to-night; but I think it's partly owing to
the weather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, dear. I can't have you giving in to the silly fancy of
being affected by weather. Poor dear Mr. Kirkpatrick used to say, 'a
cheerful heart makes its own sunshine.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would say it to me, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pretty way, whenever I was a little low--for I am a complete
barometer--you may really judge of the state of the weather by my
spirits, I have always been such a sensitive creature! It is well
for Cynthia that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) does not inherit it; I don't think her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) easily
affected in any way, do you?''

<p/>Molly thought for a minute or two, and then replied--<div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
certainly is not easily affected--not deeply affected perhaps I
should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Many girls, for instance, would have been touched by the admiration
she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) excited--I may say the attentions she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) received when she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was at
her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) uncle's last summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Mr. Kirkpatrick's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. There was Mr. Henderson, that young lawyer; that's to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)
is studying law, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) has a good private fortune and is likely
to have more, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) can only be what I call playing at law. Mr.
Henderson was over head and ears in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>). It is not my
fancy, although I grant mothers are partial: both Mr. and Mrs.
Kirkpatrick noticed it; and in one of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's letters,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) said that poor Mr. Henderson was going into Switzerland for the
long vacation, doubtless to try and forget Cynthia; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) really
believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) would find it only `dragging at each remove a lengthening
chain.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought it such a refined quotation, and altogether worded
so prettily. You must know aunt Kirkpatrick some day, Molly, my love;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is what I call a woman of a truly elegant mind.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help thinking it was a pity that Cynthia did not tell them
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not an engagement, my dear! How often must I tell you that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what am I to call it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I don't see why you need to call it anything. Indeed, I don't
understand what you mean by ``it.<div class="bookquote">'' You should always try to express
yourself intelligibly. It really is one of the first principles
of the English language. In fact, philosophers might ask what is
language given us for at all, if it is not that we may make our
meaning understood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is something between Cynthia and Roger; they are more to
each other than I am to Osborne, for instance. What am I to call it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not couple your name with that of any unmarried young
man; it is so difficult to teach you delicacy, child. Perhaps one may
say there is a peculiar relation between dear Cynthia and Roger, but
it is very difficult to characterize it; I have no doubt that is the
reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) shrinks from speaking about it. For, between ourselves,
Molly, I really sometimes think it will come to nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is
so long away, and, privately speaking, Cynthia is not very, very
constant. I once knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) very much taken before--that little affair
is quite gone by; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was very civil to Mr. Henderson, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
way; I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) inherits it, for when I was a girl I was beset by
lovers, and could never find in my heart to shake them off. You have
not heard dear papa say anything of the old Squire, or dear Osborne,
have you? It seems so long since we have heard or seen anything of
Osborne. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) must be quite well, I think, or we should have heard
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is quite well. Some one said the other day that they
had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) riding--it was Mrs. Goodenough, now I remember--and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was looking stronger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had done for years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! I am truly glad to hear it. I always was fond of Osborne;
and, do you know, I never really took to Roger? I respected him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
and all that, of course; but to compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) with Mr. Henderson! Mr.
Henderson is so handsome and well-bred, and gets all his (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) gloves from
Houbigant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>It was true that they had not seen anything of Osborne Hamley for
a long time; but, as it often happens, just after they had been
speaking about him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) appeared. It was on the day following Mr.
Gibson's departure that Mrs. Gibson received one of the notes, not
so common now as formerly, from the family in town, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to go
over to the Towers, and find a book, or a manuscript, or something or
other that Lady Cumnor wanted with all an invalid's impatience. It
was just the kind of employment she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) required for an amusement on a
gloomy day, and it put her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) into a good humour immediately. There was
a certain confidential importance about it, and it was a variety, and
it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) the pleasant drive in a fly up the noble avenue, and the
sense of being the temporary mistress of all the grand rooms once so
familiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) asked Molly to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), out of an access
of kindness, but was not at all sorry when Molly excused herself and
preferred stopping at home. At eleven o'clock Mrs. Gibson was off,
all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) Sunday best -LRB-to use the servant's expression, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
herself would so have contemned-RRB-, well-dressed in order to impose on
the servants at the Towers, for there was no one else to see or to be
seen by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not be at home until the afternoon, my dear! But I hope you
will not find it dull. I don't think you will, for you are something
like me, my love--never less alone than when alone, as one of the
great authors has justly expressed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly enjoyed the house to herself fully as much as Mrs. Gibson would
enjoy having the Towers to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ventured on having her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lunch
brought upon a tray into the drawing-room, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might eat
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sandwiches while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) book. In the middle, Mr.
Osborne Hamley was announced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) came in, looking wretchedly ill in
spite of purblind Mrs. Goodenough's report of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) healthy appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This call is not on you, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), after the first greetings
were over. <div class="bookquote">``I was in hopes I might have found your father at home;
I thought lunch-time was the best hour.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had sate down, as if
thoroughly glad of the rest, and fallen into a languid stooping
position, as if it had become so natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) that no sense of what
were considered good manners sufficed to restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you did not want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) professionally?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly,
wondering if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was wise in alluding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) health, yet urged to it
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) real anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did. I suppose I may help myself to a biscuit and a glass of
wine? No, don't ring for more. I could not eat it if it was here. But
I just want a mouthful; this is quite enough, thank you. When will
your father be back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was summoned up to London. Lady Cumnor is worse. I fancy there is
some operation going on; but I don't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be back to-morrow
night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Then I must wait. Perhaps I shall be better by that time.
I think it's half fancy; but I should like your father to tell me so.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will laugh at me, I daresay; but I don't think I shall mind that.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always is severe on fanciful patients, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly thought that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) saw Osborne's looks just then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) would
hardly think him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) fanciful, or be inclined to be severe. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only
said,--<div class="bookquote">``Papa enjoys a joke at everything, you know. It is a relief
after all the sorrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) sees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true. There is a great deal of sorrow in the world. I don't
think it's a very happy place after all. So Cynthia is gone to
London?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) added, after a pause. <div class="bookquote">``I think I should like to have seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) again. Poor old Roger! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) very dearly, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) said.
Molly hardly knew how to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) in all this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was so struck by
the change in both voice and manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma has gone to the Towers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began, at length. <div class="bookquote">``Lady Cumnor
wanted several things that mamma only can find. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) will be sorry to
miss you. We were speaking of you only yesterday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) said how
long it was since we had seen you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I've grown careless; I've often felt so weary and ill that
it was all I could do to keep up a brave face before my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you not come and see papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``or write to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell. I drifted on, sometimes better, and sometimes worse,
till to-day I mustered up pluck, and came to hear what your father
has got to tell me: and all for no use it seems.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry. But it is only for two days. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shall go and see
you as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) returns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must not alarm my father, remember, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Osborne, lifting
himself by the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) chair into an upright position and
speaking eagerly for the moment. <div class="bookquote">``I wish to God Roger was at home!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), falling back into the old posture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help understanding you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``You think yourself
very ill; but isn't it that you are tired just now?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was not sure
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ought to have understood what was passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mind; but as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not help speaking a true reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sometimes I do think I'm very ill; and then, again, I think
it's only the moping life sets me fancying and exaggerating.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was
silent for some time. Then, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had taken a sudden resolution,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) spoke again. <div class="bookquote">``You see, there are others depending upon me--upon my
health. You haven't forgotten what you heard that day in the library
at home? No, I know you haven't. I have seen the thought of it in
your eyes often since then. I didn't know you at that time. I think I
do now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go on talking so fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Rest. No one will
interrupt us; I will go on with my sewing; when you want to say
anything more I shall be listening.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was alarmed at the
strange pallor that had come over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) roused himself, and began to speak very
quietly, as if on an indifferent matter of fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The name of my wife is Aimée. Aimée Hamley, of course. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lives
at Bishopsfield, a village near Winchester. Write it down, but keep
it to yourself. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is a Frenchwoman, a Roman Catholic, and was a
servant. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is a thoroughly good woman. I must not say how dear she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
is to me. I dare not. I meant once to have told Cynthia, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
didn't seem quite to consider me as a brother. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was shy of
a new relation; but you'll give my love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), all the same. It is
a relief to think that some one else has my secret; and you are like
one of us, Molly. I can trust you almost as I can trust Roger. I feel
better already, now I feel that some one else knows the whereabouts
of my wife and child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, surprised. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) could reply, Maria had
announced, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Phoebe Browning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fold up that paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), quickly, putting something into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
hands. <div class="bookquote">``It is only for yourself.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLVI.

<p/>HOLLINGFORD GOSSIPS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Molly, why didn't you come and dine with us? I said to
sister I would come and scold you well. Oh, Mr. Osborne Hamley, is
that you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and a look of mistaken intelligence at the tête-à-tête
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had disturbed came so perceptibly over Miss Phoebe's face that
Molly caught Osborne's sympathetic eye, and both smiled at the
notion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I--well! one must sometimes--I see our dinner would have
been--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) recovered herself into a connected sentence. ``We
only just heard of Mrs. Gibson's having a fly from the ``George,''
because sister sent our Nancy to pay for a couple of rabbits Tom
Ostler had snared, -LRB-I hope we shan't be taken up for poachers, Mr.
Osborne--snaring doesn't require a licence, I believe?-RRB- and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) heard
he (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was gone off with the fly to the Towers with your dear mamma; for
Coxe who drives the fly in general has sprained his (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) ankle. We had
just finished dinner, but when Nancy said Tom Ostler would not be
back till night, I said, ``Why, there's that poor dear girl left all
alone by herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother such a friend of ours,<div class="bookquote">''--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)
was alive, I mean. But I'm sure I'm glad I'm mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Osborne said,--<div class="bookquote">``I came to speak to Mr. Gibson, not knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
gone to London, and Miss Gibson kindly gave me some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lunch.
I must go now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear! I am so sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>fluttered out Miss Phoebe, <div class="bookquote">``I disturbed
you; but it was with the best intentions. I always was mal-àpropos
from a child.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>But Osborne was gone before she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
apologies. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ostler</b></font>) left, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ostler</b></font>) eyes met Molly's with a strange look
of yearning farewell that struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at the time, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
remembered strongly afterwards. <div class="bookquote">``Such a nice suitable thing, and I
came in the midst, and spoilt it all. I am sure you're very kind, my
dear, considering--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Considering what, my dear Miss Phoebe? If you are conjecturing a
love affair between Mr. Osborne Hamley and me, you never were more
mistaken in your life. I think I told you so once before. Please do
believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! I remember. And somehow sister got it into her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head it was
Mr. Preston. I recollect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One guess is just as wrong as the other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, smiling, and
trying to look perfectly indifferent, but going extremely red at the
mention of Mr. Preston's name. It was very difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to keep
up any conversation, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart was full of Osborne--his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) changed
appearance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) melancholy words of foreboding, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) confidences
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) wife--French, Catholic, servant. Molly could not help
trying to piece these strange facts together by imaginations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
own, and found it very hard work to attend to kind Miss Phoebe's
unceasing patter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) came up to the point, however, when the voice
ceased; and could recall, in a mechanical manner, the echo of the
last words, which both from Miss Phoebe's look, and the dying
accent that lingered in Molly's ear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) perceived to be a question.
Miss Phoebe was asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) would go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was
going to Grinstead's, the bookseller of Hollingford; who, in addition
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grinstead</b></font>) regular business, was the agent for the Hollingford Book
Society, received their subscriptions, kept their accounts, ordered
their books from London, and, on payment of a small salary, allowed
the Society to keep their volumes on shelves in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grinstead</b></font>) shop. It was
the centre of news, and the club, as it were, of the little town.
Everybody who pretended to gentility in the place belonged to it. It
was a test of gentility, indeed, rather than of education or a love
of literature. No shopkeeper would have thought of offering himself
as a member, however great his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) general intelligence and love of
reading; while it boasted on its list of subscribers most of the
county families in the neighbourhood, some of whom subscribed to it
as a sort of duty belonging to their station, without often using
their privilege of reading the books: while there were residents
in the little town, such as Mrs. Goodenough, who privately thought
reading a great waste of time, that might be much better employed
in sewing, and knitting, and pastry-making, but who nevertheless
belonged to it as a mark of station, just as these good, motherly
women would have thought it a terrible come-down in the world if they
had not had a pretty young servant-maid to fetch them home from the
tea-parties at night. At any rate, Grinstead's was a very convenient
place for a lounge. In that view of the Book Society every one
agreed.

<p/>Molly went upstairs to get ready to accompany Miss Phoebe; and on
opening one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) drawers she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) saw Cynthia's envelope, containing
the money she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) owed to Mr. Preston, carefully sealed up like a letter.
This was what Molly had so unwillingly promised to deliver--the last
final stroke to the affair. Molly took it up, hating it. For a time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had forgotten it; and now it was here, facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must
try and get rid of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pocket for the chances
of the walk and the day, and fortune for once seemed to befriend
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); for, on their entering Grinstead's shop, in which two or three
people were now, as always, congregated, making play of examining the
books, or business of writing down the titles of new works in the
order-book, there was Mr. Preston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) bowed as they came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) could
not help that; but, at the sight of Molly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) looked as ill-tempered
and out of humour as a man well could do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was connected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
mind with defeat and mortification; and besides, the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
called up what he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) desired now, above all things, to forget; namely,
the deep conviction, received through Molly's simple earnestness,
of Cynthia's dislike to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>). If Miss Phoebe had seen the scowl upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) handsome face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) might have undeceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister in her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>)
suppositions about him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) and Molly. But Miss Phoebe, who did not
consider it quite maidenly to go and stand close to Mr. Preston, and
survey the shelves of books in such close proximity to a gentleman,
found herself an errand at the other end of the shop, and occupied
herself in buying writing-paper. Molly fingered her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) valuable letter,
as it lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pocket; did she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dare to cross over to Mr. Preston,
and give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), or not? While she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was still undecided, shrinking
always just at the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) courage
up for action, Miss Phoebe, having finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) purchase, turned
round, and after looking a little pathetically at Mr. Preston's back,
said to Molly in a whisper--<div class="bookquote">``I think we'll go to Johnson's now, and
come back for the books in a little while.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>So across the street to
Johnson's they went; but no sooner had they entered the draper's
shop, than Molly's conscience smote her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cowardice, and loss
of a good opportunity. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be back directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), as soon as
Miss Phoebe was engaged with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) purchases; and Molly ran across to
Grinstead's, without looking either to the right or the left; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
been watching the door, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew that no Mr. Preston had issued
forth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ran in; he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was at the counter now, talking to Grinstead
himself; Molly put the letter into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grinstead</b></font>) hand, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grinstead</b></font>) surprise,
and almost against his (<font color='blue'><b>Grinstead</b></font>) will, and turned round to go back to Miss
Phoebe. At the door of the shop stood Mrs. Goodenough, arrested in
the act of entering, staring, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) round eyes, made still rounder
and more owl-like by spectacles, to see Molly Gibson giving Mr.
Preston a letter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), conscious of being watched, and favouring
underhand practices habitually, put quickly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) pocket,
unopened. Perhaps, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had had time for reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) would not
have scrupled to put Molly to open shame, by rejecting what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) so
eagerly forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>).

<p/>There was another long evening to be got through with Mrs. Gibson;
but on this occasion there was the pleasant occupation of dinner,
which took up at least an hour; for it was one of Mrs. Gibson's
fancies--one which Molly chafed against--to have every ceremonial
gone through in the same stately manner for two as for twenty. So,
although Molly knew full well, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother knew full well,
and Maria knew full well, that neither Mrs. Gibson nor Molly touched
dessert, it was set on the table with as much form as if Cynthia had
been at home, who delighted in almonds and raisins; or Mr. Gibson
been there, who never could resist dates, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) always protested
against <div class="bookquote">``persons in their station of life having a formal dessert set
out before them every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mrs. Gibson herself apologized, as it were, to Molly to-day,
in the same words she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had often used to Mr. Gibson,--<div class="bookquote">``It's no
extravagance, for we need not eat it--I never do. But it looks well,
and makes Maria understand what is required in the daily life of
every family of position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>All through the evening Molly's thoughts wandered far and wide,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) managed to keep up a show of attention to what Mrs.
Gibson was saying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was thinking of Osborne, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) abrupt,
half-finished confidence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ill-looks; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was wondering when
Roger would come home, and longing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) return, as much -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said
to herself-RRB- for Osborne's sake as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) checked
herself. What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to do with Roger? Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) long for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
return? It was Cynthia who was doing this; only somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was such
a true friend to Molly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not help thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as a
staff and a stay in the troublous times which appeared to lie not far
ahead--this evening. Then Mr. Preston and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) little adventure with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) came uppermost. How angry he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) looked! How could Cynthia have
liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) even enough to get into this abominable scrape, which
was, however, all over now! And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) ran on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) fancies and
imaginations, little dreaming that that very night much talk was
going on not half-a-mile from where she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sate sewing, that would prove
that the <div class="bookquote">``scrape''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) called it, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) girlish phraseology-RRB- was
not all over.

<p/>Scandal sleeps in the summer, comparatively speaking. Its nature is
the reverse of that of the dormouse. Warm ambient air, loiterings
abroad, gardenings, flowers to talk about, and preserves to make,
soothed the wicked imp to slumber in the parish of Hollingford in
summer-time. But when evenings grew short, and people gathered round
the fires, and put their feet in a circle--not on the fenders, that
was not allowed--then was the time for confidential conversation!
Or in the pauses allowed for the tea-trays to circulate among the
card-tables--when those who were peaceably inclined tried to stop
the warm discussions about <div class="bookquote">``the odd trick,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the rather wearisome
feminine way of <div class="bookquote">``shouldering the crutch, and showing how fields were
won'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--small crumbs and scraps of daily news came up to the surface,
such as <div class="bookquote">``Martindale has raised the price of his (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) best joints a
halfpenny in the pound;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or, <div class="bookquote">``It's a shame of Sir Harry to order in
another book on farriery into the Book Society; Phoebe and I tried
to read it, but really there is no general interest in it;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or, <div class="bookquote">``I
wonder what Mr. Ashton will do, now Nancy is going to be married!
Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'s been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) these seventeen years! It's a very foolish
thing for a woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) age to be thinking of matrimony; and so I
told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), when I met her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the market-place this morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>So said Miss Browning on the night in question; her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) hand of cards
lying by her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) on the puce baize-covered table, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) munched the
rich pound-cake of a certain Mrs. Dawes, lately come to inhabit
Hollingford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Matrimony's not so bad as you think for, Miss Browning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Goodenough, standing up for the holy estate into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) had twice
entered. <div class="bookquote">``If I'd ha' seen Nancy, I should ha' given her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) my mind very
different. It's a great thing to be able to settle what you'll have
for dinner, without never a one interfering with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that's all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, drawing herself up, <div class="bookquote">``I can do
that; and, perhaps, better than a woman who has a husband to please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>``No one can say as I didn't please my husbands--both on 'em, though
Jeremy was tickler in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeremy</b></font>) tastes than poor Harry Beaver. But as I
used to say to 'em, ``Leave the victual to me; it's better for you
than knowing what's to come beforehand. The stomach likes to be
taken by surprise.<div class="bookquote">'' And neither of 'em ever repented 'em of their
confidence. You may take my word for it, beans and bacon will taste
better -LRB-and Mr. Ashton's Nancy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) own house-RRB- than all the
sweetbreads and spring chickens she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'s been a-doing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) this
seventeen years. But if I chose, I could tell you of something as
would interest you all a deal more than old Nancy's marriage to a
widower with nine children--only as the young folks themselves is
meeting in private, clandestine-like, it's perhaps not for me to tell
their secrets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't want to hear of clandestine meetings between young
men and young women,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, throwing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It's
disgrace enough to the people themselves, I consider, if they enter
on a love affair without the proper sanction of parents. I know
public opinion has changed on the subject; but when poor Gratia was
married to Mr. Byerley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Byerley</b></font>) wrote to my father without ever having so
much as paid her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) a compliment, or said more than the most trivial and
commonplace things to her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>); and my father and mother sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) into
my father's study, and she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) was never so much frightened in
her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) life,--and they said it was a very good offer, and Mr. Byerley
was a very worthy man, and they hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) would behave properly to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Byerley</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Byerley</b></font>) came to supper that night. And after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Byerley</b></font>) was allowed
to come twice a week till they were married. My mother and I sate at
our work in the bow-window of the Rectory drawing-room, and Gratia
and Mr. Byerley at the other end; and my mother always called my
attention to some flower or plant in the garden when it struck nine,
for that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Byerley</b></font>) time for going. Without offence to the present
company, I am rather inclined to look upon matrimony as a weakness to
which some very worthy people are prone; but if they must be married,
let them make the best of it, and go through the affair with dignity
and propriety: or if there are misdoings and clandestine meetings,
and such things, at any rate, never let me hear about them! I think
it's you to play, Mrs. Dawes. You'll excuse my frankness on the
subject of matrimony! Mrs. Goodenough there can tell you I'm a very
out-spoken person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not the out-speaking, it's what you say that goes against me,
Miss Browning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Goodenough, affronted, yet ready to play
her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) card as soon as needed. And as for Mrs. Dawes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) was too
anxious to get into the genteelest of all -LRB-Hollingford-RRB- society to
object to whatever Miss Browning -LRB-who, in right of being a deceased
rector's daughter, rather represented the selectest circle of the
little town-RRB- advocated, whether celibacy, marriage, bigamy, or
polygamy.

<p/>So the remainder of the evening passed over without any further
reference to the secret Mrs. Goodenough was burning to disclose,
unless a remark made _àpropos de rien_ by Miss Browning, during the
silence of a deal, could be supposed to have connection with the
previous conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) said suddenly and abruptly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I have done that any man should make me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
slave.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) was referring to any prospect of matrimonial danger
she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) saw opening before her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) fancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) might have been comforted. But
it was a remark of which no one took any notice, all being far too
much engaged in the rubber. Only when Miss Browning took her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) early
leave -LRB-for Miss Phoebe had a cold, and was an invalid at home-RRB-,
Mrs. Goodenough burst out with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! now I may speak out my mind, and say as how if there was a
slave between us two, when Goodenough was alive, it wasn't me; and
I don't think as it was pretty in Miss Browning to give herself such
airs on her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) virginity when there was four widows in the room,--who've
had six honest men among 'em for husbands. No offence, Miss Airy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>addressing an unfortunate little spinster, who found herself the sole
representative of celibacy now that Miss Browning was gone. <div class="bookquote">``I could
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) of a girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)'s very fond on, who's on the high road to
matrimony; and in as cunning a way as ever I heerd on; going out at
dusk to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) sweetheart, just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) was my Sally, or your
Jenny. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) name is Molly too,--which, as I have often thought,
shows a low taste in them as first called her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) so;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) might as
well be a scullery-maid at oncest. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'s picked up anybody
common; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'s looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) for a handsome fellow, and a smart
young man enough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the hostess Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/>Every one around the table looked curious and intent on the
disclosures being made, except the hostess, Mrs. Dawes, who smiled
intelligence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) eyes, and knowingly pursed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) mouth until
Mrs. Goodenough had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) tale. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) said demurely,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you mean Mr. Preston and Miss Gibson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, who told you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Goodenough, turning round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>)
in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``You can't say as I did. There's many a Molly in
Hollingford, besides her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),--though none, perhaps, in such a genteel
station in life. I never named her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But I know. I could tell my tale too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Dawes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! could you, really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Goodenough, very curious and a
little jealous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. My uncle Sheepshanks came upon them in the Park Avenue,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>)
startled 'em a good deal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) said; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) taxed Mr. Preston with
being with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) sweetheart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) didn't deny it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Now so much has come out, I'll tell you what I know. Only,
ladies, I wouldn't wish to do the girl an unkind turn,--so you must
keep what I've got to tell you a secret.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Of course they promised;
that was easy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Hannah, as married Tom Oakes, and lives in Pearson's Lane,
was a-gathering of damsons only a week ago, and Molly Gibson was
a-walking fast down the lane,--quite in a hurry like to meet some
one,--and Hannah's little Anna-Maria fell down, and Molly -LRB-who's a
kind-hearted lass enough-RRB- picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) up; so if Hannah had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)
doubts before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) had none then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there was no one with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>), was there?''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>asked one of the ladies,
anxiously, as Mrs. Goodenough stopped to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) piece of cake,
just at this crisis.

<p/>``No: I said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) was going to meet some one,--and
by-and-by comes Mr. Preston running out of the wood just beyond
Hannah's, and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), ``A cup of water, please, good woman, for a
lady has fainted, or is `sterical or something.'' Now though he (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) didn't
know Hannah, Hannah knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>). ``More folks know Tom Fool, than Tom
Fool knows,<div class="bookquote">'' asking Mr. Preston's pardon; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s no fool whatever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) be. And I could tell you more,--and what I've seed with my
own eyes. I seed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) a letter in Grinstead's shop, only
yesterday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grinstead</b></font>) looked as black as thunder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Grinstead</b></font>) seed me
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Fool</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very suitable kind of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Airy; <div class="bookquote">``why do they
make such a mystery of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some folks like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dawes; <div class="bookquote">``it adds zest to it all, to do
their courting underhand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, it's like salt to their victual,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>put in Mrs. Goodenough. <div class="bookquote">``But I
didn't think Molly Gibson was one of that sort, I didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Gibsons hold themselves very high?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Dawes, more as an
inquiry than an assertion. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Gibson has called upon me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, you're like to be a patient of the doctor's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>put in Mrs.
Goodenough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) seemed to me very affable, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is so intimate with the
Countess and the family at the Towers; and is quite the lady herself;
dines late, I've heard, and everything in style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Style! very different style to what Bob Gibson, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, was
used to when first he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came here,--glad of a mutton-chop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
surgery, for I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'d a fire anywhere else; we called him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) Bob
Gibson then, but none on us dare Bob him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) now; I'd as soon think o'
calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sweep!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it looks very bad for Miss Gibson!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said one lady, rather
anxious to bring back the conversation to the more interesting
present time. But as soon as Mrs. Goodenough heard this natural
comment on the disclosures she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) had made, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) fired round on the
speaker:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all bad, and I'll trouble you not to use such a word as that
about Molly Gibson, as I've known all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) life. It's odd if you will.
I was odd myself as a girl; I never could abide a plate of gathered
gooseberries, but I must needs go and skulk behind a bush and gather
'em for myself. It's some folk's taste, though it mayn't be Miss
Browning's, who'd have all the courting done under the nose of the
family. All as ever I said was that I was surprised at it in Molly
Gibson; and that I'd ha' thought it was liker that pretty piece of a
Cynthia as they call her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); indeed, at one time I was ready to swear
as it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) Mr. Preston was after. And now, ladies, I'll wish you
a very good night. I cannot abide waste; and I'll venture for it
Sally's letting the candle in the lantern run all to grease, instead
of putting it out, as I've told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) to do, if ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s got to wait
for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>So with formal dipping curtseys the ladies separated, but not without
thanking Mrs. Dawes for the pleasant evening they had had; a piece of
old-fashioned courtesy always gone through in those days.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVII.

<p/>SCANDAL AND ITS VICTIMS.


<p/>When Mr. Gibson returned to Hollingford, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) found an accumulation of
business waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was much inclined to complain of the
consequences of the two days' comparative holiday, which had resulted
in over-work for the week to come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had hardly time to speak to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) family, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had so immediately to rush off to pressing cases of
illness. But Molly managed to arrest him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in the hall, standing there
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) great coat held out ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to put on, but whispering
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did so--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa! Mr. Osborne Hamley was here to see you yesterday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) looks
very ill, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s evidently frightened about himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson faced about, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for a moment; but all he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
said was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>); don't tell your mother where I'm gone: you've
not mentioned this to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had only told Mrs. Gibson of Osborne's
call, not of the occasion for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say anything about it; there's no need. Now I think of it, I
can't possibly go to-day,--but I will go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) father's manner disheartened Molly, who had
persuaded herself that Osborne's evident illness was partly
<div class="bookquote">``nervous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) meant imaginary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had dwelt upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks
of enjoyment at Miss Phoebe's perplexity, and thought that no one
really believing himself to be in danger could have given the merry
glances which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done; but after seeing the seriousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>)
father's face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) recurred to the shock she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) had experienced on first
seeing Osborne's changed appearance. All this time Mrs. Gibson was
busy reading a letter from Cynthia which Mr. Gibson had brought from
London; for every opportunity of private conveyance was seized upon
when postage was so high; and Cynthia had forgotten so many things in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hurried packing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) now sent a list of the clothes which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) required. Molly almost wondered that it had not come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>);
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not understand the sort of reserve that was springing
up in Cynthia's mind towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Cynthia herself struggled with
the feeling, and tried to fight against it by calling herself
<div class="bookquote">``ungrateful;''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>but the truth was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) no longer held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) former high place in Molly's estimation and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not help
turning away from one who knew things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) discredit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was fully
aware of Molly's prompt decision and willing action, where action
was especially disagreeable, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) behalf; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew that Molly
would never bring up the past errors and difficulties; but still the
consciousness that the good, straightforward girl had learnt that
Cynthia had been guilty of so much underhand work cooled her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) regard,
and restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) willingness of intercourse. Reproach herself with
ingratitude as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could not help feeling glad to be
away from Molly; it was awkward to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as if nothing had
happened; it was awkward to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) about forgotten ribbons
and laces, when their last conversation had been on such different
subjects, and had called out such vehement expressions of feeling.
So Mrs. Gibson held the list in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand, and read out the small
fragments of news that were intermixed with notices of Cynthia's
requirements.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen cannot be so very ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly at length, <div class="bookquote">``or Cynthia
would not want her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) pink muslin and daisy wreath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that that follows, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Gibson rather
sharply. <div class="bookquote">``Helen would never be so selfish as to tie Cynthia to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
side, however ill she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was. Indeed, I should not have felt that it
was my duty to let Cynthia go to London at all, if I had thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was to be perpetually exposed to the depressing atmosphere of
a sick-room. Besides, it must be so good for Helen to have Cynthia
coming in with bright pleasant accounts of the parties she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has been
to--even if Cynthia disliked gaiety I should desire her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to sacrifice
herself and go out as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could, for Helen's sake. My idea
of nursing is that one should not be always thinking of one's own
feelings and wishes, but doing those things which will most serve to
beguile the weary hours of an invalid. But then so few people have
had to consider the subject so deeply as I have done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson here thought fit to sigh before going on with Cynthia's
letter. As far as Molly could make any sense out of this rather
incoherent epistle, very incoherently read aloud to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), Cynthia was
really pleased, and glad to be of use and comfort to Helen, but at
the same time very ready to be easily persuaded into the perpetual
small gaieties which abounded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) uncle's house in London, even at
this dead season of the year. Mrs. Gibson came upon Mr. Henderson's
name once, and then went on with a running <div class="bookquote">``um-um-um''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henderson/Henderson</b></font>)</div>to herself,
which sounded very mysterious, but which might as well have been
omitted, as all that Cynthia really said about him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was, <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Henderson's mother has advised my aunt to consult a certain Dr.
Donaldson, who is said to be very clever in such cases as Helen's,
but my uncle is not sufficiently sure of the professional etiquette,
&c.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then there came a very affectionate, carefully worded message to
Molly,--implying a good deal more than was said of loving gratitude
for the trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had taken on Cynthia's behalf. And that was all;
and Molly went away a little depressed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew not why.

<p/>The operation on Lady Cumnor had been successfully performed, and in
a few days they hoped to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) down to the Towers to recruit her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
strength in the fresh country air. The case was one which interested
Mr. Gibson extremely, and in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) opinion had been proved to
be right, in opposition to that of one or two great names in London.
The consequence was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was frequently consulted and referred to
during the progress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) recovery; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had much to do in the
immediate circle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) Hollingford practice, as well as to write
thoughtful letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) medical brethren in London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) found it
difficult to spare the three or four hours necessary to go over to
Hamley to see Osborne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), however, begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to reply
immediately and detail his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) symptoms; and from the answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) received
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not imagine that the case was immediately pressing. Osborne,
too, deprecated his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) coming over to Hamley for the express purpose
of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). So the visit was deferred to that <div class="bookquote">``more convenient
season''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which is so often too late.

<p/>All these days the buzzing gossip about Molly's meetings with Mr.
Preston, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) clandestine correspondence, the secret interviews in
lonely places, had been gathering strength, and assuming the positive
form of scandal. The simple innocent girl, who walked through the
quiet streets without a thought of being the object of mysterious
implications, became for a time the unconscious black sheep of the
town. Servants heard part of what was said in their mistresses'
drawing-rooms, and exaggerated the sayings amongst themselves with
the coarse strengthening of expression common with uneducated people.
Mr. Preston himself became aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name was being coupled with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), though hardly to the extent to which the love of excitement and
gossip had carried people's speeches; he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) chuckled over the mistake,
but took no pains to correct it. <div class="bookquote">``It serves her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``for meddling with other folk's business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) felt
himself avenged for the discomfiture which her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) menace of appealing to
Lady Harriet had caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), and the mortification he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had experienced
in learning from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) plain-speaking lips, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had been talked
over by Cynthia and herself, with personal dislike on the one side,
and evident contempt on the other. Besides, if any denial of Mr.
Preston's stirred up an examination as to the real truth, more might
come out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) baffled endeavours to compel Cynthia to keep to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
engagement to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) cared to have known. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was angry with
himself for still loving Cynthia; loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) own fashion, be
it understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) told himself that many a woman of more position and
wealth would be glad enough to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); some of them pretty women
too. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) asked himself why he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was such a confounded fool as to go
on hankering after a penniless girl, who was as fickle as the wind?
The answer was silly enough, logically; but forcible in fact. Cynthia
was Cynthia, and not Venus herself could have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) substitute.
In this one thing Mr. Preston was more really true than many worthy
men; who, seeking to be married, turn with careless facility from the
unattainable to the attainable, and keep their feelings and fancy
tolerably loose till they find a woman who consents to be their wife.
But no one would ever be to Mr. Preston what Cynthia had been, and
was; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) could have stabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) in certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) moods. So,
Molly, who had come between him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) and the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) desire, was not
likely to find favour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) sight, or to obtain friendly actions
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>).

<p/>There came a time--not very distant from the evening at Mrs.
Dawes'--when Molly felt that people looked askance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Mrs.
Goodenough openly pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) grand-daughter away, when the young girl
stopped to speak to Molly in the street, and an engagement which
the two had made for a long walk together was cut very short by a
very trumpery excuse. Mrs. Goodenough explained her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) conduct in the
following manner to some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) friends:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, I don't think the worse of a girl for meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
sweetheart here and there and everywhere, till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gets talked about;
but then when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does--and Molly Gibson's name is in everybody's
mouth--I think it's only fair to Bessy, who has trusted me with
Annabella--not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daughter be seen with a lass who has
managed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) matters so badly as to set folk talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). My
maxim is this,--and it's a very good working one, you may depend
on't--women should mind what they're about, and never be talked of;
and if a woman's talked of, the less her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends have to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
till the talk has died away, the better. So Annabella is not to have
anything to do with Molly Gibson, this visit at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/>For a good while the Miss Brownings were kept in ignorance of the
evil tongues that whispered hard words about Molly. Miss Browning
was known to <div class="bookquote">``have a temper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>and by instinct every one who came in
contact with her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) shrank from irritating that temper by uttering the
slightest syllable against the smallest of those creatures over whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) spread the ægis of her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) would and did reproach them
herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) used to boast that she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) never spared them: but no one
else might touch them with the slightest slur of a passing word. But
Miss Phoebe inspired no such terror; the great reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) did
not hear of the gossip against Molly as early as any one, was that,
although she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was not the rose, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lived near the rose. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was of so tender a nature that even thick-skinned Mrs. Goodenough was
unwilling to say what would give Miss Phoebe pain; and it was the
new-comer Mrs. Dawes, who in all ignorance alluded to the town's
talk, as to something of which Miss Phoebe must be aware. Then Miss
Phoebe poured down her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) questions, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) protested, even with
tears, her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) total disbelief in all the answers she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) received. It was
a small act of heroism on her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) part to keep all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) then learnt
a secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister Dorothy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) did for four or five days;
till Miss Browning attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) one evening with the following
speech:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoebe! either you've some reason for puffing yourself out with
sighs, or you've not. If you have a reason, it's your duty to tell it
me directly; and if you haven't a reason, you must break yourself of
a bad habit that is growing upon you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sister! do you think it is really my duty to tell you? it would
be such a comfort; but then I thought I ought not; it will distress
you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense. I am so well prepared for misfortune by the frequent
contemplation of its possibility that I believe I can receive any ill
news with apparent equanimity and real resignation. Besides, when you
said yesterday at breakfast-time that you meant to give up the day
to making your drawers tidy, I was aware that some misfortune was
impending, though of course I could not judge of its magnitude. Is
the Highchester Bank broken?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, sister!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Phoebe, moving to a seat close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>)
sister's on the sofa. <div class="bookquote">``Have you really been thinking that! I wish I
had told you what I heard at the very first, if you've been fancying
that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take warning, Phoebe, and learn to have no concealments from me. I
did think we must be ruined, from your ways of going on: eating no
meat at dinner, and sighing continually. And now what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know how to tell you, Dorothy. I really don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Phoebe began to cry; Miss Browning took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) arm, and
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) a little sharp shake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cry as much as you like when you've told me; but don't cry now,
child, when you're keeping me on the tenter-hooks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly Gibson has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) character, sister. That's it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly Gibson has done no such thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning
indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``How dare you repeat such stories about poor Mary's
child? Never let me hear you say such things again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it. Mrs. Dawes told me; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) says it's all over the
town. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) I did not believe a word of it. And I kept it from
you; and I think I should have been really ill if I'd kept it to
myself any longer. Oh, sister! what are you going to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>For Miss Browning had risen without speaking a word, and was leaving
the room in a stately and determined fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to put on my bonnet and things, and then I shall call upon
Mrs. Dawes, and confront her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't call them lies, sister; it's such a strong, ugly word.
Please call them tallydiddles, for I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) meant any
harm. Besides--besides--if they should turn out to be truth? Really,
sister, that's the weight on my mind; so many things sounded as if
they might be true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, still standing with judicial
erectness of position in the middle of the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--one story was that Molly had given him (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's him (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)? How am I to understand a story told in that silly way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>Miss Browning sat down on the nearest chair, and made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) mind to
be patient if she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is Mr. Preston. And that must be true; because I missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
from my side when I wanted to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought blue would look
green by candlelight, as the young man said it would, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had run
across the street, and Mrs. Goodenough was just going into the shop,
just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Browning's distress was overcoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) anger; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) only said,
<div class="bookquote">``Phoebe, I think you'll drive me mad. Do tell me what you heard
from Mrs. Dawes in a sensible and coherent manner, for once in your
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I'm trying with all my might to tell you everything just as
it happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you hear from Mrs. Dawes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that Molly and Mr. Preston were keeping company just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was a maid-servant and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was a gardener: meeting at all sorts of
improper times and places, and fainting away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) arms, and out at
night together, and writing to each other, and slipping their letters
into each other's hands; and that was what I was talking about,
sister, for I next door to saw that done once. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with my own
eyes run across the street to Grinstead's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grinstead</b></font>) was, for we had
just left him (<font color='blue'><b>Grinstead</b></font>) there; with a letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand, too, which was not
there when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) came back all fluttered and blushing. But I never
thought anything of it at the time; but now all the town is talking
about it, and crying shame, and saying they ought to be married.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>Miss Phoebe sank into sobbing again; but was suddenly roused by a
good box on her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) ear. Miss Browning was standing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) almost
trembling with passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoebe, if ever I hear you say such things again, I'll turn you
out of the house that minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only said what Mrs. Dawes said, and you asked me what it was,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Phoebe, humbly and meekly. <div class="bookquote">``Dorothy, you should not
have done that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind whether I should or I shouldn't. That's not the matter
in hand. What I've got to decide is, how to put a stop to all these
lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Dorothy, they are not all lies--if you will call them so; I'm
afraid some things are true; though I stuck to their being false when
Mrs. Dawes told me of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I go to Mrs. Dawes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) repeats them to me, I shall slap her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)
face or box her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) ears I'm afraid, for I couldn't stand tales being
told of poor Mary's daughter, as if they were just a stirring piece
of news like James Horrocks' pig with two heads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning,
meditating aloud. <div class="bookquote">``That would do harm instead of good. Phoebe, I'm
really sorry I boxed your ears, only I should do it again if you said
the same things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>Phoebe sate down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister, and took hold of
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) withered hands, and began caressing it, which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) way
of accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister's expression of regret. <div class="bookquote">``If I speak to Molly,
the child will deny it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s half as good-for-nothing as they
say; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'ll only worry herself to death. No, that
won't do. Mrs. Goodenough--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>)'s a donkey; and if I convinced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) could never convince any one else. No; Mrs. Dawes, who told
you, shall tell me, and I'll tie my hands together inside my muff,
and bind myself over to keep the peace. And when I've heard what is
to be heard, I'll put the matter into Mr. Gibson's hands. That's what
I'll do. So it's no use your saying anything against it, Phoebe,
for I shan't attend to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Browning went to Mrs. Dawes' and began civilly enough to make
inquiries concerning the reports current in Hollingford about Molly
and Mr. Preston; and Mrs. Dawes fell into the snare, and told all the
real and fictitious circumstances of the story in circulation, quite
unaware of the storm that was gathering and ready to fall upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>)
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) stopped speaking. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had not the long habit of
reverence for Miss Browning which would have kept so many Hollingford
ladies from justifying themselves if she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) found fault. Mrs. Dawes
stood up for herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) own veracity, bringing out fresh
scandal, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) did not believe, but that many did; and
adducing so much evidence as to the truth of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) had said and
did believe, that Miss Browning was almost quelled, and sate silent
and miserable at the end of Mrs. Dawes' justification of herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) said at length, rising up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) chair as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) spoke,
<div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry I've lived till this day; it's a blow to me just as
if I had heard of such goings-on in my own flesh and blood. I suppose
I ought to apologize to you, Mrs. Dawes, for what I said; but I've
no heart to do it to-day. I ought not to have spoken as I did; but
that's nothing to this affair, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you do me the justice to perceive that I only repeated what
I had heard on good authority, Miss Browning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dawes in
reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, don't repeat evil on any authority unless you can do some
good by speaking about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) hand on
Mrs. Dawes' shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not a good woman, but I know what is good,
and that advice is. And now I think I can tell you that I beg your
pardon for flying out upon you so; but God knows what pain you were
putting me to. You'll forgive me, won't you, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawes</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dawes
felt the hand trembling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawes</b></font>) shoulder, and saw the real distress of
Miss Browning's mind, so it was not difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) to grant the
requested forgiveness. Then Miss Browning went home, and said but a
few words to Phoebe, who indeed saw well enough that her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) sister had
heard the reports confirmed, and needed no further explanation of
the cause of scarcely-tasted dinner, and short replies, and saddened
looks. Presently Miss Browning sate down and wrote a short note. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) rang the bell, and told the little maiden who answered it to
take it to Mr. Gibson, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was out to see that it was given
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came home. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) went and put on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) Sunday cap; and Miss Phoebe knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sister had written
to ask Mr. Gibson to come and be told of the rumours affecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
daughter. Miss Browning was sadly disturbed at the information she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)
had received, and the task that lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) was miserably
uncomfortable to herself and irritable to Miss Phoebe, and the
netting-cotton she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was using kept continually snapping and breaking
from the jerks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) nervous hands. When the knock at the door was
heard,--the well-known doctor's knock,--Miss Browning took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)
spectacles, and dropped them on the carpet, breaking them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)
did so; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) bade Miss Phoebe leave the room, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>)
presence had cast the evil-eye, and caused the misfortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) wanted
to look natural, and was distressed at forgetting whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) usually
received him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sitting or standing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), coming in cheerfully, and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cold hands as
he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went straight to the fire, <div class="bookquote">``and what is the matter with us? It's
Phoebe, I suppose? I hope none of those old spasms? But, after all,
a dose or two will set that to rights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Gibson, I wish it was Phoebe, or me either!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning, trembling more and more.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sate down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) patiently, when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) agitation, and took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) hand in a kind, friendly manner.

laughed out, <div class="bookquote">``What have I said about horsewhipping or poisoning?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went on, without noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>), talking to himself,--<div class="bookquote">``I've a great

quarter-deck march. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stopped close to Miss Browning's
chair: <div class="bookquote">``I'm thoroughly ungrateful to you, for as true a mark of

had taken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) effusion of gratitude.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I shall always love Molly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mother's

Browning. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) father did not understand it as such.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has done nothing to disgrace

scruple much at going on in falsehood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>was Miss Browning's remark on

to make it until he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was well out of hearing.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII.

<p/>AN INNOCENT CULPRIT.


<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head bent down--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) were facing some keen-blowing
wind--and yet there was not a breath of air stirring--Mr. Gibson
went swiftly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rang at the door-bell; an unusual
proceeding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) part. Maria opened the door. <div class="bookquote">``Go and tell Miss
Molly she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s wanted in the dining-room. Don't say who it is that wants
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>There was something in Mr. Gibson's manner that made Maria obey
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to the letter, in spite of Molly's surprised question,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wants me? Who is it, Maria?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson went into the dining-room, and shut the door, for an
instant's solitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went up to the chimney-piece, took hold of it,
and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hands, and tried to still the beating of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
heart.

<p/>The door opened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew that Molly stood there before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
tone of astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), turning round sharply. <div class="bookquote">``Shut the door. Come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), wondering what was amiss. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thoughts went to the
Hamleys immediately. <div class="bookquote">``Is it Osborne?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) asked, breathless. If Mr.
Gibson had not been too much agitated to judge calmly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might have
deduced comfort from these three words.

<p/>But instead of allowing himself to seek for comfort from collateral
evidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``Molly, what is this I hear? That you have been
keeping up a clandestine intercourse with Mr. Preston--meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
in out-of-the-way places; exchanging letters with him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) in a stealthy
way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had professed to disbelieve all this, and did disbelieve it
at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) soul, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) voice was hard and stern, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face was
white and grim, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes fixed Molly's with the terrible keenness
of their research. Molly trembled all over, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not attempt
to evade his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) penetration. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was silent for a moment, it was
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was rapidly reviewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) relation with regard to Cynthia
in the matter. It was but a moment's pause of silence; but it seemed
long minutes to one who was craving for a burst of indignant denial.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had taken hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) two arms just above her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wrists, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
advanced towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was unconscious of this action; but, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
impatience for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) words grew upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) grasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) more and more
tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) vice-like hands, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made a little involuntary
sound of pain. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) let go; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) soft bruised
flesh, with tears gathering fast to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father, should have hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) so. At the instant it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
stranger that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) should inflict bodily pain upon his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) child, than that
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) should have heard the truth--even in an exaggerated form. With a
childish gesture she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arm to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>); but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) expected
pity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) received none.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) just glanced at the mark, <div class="bookquote">``that is
nothing--nothing. Answer my question. Have you--have you met that man
in private?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa, I have; but I don't think it was wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sate down now. <div class="bookquote">``Wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) echoed, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Not wrong? Well! I
must bear it somehow. Your mother is dead. That's one comfort. It is
true, then, is it? Why, I didn't believe it--not I. I laughed in my
sleeve at their credulity; and I was the dupe all the time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I cannot tell you all. It is not my secret, or you should
know it directly. Indeed, you will be sorry some time--I have never
deceived you yet, have I?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>trying to take one of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hands; but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
kept them tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pockets, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes fixed on the pattern of
the carpet before him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), pleading again, <div class="bookquote">``have I ever
deceived you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I tell? I hear of this from the town's talk. I don't know
what next may come out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The town's talk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly in dismay. <div class="bookquote">``What business is it of
theirs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one makes it their business to cast dirt on a girl's name who
has disregarded the commonest rules of modesty and propriety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, you are very hard. Modesty disregarded! I will tell you
exactly what I have done. I met Mr. Preston once,--that evening
when you put me down to walk over Croston Heath,--and there was
another person with him (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>). I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) a second time--and that time by
appointment--nobody but our two selves,--in the Towers' Park. That is
all, papa. You must trust me. I cannot explain more. You must trust
me indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could not help relenting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) words; there was such truth in the
tone in which they were spoken. But he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) neither spoke nor stirred for
a minute or two. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes to hers for the first time
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had acknowledged the external truth of what he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) charged her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
with. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face was very white, but it bore the impress of the final
sincerity of death, when the true expression prevails without the
poor disguises of time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The letters?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said,--but almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) were ashamed to question
that countenance any further.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) one letter,--of which I did not write a word,--which, in
fact, I believe to have been merely an envelope, without any writing
whatever inside. The giving that letter,--the two interviews I have
named,--make all the private intercourse I have had with Mr. Preston.
Oh! papa, what have they been saying that has grieved--shocked you so
much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind. As the world goes, what you say you have done, Molly, is
ground enough. You must tell me all. I must be able to refute these
rumours point by point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How are they to be refuted, when you say that the truth which I have
acknowledged is ground enough for what people are saying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say you were not acting for yourself, but for another. If you
tell me who the other was,--if you tell me everything out fully,
I will do my utmost to screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)--for of course I guess it was
Cynthia--while I am exonerating you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, after some little consideration; <div class="bookquote">``I have told
you all I can tell; all that concerns myself; and I have promised not
to say one word more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then your character will be impugned. It must be, unless the fullest
explanation of these secret meetings is given. I've a great mind to
force the whole truth out of Preston himself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa! once again I beg you to trust me. If you ask Mr. Preston you
will very likely hear the whole truth; but that is just what I have
been trying so hard to conceal, for it will only make several people
very unhappy if it is known, and the whole affair is over and done
with now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not your share in it. Miss Browning sent for me this evening to
tell me how people were talking about you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) implied that it was a
complete loss of your good name. You don't know, Molly, how slight
a thing may blacken a girl's reputation for life. I'd hard work to
stand all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, even though I didn't believe a word of it at the
time. And now you've told me that much of it is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I think you are a brave man, papa. And you believe me, don't
you? We shall outlive these rumours, never fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know the power of ill-natured tongues, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, now you've called me `child' again I don't care for anything.
Dear, dear papa, I'm sure it is best and wisest to take no notice of
these speeches. After all, they may not mean them ill-naturedly. I am
sure Miss Browning would not. By-and-by they'll quite forget how much
they made out of so little,--and even if they don't, you would not
have me break my solemn word, would you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. But I cannot easily forgive the person who, by
practising on your generosity, led you into this scrape. You are very
young, and look upon these things as merely temporary evils. I have
more experience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, I don't see what I can do now, papa. Perhaps I've been
foolish; but what I did, I did of my own self. It was not suggested
to me. And I'm sure it was not wrong in morals, whatever it might
be in judgment. As I said, it's all over now; what I did ended the
affair, I am thankful to say; and it was with that object I did it.
If people choose to talk about me, I must submit; and so must you,
dear papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does your mother--does Mrs. Gibson--know anything about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) with sudden anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not a bit; not a word. Pray don't name it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). That might
lead to more mischief than anything else. I have really told you
everything I am at liberty to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a great relief to Mr. Gibson to find that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sudden fear that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife might have been privy to it all was ill-founded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been
seized by a sudden dread that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had chosen to marry in
order to have a protectress and guide for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter, had been
cognizant of this ill-advised adventure with Mr. Preston; nay, more,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might even have instigated it to save her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own child; for
that Cynthia was, somehow or other, at the bottom of it all he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had
no doubt whatever. But now, at any rate, Mrs. Gibson had not been
playing a treacherous part; that was all the comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) could extract
out of Molly's mysterious admission, that much mischief might result
from Mrs. Gibson's knowing anything about these meetings with Mr.
Preston.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, what is to be done?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``These reports are abroad,--am
I to do nothing to contradict them? Am I to go about smiling and
content with all this talk about you, passing from one idle gossip to
another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid so. I'm very sorry, for I never meant you to have known
anything about it, and I can see now how it must distress you. But
surely when nothing more happens, and nothing comes of what has
happened, the wonder and the gossip must die away. I know you believe
every word I have said, and that you trust me, papa. Please, for my
sake, be patient with all this gossip and cackle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will try me hard, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my sake, papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what else I can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) moodily, <div class="bookquote">``unless I get
hold of Preston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be the worst of all. That would make a talk. And, after
all, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was not so very much to blame. Yes! he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) behaved well to me as far as that goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), suddenly
recollecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) speech when Mr. Sheepshanks came up in the Towers'
Park--<div class="bookquote">``Don't stir, you have done nothing to be ashamed of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sheepshanks/Sheepshanks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. A quarrel between men which drags a woman's name into

it out with Preston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) shall find it not so pleasant to have placed
my daughter in equivocal circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) didn't place me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) didn't know I was coming, didn't expect to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay; what else, indeed? How shall you bear it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant the quick hot tears sprang into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes; to have
everybody--all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) world, thinking evil of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), did seem hard to the
girl who had never thought or said an unkind thing of them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) made answer,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like tooth-drawing, it will be over some time. It would be much
worse if I really had been doing wrong.''

mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, Cynthia must not be accused, or suspected; you will drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
out of your house if you do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is so proud, and so unprotected,

which won't be over yet awhile, I can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>For all Molly's bravery at the time of this conversation, it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
that suffered more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kept out of the way of hearing
gossip; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was perpetually thrown into the small society of the
place. Mrs. Gibson herself had caught cold, and moreover was not
tempted by the quiet old-fashioned visiting which was going on just
about this time, provoked by the visit of two of Mrs. Dawes' pretty
unrefined nieces, who laughed, and chattered, and ate, and would fain
have flirted with Mr. Ashton, the vicar, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) have been brought
by any possibility to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) share in the business. Mr.
Preston did not accept the invitations to Hollingford tea-drinkings
with the same eager gratitude as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had done a year before: or else
the shadow which hung over Molly would have extended to him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
co-partner in the clandestine meetings which gave such umbrage to
the feminine virtue of the town. Molly herself was invited, because
it would not do to pass any apparent slight on either Mr. or Mrs.
Gibson; but there was a tacit and underhand protest against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) being
received on the old terms. Every one was civil to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), but no one was
cordial; there was a very perceptible film of difference in their
behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) from what it was formerly; nothing that had outlines
and could be defined. But Molly, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) clear conscience and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
brave heart, felt acutely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was only tolerated, not welcomed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) caught the buzzing whispers of the two Miss Oakes's, who, when
they first met the heroine of the prevailing scandal, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
askance, and criticised her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) pretensions to good looks, with hardly
an attempt at under-tones. Molly tried to be thankful that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father was not in the mood for visiting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was even glad that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
stepmother was too much of an invalid to come out, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt thus
slighted, and as it were, degraded from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) place. Miss Browning
herself, that true old friend, spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) with chilling dignity,
and much reserve; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) had never heard a word from Mr. Gibson
since the evening when she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) had put herself to so much pain to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of the disagreeable rumours affecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter.

<p/>Only Miss Phoebe would seek out Molly with even more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
former tenderness; and this tried Molly's calmness more than all
the slights put together. The soft hand, pressing hers under the
table,--the continual appeals to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), so as to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) back into
the conversation, touched Molly almost to shedding tears. Sometimes
the poor girl wondered to herself whether this change in the
behaviour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) acquaintances was not a mere fancy of hers; whether,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had never had that conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had borne herself so bravely at the time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should have discovered
the difference in their treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt these perpetual small slights: she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had chosen to bear
the burden of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own free will; nay, more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had insisted on
being allowed to do so; and it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to grieve him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now by
showing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shrank from the consequences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own act. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
never even made an excuse for not going into the small gaieties, or
mingling with the society of Hollingford. Only she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) suddenly let go
the stretch of restraint she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was living in, when one evening her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was really anxious about Mrs. Gibson's cough,
and should like Molly to give up a party at Mrs. Goodenough's, to
which they were all three invited, but to which Molly alone was
going. Molly's heart leaped up at the thought of stopping at home,
even though the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had to blame herself for rejoicing at
a reprieve that was purchased by another's suffering. However, the
remedies prescribed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband did Mrs. Gibson good; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
particularly grateful and caressing to Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), stroking Molly's head, <div class="bookquote">``I think your hair
is getting softer, and losing that disagreeable crisp curly feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Molly knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother was in high good-humour; the
smoothness or curliness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hair was a sure test of the favour in
which Mrs. Gibson held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) at the moment.

<p/>``I am so sorry to be the cause of detaining you from this little
party, but dear papa is so over-anxious about me. I have always been
a kind of pet with gentlemen, and poor Mr. Kirkpatrick never knew how
to make enough of me. But I think Mr. Gibson is even more foolishly
fond: his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) last words were, ``Take care of yourself, Hyacinth;' and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came back again to say, <div class="bookquote">``If you don't attend to my directions
I won't answer for the consequences.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I shook my forefinger at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't be so anxious, you silly man.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we have done everything he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told us to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! I feel so much better. Do you know, late as it is, I think
you might go to Mrs. Goodenough's yet? Maria could take you, and I
should like to see you dressed; when one has been wearing dull warm
gowns for a week or two one gets quite a craving for bright colours,
and evening dress. So go and get ready, dear, and then perhaps you'll
bring me back some news, for really, shut up as I have been with only
papa and you for the last fortnight, I've got quite moped and dismal,
and I can't bear to keep young people from the gaieties suitable to
their age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pray, mamma! I had so much rather not go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well! very well! Only I think it is rather selfish of you, when
you see I am so willing to make the sacrifice for your sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you say it is a sacrifice to you, and I don't want to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; did I not say you might stop at home? only pray don't
chop logic; nothing is so fatiguing to a sick person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they were silent for some time. Mrs. Gibson broke the silence by
saying, in a languid voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you think of anything amusing to say, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly pumped up from the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind a few little trivialities
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had nearly forgotten, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt that they were anything
but amusing, and so Mrs. Gibson seemed to feel them; for presently
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Cynthia was at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And Molly felt it as a reproach to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
own dulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm not sure; I wish I knew a great many things. You've not
heard anything of poor dear Osborne Hamley lately, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's charge not to speak of Osborne's health,
Molly made no reply, nor was any needed, for Mrs. Gibson went on
thinking aloud--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, if Mr. Henderson has been as attentive as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was in the
spring--and the chances about Roger--I shall be really grieved if
anything happens to that young man, uncouth as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, but it must be
owned that Africa is not merely an unhealthy--it is a savage--and
even in some parts a cannibal country. I often think of all I've
read of it in geography books, as I lie awake at night, and if Mr.
Henderson is really becoming attached! The future is hidden from us
by infinite wisdom, Molly, or else I should like to know it; one
would calculate one's behaviour at the present time so much better if
one only knew what events were to come. But I think, on the whole, we
had better not alarm Cynthia. If we had only known in time we might
have planned for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to have come down with Lord Cumnor and my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they coming? Is Lady Cumnor well enough to travel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure; or else I should not have considered whether or no
Cynthia could have come down with them. It would have sounded very
well--more than respectable, and would have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) a position
among that lawyer set in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Lady Cumnor is better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. I should have thought papa would have mentioned it to
you; but, to be sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is always so scrupulously careful not to
speak about his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) patients. Quite right too--quite right and delicate.
Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) hardly ever tells me how they are going on. Yes! the Earl and
the Countess, and Lady Harriet and Lord and Lady Cuxhaven, and Lady
Agnes; and I've ordered a new winter bonnet and a black satin cloak.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLIX.

<p/>MOLLY GIBSON FINDS A CHAMPION.


<p/>Lady Cumnor had so far recovered from the violence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) attack, and
from the consequent operation, as to be able to be removed to the
Towers for change of air; and accordingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was brought thither
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) whole family with all the pomp and state becoming an invalid
peeress. There was every probability that <div class="bookquote">``the family''  (<font color='red'><b>time wanderers</b></font>)</div>would make a
longer residence at the Towers than they had done for several years,
during which time they had been wanderers hither and thither in
search of health. Somehow, after all, it was very pleasant and
restful to come to the old ancestral home, and every member of the
family enjoyed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own way; Lord Cumnor most especially.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) talent for gossip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) love of small details had scarcely
fair play in the hurry of a London life, and were much nipped in the
bud during his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) Continental sojournings, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) neither spoke French
fluently, nor understood it easily when spoken. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was a
great proprietor, and liked to know how his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) land was going on; how
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) tenants were faring in the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) liked to hear of their
births, marriages, and deaths, and had something of a royal memory
for faces. In short, if ever a peer was an old woman, Lord Cumnor
was that peer; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was a very good-natured old woman, and rode
about on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) stout old cob with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) pockets full of halfpence for
the children, and little packets of snuff for the old people. Like
an old woman, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) enjoyed an afternoon cup of tea in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) wife's
sitting-room, and over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) gossip's beverage he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) would repeat all that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had learnt in the day. Lady Cumnor was exactly in that state of
convalescence when such talk as her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) lord's was extremely agreeable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had contemned the habit of listening to gossip so
severely all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) life, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) thought it due to consistency to
listen first, and enter a supercilious protest afterwards. It had,
however, come to be a family habit for all of them to gather together
in Lady Cumnor's room on their return from their daily walks, or
drives, or rides, and over the fire, sipping their tea at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) early
meal, to recount the morsels of local intelligence they had heard
during the morning. When they had said all that they had to say -LRB-and
not before-RRB-, they had always to listen to a short homily from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
ladyship on the well-worn texts,--the poorness of conversation about
persons,--the probable falsehood of all they had heard, and the
degradation of character implied by its repetition. On one of these
November evenings they were all assembled in Lady Cumnor's room.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was lying,--all draped in white, and covered up with an Indian
shawl,--on a sofa near the fire. Lady Harriet sate on the rug, close
before the wood-fire, picking up fallen embers with a pair of dwarf
tongs, and piling them on the red and odorous heap in the centre of
the hearth. Lady Cuxhaven, notable from girlhood, was using the blind
man's holiday to net fruit-nets for the walls at Cuxhaven Park. Lady
Cumnor's woman was trying to see to pour out tea by the light of one
small wax-candle in the background -LRB-for Lady Cumnor could not bear
much light to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) weakened eyes-RRB-; and the great leafless branches of
the trees outside the house kept sweeping against the windows, moved
by the wind that was gathering.

<p/>It was always Lady Cumnor's habit to snub those she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) loved best. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
husband was perpetually snubbed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) missed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was later than usual, and professed not to want her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) tea; but they
all knew that it was only because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not there to hand it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>),
and be found fault with for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) invariable stupidity in forgetting
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) liked to put sugar in before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) took any cream. At length
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) burst in:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, my lady,--I'm later than I should have been,
I know. Why! haven't you had your tea yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) exclaimed, bustling
about to get the cup for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I never take cream before I've sweetened it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
with even more emphasis on the <div class="bookquote">``never''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>than usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear! What a simpleton I am! I think I might have remembered it
by this time. You see I met old Sheepshanks, and that's the reason of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of your handing me the cream before the sugar?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. It
was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grim jokes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! ha, ha! You're better this evening, I think, my dear. But,
as I was saying, Sheepshanks is such an eternal talker, there's no
getting away from him (<font color='blue'><b>cream</b></font>), and I had no idea it was so late!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think the least you can do is to tell us something of Mr.
Sheepshanks' conversation now you have torn yourself away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Conversation! did I call it conversation? I don't think I said much.
I listened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) really has always a great deal to say. More than
Preston, for instance. And, by the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was telling me something
about Preston;--old Sheepshanks thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>)'ll be married before
long,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) says there's a great deal of gossip going on about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>)
and Gibson's daughter. They've been caught meeting in the park, and
corresponding, and all that kind of thing that is likely to end in a
marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet. <div class="bookquote">``I always liked that
girl; and I can't bear papa's model land-agent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay it's not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, in a very audible aside
to Lady Harriet. <div class="bookquote">``Papa picks up stories one day to contradict them
the next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but this did sound like truth. Sheepshanks said all the old
ladies in the town had got hold of it, and were making a great
scandal out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it does sound quite a nice story. I wonder what Clare
could be doing to allow such goings on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cuxhaven</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cuxhaven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is much more likely that Clare's own daughter--that
pretty pawky Miss Kirkpatrick--is the real heroine of this story,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) always looks like a heroine of genteel
comedy; and those young ladies were capable of a good deal of
innocent intriguing, if I remember rightly. Now little Molly Gibson
has a certain _gaucherie_ about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) which would disqualify her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) at
once from any clandestine proceedings. Besides, ``clandestine!<div class="bookquote">'' why,
the child is truth itself. Papa, are you sure Mr. Sheepshanks said it
was Miss Gibson that was exciting Hollingford scandal? Wasn't it Miss
Kirkpatrick? The notion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) and Mr. Preston making a match of it
doesn't sound so incongruous; but if it's my little friend Molly,
I'll go to church and forbid the banns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Harriet, I can't think what always makes you take such an
interest in all these petty Hollingford affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, it's only tit for tat. They take the most lively interest
in all our sayings and doings. If I were going to be married, they
would want to know every possible particular,--when we first met,
what we first said to each other, what I wore, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) offered
by letter or in person. I'm sure those good Miss Brownings were
wonderfully well-informed as to Mary's methods of managing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
nursery, and educating her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) girls; so it's only a proper return of the
compliment to want to know on our side how they are going on. I'm
quite of papa's faction. I like to hear all the local gossip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially when it is flavoured with a spice of scandal and
impropriety, as in this case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, with the momentary
bitterness of a convalescent invalid. Lady Harriet coloured with
annoyance. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) courage, and said with more
gravity than before,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am really interested in this story about Molly Gibson, I own. I
both like and respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); and I do not like to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) name coupled
with that of Mr. Preston. I can't help fancying papa has made some
mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear. I'm sure I'm repeating what I heard. I'm sorry I said
anything about it, if it annoys you or my lady there. Sheepshanks did
say Miss Gibson, though, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) went on to say it was a pity the girl
had got herself so talked about; for it was the way they had carried
on that gave rise to all the chatter. Preston himself was a very
fair match for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and nobody could have objected to it. But I'll
try and find a more agreeable piece of news. Old Margery at the
lodge is dead; and they don't know where to find some one to teach
clear-starching at your school; and Robert Hall made forty pounds
last year by his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) apples.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>So they drifted away from Molly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
affairs; only Lady Harriet kept turning what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had heard over in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own mind with interest and wonder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) the day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) father's wedding. And what
a straightforward, out-spoken topic it was then! I don't believe it;
it's only one of old Sheepshanks' stories, half invention and half
deafness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day Lady Harriet rode over to Hollingford, and for the
settling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) curiosity she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) called on Miss Brownings, and
introduced the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would not have spoken about the rumour
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had heard to any who were not warm friends of Molly's. If Mr.
Sheepshanks had chosen to allude to it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been riding with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would very soon have silenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheepshanks</b></font>) by one of the
haughty looks she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew full well how to assume. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must know the truth, and accordingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began thus abruptly to
Miss Browning:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is all this I hear about my little friend Molly Gibson and Mr.
Preston?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lady Harriet! have you heard of it? We are so sorry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, begging your ladyship's pardon, we had better not say any
more till we know how much you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>replied Lady Harriet, laughing a little, <div class="bookquote">``I shan't tell what I
know till I am sure you know more. Then we'll make an exchange if you
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it's no laughing matter for poor Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``People do say such things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't believe them; indeed I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>burst in Miss Phoebe,
half crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more will I, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, taking the good lady's
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very fine, Phoebe, saying you don't believe them, but I
should like to know who it was that convinced me, sadly against my
will, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only told you the facts as Mrs. Goodenough told them me, sister;
but I'm sure if you had seen poor patient Molly as I have done,
sitting up in a corner of a room, looking at the _Beauties of England
and Wales_ till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must have been sick of them, and no one speaking
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as gentle and sweet as ever at the end of the
evening, though maybe a bit pale--facts or no facts, I won't believe
anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>So there sate Miss Phoebe, in tearful defiance of facts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, as I said before, I'm quite of your opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Harriet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how does your ladyship explain away her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) meetings with Mr.
Preston in all sorts of unlikely and open-air places?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>asked Miss
Browning,--who, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) justice, would have been only too glad to
join Molly's partisans, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could have preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) character for
logical deduction at the same time. <div class="bookquote">``I went so far as to send for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) all about it. I thought at least he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have
horsewhipped Mr. Preston; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) seems to have taken no notice of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we may be quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) knows some way of explaining matters
that we don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, decisively. <div class="bookquote">``After all, there
may be a hundred and fifty perfectly natural and justifiable
explanations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gibson knew of none when I thought it my duty to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, suppose that Mr. Preston is engaged to Miss Kirkpatrick, and
Molly is confidante and messenger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that your ladyship's supposition much alters the blame.
Why, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) is honourably engaged to Cynthia Kirkpatrick, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) not
visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) openly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) home in Mr. Gibson's house? Why does Molly
lend herself to clandestine proceedings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can't account for everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, a little
impatiently, for reason was going hard against her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I choose to
have faith in Molly Gibson. I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s not done anything very
wrong. I've a great mind to go and call on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)--Mrs. Gibson is
confined to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) room with this horrid influenza--and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with
me on a round of calls through this little gossiping town,--on Mrs.
Goodenough, or Badenough, who seems to have been propagating all
these stories. But I've not time to-day. I've to meet papa at three,
and it's three now. Only remember, Miss Phoebe, it's you and I
against the world, in defence of a distressed damsel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote and Sancho Panza!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ran
lightly down Miss Browning's old-fashioned staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I don't think that's pretty of you, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Browning in some displeasure, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) was alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>)
sister. <div class="bookquote">``First, you convince me against my will, and make me very
unhappy; and I have to do unpleasant things, all because you've made
me believe that certain statements are true; and then you turn round
and cry, and say you don't believe a word of it all, making me out
a regular ogre and backbiter. No! it's of no use. I shan't listen
to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) left Miss Phoebe in tears, and locked herself up in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) own room.

<p/>Lady Harriet, meanwhile, was riding homewards by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's side,
apparently listening to all he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chose to say, but in reality turning
over the probabilities and possibilities that might account for these
strange interviews between Molly and Mr. Preston. It was a case of
_parler de l'âne et l'on en voit les oreilles_. At a turn in the road
they saw Mr. Preston a little way before them, coming towards them on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) good horse, _point device_, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) riding attire.

<p/>The earl, in his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) thread-bare coat, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) old brown cob, called
out cheerfully,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha! here's Preston. Good-day to you. I was just wanting to ask you
about that slip of pasture-land on the Home Farm. John Brickkill
wants to plough it up and crop it. It's not two acres at the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The earl</b></font>)</div><p/>While they were talking over this bit of land, Lady Harriet came to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) resolution. As soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father had finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Preston, perhaps you will allow me to ask you one or two questions to
relieve my mind, for I am in some little perplexity at present.''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: LADY HARRIET ASKS ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; I shall only be too happy to give you any information in
my power.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But the moment after he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had made this polite speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
recollected Molly's speech--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would refer her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) case to Lady
Harriet. But the letters had been returned, and the affair was now
wound up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had come off conqueror, he (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) the vanquished. Surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
would never have been so ungenerous as to appeal after that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are reports about Miss Gibson and you current among the
gossips of Hollingford. Are we to congratulate you on your engagement
to that young lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! by the way, Preston, we ought to have done it before,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Cumnor</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lord Cumnor, in hasty goodwill. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) daughter said
quietly, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Preston has not yet told us if the reports are well
founded, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) with the air of a person expecting an answer, and
expecting a truthful answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not so fortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), trying to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) horse appear
fidgety, without incurring observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I may contradict that report?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Harriet quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Or
is there any reason for believing that in time it may come true? I
ask because such reports, if unfounded, do harm to young ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep other sweethearts off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Cumnor</b></font>)</div>put in Lord Cumnor, looking a good deal
pleased at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own discernment. Lady Harriet went on:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I take a great interest in Miss Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Preston saw from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) manner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``in for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
expressed it to himself. The question was, how much or how little did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) know?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no expectation or hope of ever having a nearer interest
in Miss Gibson than I have at present. I shall be glad if this
straightforward answer relieves your ladyship from your perplexity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) could not help the touch of insolence that accompanied these last
words. It was not in the words themselves, nor in the tone in which
they were spoken, nor in the look which accompanied them, it was in
all; it implied a doubt of Lady Harriet's right to question him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did; and there was something of defiance in it as well. But this
touch of insolence put Lady Harriet's mettle up; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not one
to check herself, in any course, for the opinion of an inferior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, sir! are you aware of the injury you may do to a young lady's
reputation if you meet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and detain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in long conversations,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is walking by herself, unaccompanied by any one? You give
rise--you have given rise to reports.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Harriet, are not you going too far? You don't know--Mr.
Preston may have intentions--unacknowledged intentions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my lord. I have no intentions with regard to Miss Gibson. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
may be a very worthy young lady--I have no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is. Lady Harriet
seems determined to push me into such a position that I cannot
but acknowledge myself to be--it is not enviable--not pleasant to
own--but I am, in fact, a jilted man; jilted by Miss Kirkpatrick,
after a tolerably long engagement. My interviews with Miss Gibson
were not of the most agreeable kind--as you may conclude when I
tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was, I believe, the instigator--certainly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was the
agent in this last step of Miss Kirkpatrick's. Is your ladyship's
curiosity''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with an emphasis on this last word-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``satisfied with this
rather mortifying confession of mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet, my dear, you've gone too far--we had no right to pry into
Mr. Preston's private affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more I had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, with a smile of winning
frankness: the first smile she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had accorded to Mr. Preston for many
a long day; ever since the time, years ago, when, presuming on his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)
handsomeness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had assumed a tone of gallant familiarity with Lady
Harriet, and paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) personal compliments as he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) would have done to
an equal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) will excuse me, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), still in that
gracious manner which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) now held a much higher
place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) esteem than he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had had at the beginning of their
interview, <div class="bookquote">``when he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) learns that the busy tongues of the Hollingford
ladies have been speaking of my friend, Miss Gibson, in the most
unwarrantable manner; drawing unjustifiable inferences from the facts
of that intercourse with Mr. Preston, the nature of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) has just
conferred such a real obligation on me by explaining.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I need hardly request Lady Harriet to consider this
explanation of mine as confidential,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Preston/Preston/MR. PRESTON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Preston.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>the earl</b></font>)</div>said the earl; <div class="bookquote">``every one will understand
that.''  (<font color='red'><b>the earl</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) rode home, and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) wife and Lady Cuxhaven the
whole conversation between Lady Harriet and Mr. Preston; in the
strictest confidence, of course. Lady Harriet had to stand a good
many strictures on manners, and proper dignity for a few days after
this. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) consoled herself by calling on the Gibsons; and,
finding that Mrs. Gibson -LRB-who was still an invalid-RRB- was asleep at the
time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) experienced no difficulty in carrying off the unconscious
Molly for a walk, which Lady Harriet so contrived that they twice
passed through all the length of the principal street of the town,
loitered at Grinstead's for half an hour, and wound up by Lady
Harriet's calling on the Miss Brownings, who, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) regret, were not
at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, it's as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), after a minute's consideration.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll leave my card, and put your name down underneath it, Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was a little puzzled by the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been taken
possession of, like an inanimate chattel, for all the afternoon, and
exclaimed,--<div class="bookquote">``Please, Lady Harriet--I never leave cards; I have not
got any, and on the Miss Brownings, of all people; why, I am in and
out whenever I like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, little one. To-day you shall do everything properly, and
according to full etiquette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now tell Mrs. Gibson to come out to the Towers for a long day;
we will send the carriage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) will let us know that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is strong enough to come. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had better come for a few
days; at this time of the year it doesn't do for an invalid to be out
in the evenings, even in a carriage.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>So spoke Lady Harriet, standing
on the white door-steps at Miss Brownings', and holding Molly's hand
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) good-by. <div class="bookquote">``You'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), dear, that I came
partly to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)--but that finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) asleep, I ran off with you,
and don't forget about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) coming to stay with us for change of
air--mamma will like it, I'm sure--and the carriage, and all that.
And now good-by, we've done a good day's work! And better than you're
aware of,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), still addressing Molly, though the latter
was quite out of hearing. <div class="bookquote">``Hollingford is not the place I take it
to be, if it doesn't veer round in Miss Gibson's favour after my
to-day's trotting of that child about.''




 (<font color='red'><b>L.</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER L.

<p/>CYNTHIA AT BAY.


<p/>Mrs. Gibson was slow in recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) strength after the influenza,
and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was well enough to accept Lady Harriet's invitation to
the Towers, Cynthia came home from London. If Molly had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
manner of departure was scarcely as affectionate and considerate as
it might have been,--if such a thought had crossed Molly's fancy
for an instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was repentant for it as soon as ever Cynthia
returned, and the girls met together face to face, with all the old
familiar affection, going upstairs to the drawing-room, with their
arms round each other's waists, and sitting there together hand in
hand. Cynthia's whole manner was more quiet than it had been, when
the weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) unpleasant secret rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mind, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
alternately despondent or flighty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, <div class="bookquote">``there's a look of home about these rooms
which is very pleasant. But I wish I could see you looking stronger,
mamma! that's the only unpleasant thing. Molly, why didn't you send
for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>began Molly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I wouldn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``You were much better
in London than here, for you could have done me no good; and your
letters were very agreeable to read; and now Helen is better, and
I'm nearly well, and you've come home just at the right time, for
everybody is full of the Charity Ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we are not going this year, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia decidedly.
<div class="bookquote">``It's on the 25th, isn't it? and I'm sure you'll never be well enough
to take us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You really seem determined to make me out worse than I am, child,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, rather querulously, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) being one of those who,
when their malady is only trifling, exaggerate it, but when it is
really of some consequence, are unwilling to sacrifice any pleasures
by acknowledging it. It was well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in this instance that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
husband had wisdom and authority enough to forbid her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) going to
this ball, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart; but the consequence of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) prohibition was an increase of domestic plaintiveness and low
spirits, which seemed to tell on Cynthia--the bright gay Cynthia
herself--and it was often hard work for Molly to keep up the spirits
of two other people as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own. Ill-health might account for
Mrs. Gibson's despondency, but why was Cynthia so silent, not to say
so sighing? Molly was puzzled to account for it; and all the more
perplexed because from time to time Cynthia kept calling upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) for
praise for some unknown and mysterious virtue that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had practised;
and Molly was young enough to believe that, after any exercise of
virtue, the spirits rose, cheered up by an approving conscience.
Such was not the case with Cynthia, however. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sometimes said
such things as these, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had been particularly inert and
desponding:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Molly, you must let my goodness lie fallow for a while!
It has borne such a wonderful crop this year. I have been so
pretty-behaved--if you knew all!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Or, <div class="bookquote">``Really, Molly, my virtue
must come down from the clouds! It was strained to the utmost in
London--and I find it is like a kite--after soaring aloft for some
time, it suddenly comes down, and gets tangled in all sorts of
briars and brambles; which things are an allegory, unless you can
bring yourself to believe in my extraordinary goodness while I was
away--giving me a sort of right to fall foul of all mamma's briars
and brambles now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>But Molly had had some experience of Cynthia's whim of perpetually
hinting at a mystery which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not mean to reveal in the Mr.
Preston days, and, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was occasionally piqued into
curiosity, Cynthia's allusions at something more in the background
fell in general on rather deaf ears. One day the mystery burst its
shell, and came out in the shape of an offer made to Cynthia by Mr.
Henderson--and refused. Under all the circumstances, Molly could not
appreciate the heroic goodness so often alluded to. The revelation of
the secret at last took place in this way. Mrs. Gibson breakfasted
in bed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had done so ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had had the influenza;
and, consequently, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own private letters always went up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
breakfast-tray. One morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came into the drawing-room earlier
than usual, with an open letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had a letter from aunt Kirkpatrick, Cynthia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sends me my
dividends,--your uncle is so busy. But what does she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mean by this,
Cynthia?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>-LRB-holding out the letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), with a certain paragraph
indicated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) finger-RRB-. Cynthia put her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) netting on one side, and
looked at the writing. Suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) face turned scarlet, and then
became of a deadly white. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) looked at Molly, as if to gain courage
from the strong serene countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It means--mamma, I may as well tell you at once--Mr. Henderson
offered to me while I was in London, and I refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)--and you never told me, but let me hear it by chance!
Really, Cynthia, I think you're very unkind. And pray what made you
refuse Mr. Henderson? Such a fine young man,--and such a gentleman!
Your uncle told me he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had a very good private fortune besides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, do you forget that I have promised to marry Roger Hamley?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! of course I don't--how can I, with Molly always dinning the word
`engagement' into my ears? But really, when one considers all the
uncertainties,--and after all it was not a distinct promise,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
seemed almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) might have looked forward to something of this
sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what sort, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of a more eligible offer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) must have known you might change
your mind, and meet with some one you liked better: so little as you
had seen of the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia made an impatient movement, as if to
stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) better,--how can you talk so, mamma? I'm
going to marry Roger, and there's an end of it. I will not be spoken
to about it again.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) got up and left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to marry Roger! That's all very fine. But who is to guarantee
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) coming back alive? And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) does, what have they to marry
upon, I should like to know? I don't wish her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to have accepted Mr.
Henderson, though I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>); and true love ought to
have its course, and not be thwarted; but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) need not have quite
finally refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) until--well, until we had seen how matters turn
out. Such an invalid as I am too! It has given me quite a palpitation
at the heart. I do call it quite unfeeling of Cynthia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,--''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>began Molly; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) remembered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
stepmother was far from strong, and unable to bear a protest in
favour of the right course without irritation. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
speech into a suggestion of remedies for palpitation; and curbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
impatience to speak out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) indignation at the contemplated falsehood
to Roger. But when they were alone, and Cynthia began upon the
subject, Molly was less merciful. Cynthia said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Molly, and now you know all! I've been longing to tell
you--and yet somehow I could not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it was a repetition of Mr. Coxe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, gravely.
<div class="bookquote">``You were agreeable,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) took it for something more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>sighed Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``I mean I don't know if I was
agreeable or not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coxe</b></font>) was very kind--very pleasant--but I did not
expect it all to end as it did. However, it's of no use thinking of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, simply; for to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mind the pleasantest and kindest
person in the world put in comparison with Roger was as nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
stood by himself. Cynthia's next words,--and they did not come very
soon,--were on quite a different subject, and spoken in rather a
pettish tone. Nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) allude again in jesting sadness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) late
efforts at virtue.

<p/>In a little while Mrs. Gibson was able to accept the often-repeated
invitation from the Towers to go and stay there for a day or two.
Lady Harriet told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that it would be a kindness to Lady Cumnor to
come and bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) company in the life of seclusion the latter was
still compelled to lead; and Mrs. Gibson was flattered and gratified
with a dim unconscious sense of being really wanted, not merely
deluding herself into a pleasing fiction. Lady Cumnor was in that
state of convalescence common to many invalids. The spring of
life had begun again to flow, and with the flow returned the old
desires and projects and plans, which had all become mere matters of
indifference during the worst part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) illness. But as yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
bodily strength was not sufficient to be an agent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) energetic
mind, and the difficulty of driving the ill-matched pair of body and
will--the one weak and languid, the other strong and stern,--made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) ladyship often very irritable. Mrs. Gibson herself was not quite
strong enough for a <div class="bookquote">''_souffre-douleur_;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>and the visit to the Towers
was not, on the whole, quite so happy a one as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had anticipated.
Lady Cuxhaven and Lady Harriet, each aware of their mother's state
of health and temper, but only alluding to it as slightly as was
absolutely necessary in their conversations with each other, took
care not to leave <div class="bookquote">``Clare''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>too long with Lady Cumnor; but several
times when one or the other went to relieve guard they found Clare in
tears, and Lady Cumnor holding forth on some point on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had
been meditating during the silent hours of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) illness, and on which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) seemed to consider herself born to set the world to rights. Mrs.
Gibson was always apt to consider these remarks as addressed with a
personal direction at some error of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own, and defended the fault
in question with a sense of property in it, whatever it might happen
to be. The second and the last day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) stay at the Towers, Lady
Harriet came in, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother haranguing in an excited tone
of voice, and Clare looking submissive and miserable and oppressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, dear mamma? Are not you tiring yourself with
talking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not at all! I was only speaking of the folly of people dressing
above their station. I began by telling Clare of the fashions of
my grandmother's days, when every class had a sort of costume of
its own,--and servants did not ape tradespeople, nor tradespeople
professional men, and so on,--and what must the foolish woman do but
begin to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own dress, as if I had been accusing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or
even thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at all. Such nonsense! Really, Clare, your
husband has spoilt you sadly, if you can't listen to any one without
thinking they are alluding to you. People may flatter themselves
just as much by thinking that their faults are always present to
other people's minds, as if they believe that the world is always
contemplating their individual charms and virtues.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was told, Lady Cumnor, that this silk was reduced in price. I
bought it at Waterloo House after the season was over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gibson, touching the very handsome gown she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wore in deprecation of
Lady Cumnor's angry voice, and blundering on to the very source of
irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Again, Clare! How often must I tell you I had no thought of you or
your gowns, or whether they cost much or little; your husband has to
pay for them, and it is his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) concern if you spend more on your dress
than you ought to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only five guineas for the whole dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>pleaded Mrs. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And very pretty it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, stooping to examine it,
and so hoping to soothe the poor aggrieved woman. But Lady Cumnor
went on,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! you ought to have known me better by this time. When I
think a thing I say it out. I don't beat about the bush. I use
straightforward language. I will tell you where I think you have
been in fault, Clare, if you like to know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>Like it or not, the
plain-speaking was coming now. <div class="bookquote">``You have spoilt that girl of yours
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) does not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) has behaved abominably
to Mr. Preston; and it is all in consequence of the faults in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
education. You have much to answer for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Preston did not wish
it spoken about.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>And at the same moment Mrs. Gibson exclaimed,
<div class="bookquote">``Cynthia--Mr. Preston!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>in such a tone of surprise, that if Lady
Cumnor had been in the habit of observing the revelations made by
other people's tones and voices, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) would have found out that Mrs.
Gibson was ignorant of the affair to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was alluding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for Mr. Preston's wishes, I do not suppose I am bound to regard
them when I feel it my duty to reprove error,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor
loftily to Lady Harriet. <div class="bookquote">``And, Clare, do you mean to say that you are
not aware that your daughter has been engaged to Mr. Preston for some
time--years, I believe,--and has at last chosen to break it off,--and
has used the Gibson girl--I forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) name--as a cat's-paw, and made
both her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) and herself the town's talk--the butt for all the gossip
of Hollingford? I remember when I was young there was a girl called
Jilting Jessy. You'll have to watch over your young lady, or she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
will get some such name. I speak to you like a friend, Clare, when
I tell you it's my opinion that girl of yours will get herself into
some more mischief yet before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s safely married. Not that I care
one straw for Mr. Preston's feelings. I don't even know if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>)'s got
feelings or not; but I know what is becoming in a young woman, and
jilting is not. And now you may both go away, and send Bradley to me,
for I'm tired, and want to have a little sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Lady Cumnor--will you believe me?--I do not think Cynthia
was ever engaged to Mr. Preston. There was an old flirtation. I was
afraid--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ring the bell for Bradley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, wearily: her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) eyes
closed. Lady Harriet had too much experience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother's moods
not to lead Mrs. Gibson away almost by main force, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) protesting
all the while that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not think there was any truth in the
statement, though it was dear Lady Cumnor that said it.

<p/>Once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own room, Lady Harriet said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Clare, I'll tell
you all about it; and I think you'll have to believe it, for it
was Mr. Preston himself who told me. I heard of a great commotion
in Hollingford about Mr. Preston; and I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) riding out, and
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) what it was all about; he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) didn't want to speak about it,
evidently. No man does, I suppose, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been jilted; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made
both papa and me promise not to tell; but papa did--and that's what
mamma has for a foundation; you see, a really good one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Cynthia is engaged to another man--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) really is. And another--a
very good match indeed--has just been offering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) in London. Mr.
Preston is always at the root of mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay! I do think in this case it must be that pretty Miss Cynthia
of yours who has drawn on one man to be engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>),--not to say
two,--and another to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) an offer. I can't endure Mr. Preston,
but I think it's rather hard to accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) of having called up the
rivals, who are, I suppose, the occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) being jilted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; I always feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) owed me a grudge, and men have
so many ways of being spiteful. You must acknowledge that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) had
not met you I should not have had dear Lady Cumnor so angry with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) only wanted to warn you about Cynthia. Mamma has always been
very particular about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own daughters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has been very severe on
the least approach to flirting, and Mary will be like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Cynthia will flirt, and I can't help it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is not noisy, or
giggling; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is always a lady--that everybody must own. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
has a way of attracting men, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have inherited from me, I
think.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And here she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) smiled faintly, and would not have rejected a
confirmatory compliment, but none came. <div class="bookquote">``However, I will speak to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); I will get to the bottom of the whole affair. Pray tell Lady
Cumnor that it has so fluttered me the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) spoke, about my dress
and all. And it only cost five guineas after all, reduced from
eight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, never mind now. You are looking very much flushed; quite
feverish! I left you too long in mamma's hot room. But do you know
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) is so much pleased to have you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>And so Lady Cumnor really
was, in spite of the continual lectures which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) gave <div class="bookquote">``Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
which poor Mrs. Gibson turned under as helplessly as the typical
worm. Still it was something to have a countess to scold her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>); and
that pleasure would endure when the worry was past. And then Lady
Harriet petted her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) more than usual to make up for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had to go
through in the convalescent's room; and Lady Cuxhaven talked sense to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>), with dashes of science and deep thought intermixed, which was
very flattering, although generally unintelligible; and Lord Cumnor,
good-natured, good-tempered, kind, and liberal, was full of gratitude
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cuxhaven</b></font>) kindness in coming to see Lady Cumnor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
gratitude took the tangible shape of a haunch of venison, to say
nothing of lesser game. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) looked back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) visit, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
drove home in the solitary grandeur of the Towers' carriage, there
had been but one great enduring rub--Lady Cumnor's crossness--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
chose to consider Cynthia as the cause of that, instead of seeing the
truth, which had been so often set before her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) by the members of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
ladyship's family, that it took its origin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) state of health.
Mrs. Gibson did not exactly mean to visit this one discomfort upon
Cynthia, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) quite mean to upbraid her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) daughter for conduct
as yet unexplained, and which might have some justification; but,
finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) quietly sitting in the drawing-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sate down
despondingly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own little easy chair, and in reply to Cynthia's
quick pleasant greeting of--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mamma, how are you? We didn't expect you so early! Let me take
off your bonnet and shawl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) replied dolefully,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has not been such a happy visit that I should wish to prolong
it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes were fixed on the carpet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) face was as
irresponsive to the welcome offered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could make it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has been the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Cynthia, in all good faith.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You! Cynthia--you! I little thought when you were born how I should
have to bear to hear you spoken about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head, and angry light came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What business have they with me? How came they to talk about me in
any way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody is talking about you; it is no wonder they are. Lord
Cumnor is sure to hear about everything always. You should take more
care about what you do, Cynthia, if you don't like being talked
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It rather depends upon what people say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, affecting a
lightness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not feel; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had a prevision of what was
coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! I don't like it, at any rate. It is not pleasant to me to hear
first of my daughter's misdoings from Lady Cumnor, and then to be
lectured about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) flirting, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) jilting, as if I had
had anything to do with it. I can assure you it has quite spoilt my
visit. No! don't touch my shawl. When I go to my room I can take it
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia was brought to bay, and sate down; remaining with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother,
who kept sighing ostentatiously from time to time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you mind telling me what they said? If there are accusations
abroad against me, it is as well I should know what they are. Here's
Molly''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as the girl entered the room, fresh from a morning's walk-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``Molly, mamma has come back from the Towers, and my lord and my
lady have been doing me the honour to talk over my crimes and
misdemeanors, and I am asking mamma what they have said. I don't set
up for more virtue than other people, but I can't make out what an
earl and a countess have to do with poor little me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not for your sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``It was for mine. They
felt for me, for it is not pleasant to have one's child's name in
everybody's mouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I said before, that depends upon how it is in everybody's mouth.
If I were going to marry Lord Hollingford, I make no doubt every one
would be talking about me, and neither you nor I should mind it in
the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this is no marriage with Lord Hollingford, so it is nonsense to
talk as if it was. They say you've gone and engaged yourself to Mr.
Preston, and now refuse to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>); and they call that jilting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Cynthia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face in
a flame, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes cast down. Molly stood by, very hot, not fully
understanding it; and only kept where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was by the hope of coming
in as sweetener or peacemaker, or helper of some kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, evidently discomfited by the question. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course I don't; you have gone and entangled yourself with Roger
Hamley, a very worthy young man; but nobody knows where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is, and if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s dead or alive; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has not a penny if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon. I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has some fortune from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mother;

earn fame and great reputation, and with it money will come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said
Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've entangled yourself with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), and you've done something of the

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I sometimes think I'm
the kind of person of which old maids are made!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) spoke seriously,
and a little sadly.

<p/>Mrs. Gibson began again. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to know your secrets as long
as they are secrets; but when all the town is talking about you, I
think I ought to be told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, mamma, I didn't know I was such a subject of conversation; and
even now I can't make out how it has come about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more can I. I only know that they say you've been engaged to Mr.
Preston, and ought to have married him (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>), and that I can't help it, if
you did not choose, any more than I could have helped your refusing
Mr. Henderson; and yet I am constantly blamed for your misconduct.
I think it's very hard.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Gibson began to cry. Just then her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
husband came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You here, my dear! Welcome back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), coming up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
courteously, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter? Tears?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heartily wished himself away again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), raising herself up, and clutching after sympathy of
any kind, at any price. <div class="bookquote">``I'm come home again, and I'm telling Cynthia
how Lady Cumnor has been so cross to me, and all through her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>). Did you
know she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had gone and engaged herself to Mr. Preston, and then broken
it off? Everybody is talking about it, and they know it up at the
Towers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>For one moment his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes met Molly's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) comprehended it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
made his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips up into a whistle, but no sound came. Cynthia had quite
lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) defiant manner since her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother had spoken to Mr. Gibson.
Molly sate down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), very seriously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) answered, softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this true? I had heard something of it before--not much; but
there is scandal enough about to make it desirable that you should
have some protector--some friend who knows the whole truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No answer. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Molly knows it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson, too, had been awed into silence by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband's grave
manner, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not like to give vent to the jealous thought in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind that Molly had known the secret of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was ignorant.
Mr. Gibson replied to Cynthia with some sternness:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I know that Molly knows it all, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has had to bear
slander and ill words for your sake, Cynthia. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) refused to tell
me more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) told you that much, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, aggrieved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) didn't name your name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``At the time I believe
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had concealed it--but there was no mistaking who it
was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) speak about it at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, with some
bitterness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) tone--her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) question stirred up Mr. Gibson's passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to justify herself to me--I heard my
daughter's reputation attacked for the private meetings she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had given
to Mr. Preston--I came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) for an explanation. There's no need to
be ungenerous, Cynthia, because you've been a flirt and a jilt, even
to the degree of dragging Molly's name down into the same mire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) bowed-down head, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say that of me, Mr. Gibson? Not knowing what the circumstances
are, you say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had spoken too strongly: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could not bring
himself to own it just at that moment. The thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sweet
innocent Molly, who had borne so much patiently, prevented any
retractation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) words at the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I do say it. You cannot tell what evil constructions
are put upon actions ever so slightly beyond the bounds of maidenly
propriety. I do say that Molly has had a great deal to bear, in
consequence of this clandestine engagement of yours, Cynthia--there
may be extenuating circumstances, I acknowledge--but you will need
to remember them all to excuse your conduct to Roger Hamley, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) comes home. I asked you to tell me the full truth, in order that
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) comes, and has a legal right to protect you, I may do so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No answer. <div class="bookquote">``It certainly requires explanation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Here
are you,--engaged to two men at once to all appearances!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Still no
answer. <div class="bookquote">``To be sure, the gossips of the town haven't yet picked out
the fact of Roger Hamley's being your accepted lover; but scandal has
been resting on Molly, and ought to have rested on you, Cynthia--for
a concealed engagement to Mr. Preston--necessitating meetings in all
sorts of places unknown to your friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``if you knew all you wouldn't speak so to
Cynthia. I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would tell you herself all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready to hear whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). But Cynthia
said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! you have prejudged me; you have spoken to me as you had no right
to speak. I refuse to give you my confidence, or accept your help.
People are very cruel to me'' (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>--her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) voice trembled for a moment--<div class="bookquote">``I did
not think you would have been. But I can bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>And then, in spite of Molly, who would have detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) by force,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tore herself away, and hastily left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, crying, and clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do let me
tell you all.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) suddenly recollected the awkwardness of
telling some of the details of the story before Mrs. Gibson, and
stopped short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Mr. Gibson, you have been very very unkind to my poor
fatherless child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, emerging from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
pocket-handkerchief. <div class="bookquote">``I only wish her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) poor father had been alive,
and all this would never have happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very probably. Still I cannot see of what either she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) or you have to
complain. Inasmuch as we could, I and mine have sheltered her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)! I have
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) were my own child--as well
as Molly, I do not pretend to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, Mr. Gibson! you do not treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) like your own child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>But in the midst of this wrangle Molly stole out, and went in search
of Cynthia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) bore an olive-branch of healing in the
sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) father's just spoken words: <div class="bookquote">``I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) almost as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were my own child.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>But Cynthia was locked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) room, and
refused to open the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Open to me, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>pleaded Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I have something to say to
you--I want to see you--do open!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``Not now. I am busy. Leave me alone. I don't want
to hear what you have got to say. I don't want to see you. By-and-by
we shall meet, and then--''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly stood quite quietly, wondering
what new words of more persuasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could use. In a minute or two
Cynthia called out, <div class="bookquote">``Are you there still, Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>and when Molly
answered <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>and hoped for a relenting, the same hard metallic
voice, telling of resolution and repression, spoke out, <div class="bookquote">``Go away. I
cannot bear the feeling of your being there--waiting and listening.
Go downstairs--out of the house--anywhere away. It is the most you
can do for me now.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``TROUBLES NEVER COME ALONE.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>Molly had her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) out-of-door things on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) crept away as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was
bidden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heavy weight of heart and body along till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came to a field, not so very far off,--where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had sought the
comfort of loneliness ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was a child; and there, under
the hedge-bank, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sate down, burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands, and
quivering all over as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought of Cynthia's misery, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
might not try to touch or assuage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) never knew how long she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sate
there, but it was long past lunch-time when once again she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stole
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) room. The door opposite was open wide,--Cynthia had
quitted the chamber. Molly arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dress and went down into the
drawing-room. Cynthia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother sate there in the stern repose
of an armed neutrality. Cynthia's face looked made of stone, for
colour and rigidity; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was netting away as if nothing unusual
had occurred. Not so Mrs. Gibson; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face bore evident marks of
tears, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) looked up and greeted Molly's entrance with a faint
smiling notice. Cynthia went on as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had never heard the
opening of the door, or felt the approaching sweep of Molly's dress.
Molly took up a book,--not to read, but to have the semblance of some
employment which should not necessitate conversation.

<p/>There was no measuring the duration of the silence that ensued. Molly
grew to fancy it was some old enchantment that weighed upon their
tongues and kept them still. At length Cynthia spoke, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had to
begin again before her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) words came clear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you both to know that henceforward all is at an end between
me and Roger Hamley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly's book went down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knees; with open eyes and lips she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
strove to draw in Cynthia's meaning. Mrs. Gibson spoke querulously,
as if injured,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could have understood this if it had happened three months
ago,--when you were in London; but now it's just nonsense, Cynthia,
and you know you don't mean it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia did not reply; nor did the resolute look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) face change
when Molly spoke at last,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia--think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)! It will break his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) heart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, <div class="bookquote">``it will not. But even if it did I cannot help
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All this talk will soon pass away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) knows
the truth from your own self--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From my own self he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) shall never hear it. I do not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) well
enough to go through the shame of having to excuse myself,--to
plead that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) will reinstate me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) good opinion. Confession may
be--well! I can never believe it pleasant--but it may be an ease of
mind if one makes it to some people,--to some person,--and it may not
be a mortification to sue for forgiveness. I cannot tell. All I know
is,--and I know it clearly, and will act upon it inflexibly--that--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>And here she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) stopped short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you might finish your sentence,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother, after a
silence of five seconds.

<p/>``I cannot bear to exculpate myself to Roger Hamley. I will not submit
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thinking less well of me than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has done,--however foolish
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) judgment may have been. I would rather never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) again, for
these two reasons. And the truth is, I do not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>). I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), I
respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>); but I will not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>). I have written to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) so.
That was merely as a relief to myself, for when or where the letter
will reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)-- And I have written to old Mr. Hamley. The relief
is the one good thing come out of it all. It is such a comfort
to feel free again. It wearied me so to think of straining up to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) goodness. <div class="bookquote">``Extenuate my conduct!'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) concluded, quoting Mr.
Gibson's words. Yet when Mr. Gibson came home, after a silent dinner,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) asked to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), alone, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) consulting-room; and there
laid bare the exculpation of herself which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had given to Molly
many weeks before. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had ended, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, Mr. Gibson,--I still treat you like a friend,--help me to
find some home far away, where all the evil talking and gossip mamma
tells me of cannot find me and follow me. It may be wrong to care
for people's good opinion,--but it is me, and I cannot alter myself.
You, Molly,--all the people in the town,--I haven't the patience
to live through the nine days' wonder.--I want to go away and be a
governess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Cynthia,--how soon Roger will be back,--a tower of
strength!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has not mamma told you I have broken it all off with Roger? I
wrote this morning. I wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father. That letter will reach
to-morrow. I wrote to Roger. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ever receives that letter, I hope
to be far away by that time; in Russia may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense. An engagement like yours cannot be broken off, except by
mutual consent. You've only given others a great deal of pain without
freeing yourself. Nor will you wish it in a month's time. When you
come to think calmly, you'll be glad to think of the stay and support
of such a husband as Roger. You have been in fault, and have acted
foolishly at first,--perhaps wrongly afterwards; but you don't want
your husband to think you faultless?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate, my lover must think me so.
And it is just because I do not love him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) even as so light a thing as
I could love, that I feel that I couldn't bear to have to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
I'm sorry, and stand before him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) like a chidden child to be admonished
and forgiven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But here you are, just in such a position before me, Cynthia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! but I love you better than Roger; I've often told Molly so. And
I would have told you, if I hadn't expected and hoped to leave you
all before long. I could see if the recollection of it all came up
before your mind; I could see it in your eyes; I should know it by
instinct. I have a fine instinct for reading the thoughts of others
when they refer to me. I almost hate the idea of Roger judging me by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own standard, which wasn't made for me, and graciously forgiving
me at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I do believe it's right for you to break it off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Gibson, almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) were thinking to himself. <div class="bookquote">``That poor poor
lad! But it will be best for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) too. And he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'ll get over it. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has a
good strong heart. Poor old Roger!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment Cynthia's wilful fancy stretched after the object
passing out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) grasp,--Roger's love became for the instant
a treasure; but, again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) knew that in its entirety of high
undoubting esteem, as well as of passionate regard, it would no
longer be hers; and for the flaw which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) herself had made she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cast
it away, and would none of it. Yet often in after years, when it
was too late, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) wondered and strove to penetrate the inscrutable
mystery of <div class="bookquote">``what would have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, take till to-morrow before you act upon your decision,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Gibson, slowly. <div class="bookquote">``What faults you have fallen into have been mere
girlish faults at first,--leading you into much deceit, I grant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't give yourself the trouble to define the shades of blackness,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not so obtuse but what I know them all
better than any one can tell me. And as for my decision I acted upon
it at once. It may be long before Roger gets my letter,--but I hope
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is sure to get it at last,--and, as I said, I have let his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father
know; it won't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)! Oh, sir, I think if I had been differently
brought up I shouldn't have had the sore angry heart I have. Now! No,
don't! I don't want reasoning comfort. I can't stand it. I should
always have wanted admiration and worship, and men's good opinion.
Those unkind gossips! To visit Molly with their hard words! Oh, dear!
I think life is very dreary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hands; tired out mentally as well as
bodily. So Mr. Gibson thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt as if much speech from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
would only add to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) excitement, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) left the
room, and called Molly, from where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sitting, dolefully. <div class="bookquote">``Go
to Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) whispered, and Molly went. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took Cynthia into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
arms with gentle power, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own breast, as
if the one had been a mother, and the other a child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I do so love you, dear, dear
Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hair, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyelids; Cynthia
passive all the while, till suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) started up stung with a new
idea, and looking Molly straight in the face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, Roger will marry you! See if it isn't so! You two good--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Molly pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) away with a sudden violence of repulsion.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was crimson with shame and indignation. <div class="bookquote">``Your
husband this morning! Mine to-night! What do you take him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>smiled Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``And therefore, if you won't let me call
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) changeable, I'll coin a word and call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consolable!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>But Molly
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) back no answering smile. At this moment, the servant Maria
entered the consulting-room, where the two girls were. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had a
scared look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't master here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) distrusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go out. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut the front
door not five minutes ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria. <div class="bookquote">``And there's a man come on horseback from
Hamley Hall, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) says as Mr. Osborne is dead, and that master must
go off to the Squire straight away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne Hamley dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, in awed surprise. Molly was out
at the front door, seeking the messenger through the dusk, round into
the stable-yard, where the groom sate motionless on his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) dark horse,
flecked with foam, made visible by the lantern placed on the steps
near, where it had been left by the servants, who were dismayed at
this news of the handsome young man who had frequented their master's
house, so full of sportive elegance and winsomeness. Molly went up to
the man, whose thoughts were lost in recollection of the scene he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
left at the place he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come from.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand on the hot damp skin of the horse's shoulder; the
man started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the doctor coming, Miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw who it was by the dim light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is dead, is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afeard he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is,--leastways, there's no doubt according to what
they said. But I've ridden hard! there may be a chance. Is the doctor
coming, Miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is gone out. They are seeking him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), I believe. I will go myself.
Oh! the poor old Squire!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went into the kitchen--went over the
house with swift rapidity to gain news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's whereabouts.
The servants knew no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did. Neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) nor they had
heard what Cynthia, ever quick of perception, had done. The shutting
of the front door had fallen on deaf ears, as far as others were
concerned. Upstairs sped Molly to the drawing-room, where Mrs. Gibson
stood at the door, listening to the unusual stir in the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Molly? Why, how white you look, child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone out. What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I know? I was asleep; Jenny came upstairs on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) way to
the bedrooms; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'s a girl who never keeps to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) work and Maria
takes advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny, Jenny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>cried Molly, frantic at the delay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't shout, dear,--ring the bell. What can be the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jenny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, half-way up the stairs to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``who
wanted papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia came to join the group; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) too had been looking for traces
or tidings of Mr. Gibson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``Can nobody speak and answer
a question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne Hamley is dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead! Osborne! Poor fellow! I knew it would be so, though,--I was
sure of it. But Mr. Gibson can do nothing if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s dead. Poor young
man! I wonder where Roger is now? He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ought to come home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny had been blamed for coming into the drawing-room instead
of Maria, whose place it was, and so had lost the few wits she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
had. To Molly's hurried questions her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) replies had been entirely
unsatisfactory. A man had come to the back door--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not
see who it was--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had not asked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to speak to
master,--master had seemed in a hurry, and only stopped to get his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will not be long away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>thought Molly, <div class="bookquote">``or he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would have left
word where he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was going. But oh! the poor father all alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>And then
a thought came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) acted upon straight. <div class="bookquote">``Go to
James, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to put the side-saddle I had in November on Nora
Creina. Don't cry, Jenny. There's no time for that. No one is angry
with you. Run!''

 (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div><p/>So down into the cluster of collected women Molly came, equipped in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) jacket and skirt; quick determination in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes; controlled
quivering about the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson--<div class="bookquote">``Molly, what are you
thinking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>But Cynthia had understood it at a glance, and was
arranging Molly's hastily assumed dress, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) passed along.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going. I must go. I cannot bear to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) alone. When
papa comes back he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is sure to go to Hamley, and if I am not wanted, I
can come back with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard Mrs. Gibson's voice following her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
in remonstrance, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not stay for words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had to wait in
the stable-yard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wondered how the messenger could bear to eat
and drink the food and beer brought out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) by the servants. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
coming out had evidently interrupted the eager talk,--the questions
and answers passing sharp to and fro; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) caught the words, <div class="bookquote">``all
amongst the tangled grass,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``the Squire would let none on us
touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) up as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was a baby; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had to rest many
a time, and once he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sate him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) down on the ground; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) kept
him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) arms; but we thought we should ne'er have gotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) up
again--him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) and the body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The body!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had never felt that Osborne was really dead till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard
those words. They rode quick under the shadows of the hedgerow trees,
but when they slackened speed, to go up a brow, or to give their
horses breath, Molly heard those two little words again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ears;
and said them over again to herself, in hopes of forcing the sharp
truth into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) unwilling sense. But when they came in sight of the
square stillness of the house, shining in the moonlight--the moon had
risen by this time--Molly caught at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) breath, and for an instant
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) never could go in, and face the presence in that
dwelling. One yellow light burnt steadily, spotting the silver
shining with its earthly coarseness. The man pointed it out: it was
almost the first word he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spoken since they had left Hollingford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the old nursery. They carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) there. The Squire broke down
at the stair-foot, and they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) to the readiest place. I'll be
bound for it the Squire is there hisself, and old Robin too. They
fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), as a knowledgable man among dumb beasts, till th'
regular doctor came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly dropped down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) seat before the man could dismount to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) gathered up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) skirts and did not stay again to think
of what was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ran along the once familiar turns, and
swiftly up the stairs, and through the doors, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came to the
last; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stopped and listened. It was a deathly silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
opened the door:--the Squire was sitting alone at the side of the
bed, holding the dead man's hand, and looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
at vacancy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not stir or move, even so much as an eyelid, at
Molly's entrance. The truth had entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) soul before this, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) knew that no doctor, be he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) ever so cunning, could, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
striving, put the breath into that body again. Molly came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
with the softest steps, the most hushed breath that ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not speak, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not know what to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
had no more hope from earthly skill, so what was the use of speaking
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father and the delay in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) coming? After a moment's pause,
standing by the old man's side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) slipped down to the floor, and
sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet. Possibly her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) presence might have some balm in it;
but uttering of words was as a vain thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must have been aware
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) being there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took no apparent notice. There they sate,
silent and still, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) on the floor; the dead man,
beneath the sheet, for a third. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must have
disturbed the father in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) contemplation of the quiet face, now more
than half, but not fully, covered up out of sight. Time had never
seemed so without measure, silence had never seemed so noiseless as
it did to Molly, sitting there. In the acuteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) senses she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
heard a step mounting a distant staircase, coming slowly, coming
nearer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew it not to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's, and that was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
cared about. Nearer and nearer--close to the outside of the door--a
pause, and a soft hesitating tap. The great gaunt figure sitting by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) side quivered at the sound. Molly rose and went to the door: it
was Robinson, the old butler, holding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) hand a covered basin of
soup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) touch a drop o' this: he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s
gone since breakfast without food, and it's past one in the morning
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) softly removed the cover, and Molly took the basin back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) place at the Squire's side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not speak, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not
well know what to say, or how to present this homely want of nature
before one so rapt in grief. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) put a spoonful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) lips, and
touched them with the savoury food, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been a sick child,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) the nurse; and instinctively he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took down the first spoonful
of the soup. But in a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said, with a sort of cry, and almost
overturning the basin Molly held, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) passionate gesture as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
pointed to the bed,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will never eat again--never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) threw himself across the corpse, and wept in such a terrible
manner that Molly trembled lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) also should die--should break his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
heart there and then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took no more notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) words, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
tears, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) presence, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did of that of the moon, looking
through the unclosed window, with passionless stare. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father stood
by them both before either of them was aware.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go downstairs, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gravely; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head
tenderly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) rose. <div class="bookquote">``Go into the dining-room.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt the
reaction from all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) self-control. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) trembled with fear as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
went along the moonlit passages. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should
meet Osborne, and hear it all explained; how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came to die,--what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
now felt and thought and wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did get down to the
dining-room,--the last few steps with a rush of terror,--senseless
terror of what might be behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found supper laid
out, and candles lit, and Robinson bustling about decanting some
wine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wanted to cry; to get into some quiet place, and weep away
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) over-excitement; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could hardly do so there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only felt
very much tired, and to care for nothing in this world any more. But
vividness of life came back when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found Robinson holding a glass
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lips as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sat in the great leather easy-chair, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had gone instinctively as to a place of rest.

<p/>``Drink, Miss.. It's good old Madeira. Your papa said as how you was to
eat a bit. Says he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), ``My daughter may have to stay here, Mr. Robinson,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s young for the work. Persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to eat something, or
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'ll break down utterly.<div class="bookquote">'' Those was his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) very words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly did not say anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had not energy enough for resistance.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) drank and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ate at the old servant's bidding; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) alone, and went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) easy-chair and let
herself cry, and so ease her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart.




<p/>CHAPTER LII.

<p/>SQUIRE HAMLEY``S SORROW.


<p/>It seemed very long before Mr. Gibson came down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went and stood
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) back to the empty fireplace, and did not speak for a minute
or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s gone to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) at length. <div class="bookquote">``Robinson and I have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>)
there. But just as I was leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) called me back and asked
me to let you stop. I'm sure I don't know--but one doesn't like to
refuse at such a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you? There's a good girl. But how will you manage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, never mind that. I can manage. Papa,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) paused--<div class="bookquote">``what did
Osborne die of?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) asked the question in a low, awe-stricken voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something wrong about the heart. You wouldn't understand if I told
you. I apprehended it for some time; but it's better not to talk
of such things at home. When I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) on Thursday week, he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) seemed
better than I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) for a long time. I told Dr. Nicholls so.
But one never can calculate in these complaints.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) on Thursday week? Why, you never mentioned it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said
Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I don't talk of my patients at home. Besides, I didn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>)
to consider me as his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) doctor, but as a friend. Any alarm about his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>)
own health would only have hastened the catastrophe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) was ill--ill of a dangerous complaint,
I mean: one that might end as it has done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; certainly not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) would only have been watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>)
symptoms--accelerating matters, in fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, shocked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no time to go into the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gibson continued. <div class="bookquote">``And
until you know what has to be said on both sides and in every
instance, you are not qualified to judge. We must keep our attention
on the duties in hand now. You sleep here for the remainder of the
night, which is more than half-gone already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Promise me to go to bed just as usual. You may not think it, but
most likely you'll go to sleep at once. People do at your age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I think I ought to tell you something. I know a great secret
of Osborne's, which I promised solemnly not to tell; but the last
time I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) must have been afraid of something like
this.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>A fit of sobbing came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), which her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father was afraid
would end in hysterics. But suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mastered herself, and looked
up into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) anxious face, and smiled to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not help it, papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I know. Go on with what you were saying. You ought to be in bed;
but if you've a secret on your mind you won't sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne was married,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``That
is the secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married! Nonsense. What makes you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) told me. That's to say, I was in the library--was reading there,
some time ago; and Roger came and spoke to Osborne about his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife.
Roger did not see me, but Osborne did. They made me promise secrecy.
I don't think I did wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry yourself about right or wrong just now; tell me more
about it, at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew no more till six months ago--last November, when you went up
to Lady Cumnor. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) called, and gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife's address, but
still under promise of secrecy; and, except those two times, and once
when Roger just alluded to it, I have never heard any one mention the
subject. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would have told me more that last time, only Miss
Phoebe came in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is this wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Down in the south; near Winchester, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a
Frenchwoman and a Roman Catholic; and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a
servant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>added Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phew!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father made a long whistle of dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>continued Molly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke of a child. Now you know as much as
I do, papa, except the address. I have it written down safe at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Forgetting, apparently, what time of night it was, Mr. Gibson sate
down, stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) legs before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
pockets, and began to think. Molly sate still without speaking, too
tired to do more than wait.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) at last, jumping up, <div class="bookquote">``nothing can be done to-night;
by to-morrow morning, perhaps, I may find out. Poor little pale
face!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--taking it between both his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hands and kissing it; <div class="bookquote">``poor,
sweet, little pale face!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rang the bell, and told Robinson to
send some maid-servant to take Miss Gibson to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) won't be up early,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), in parting. <div class="bookquote">``The shock has lowered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) too much to be energetic. Send breakfast up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own
room. I'll be here again before ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Late as it was before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you and I must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the truth between us.
I don't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will take it; it may comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), but I've very
little hope: either way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ought to know it at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Robinson says he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) has gone into the room again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) is afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>)
has locked the door on the inside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind. I shall ring the bell, and send up Robinson to say that
I am here, and wish to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The message returned was, <div class="bookquote">``The Squire's kind love, and could not see
Mr. Gibson just then.''  (<font color='red'><b>Robinson</b></font>)</div>Robinson added, <div class="bookquote">``It was a long time before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'d answer at all, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robinson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go up again, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) I can wait his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) convenience. Now that's a
lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gibson said, turning round to Molly as soon as Robinson had
left the room. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to be far enough away at twelve; but, if I'm
not much mistaken, the innate habits of a gentleman will make him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
uneasy at the idea of keeping me waiting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pleasure, and will do
more to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) out of that room into this than any entreaties or
reasoning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gibson was growing impatient though, before they
heard the Squire's footstep on the stairs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was evidently coming
slowly and unwillingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came in almost like one blind, groping
along, and taking hold of chair or table for support or guidance till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reached Mr. Gibson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not speak when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) held the doctor by
the hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) only hung down his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head, and kept on a feeble shaking of
welcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm brought very low, sir. I suppose it's God's doing; but it comes
hard upon me. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was my firstborn child.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said this almost as if
speaking to a stranger, and informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of facts of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was
ignorant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, choking a little himself, and
pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) forwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon; I did not see you at first. My mind is a good
deal occupied just now.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sate heavily down, and then seemed almost
to forget they were there. Molly wondered what was to come next.
Suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father spoke,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Roger?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) not likely to be soon at the Cape?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got up and looked at the directions of one or two unopened letters
brought by that morning's post; among them was one in Cynthia's
handwriting. Both Molly and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw it at the same time. How long it
was since yesterday! But the Squire took no notice of their
proceedings or their looks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be glad to have Roger at home as soon as may be, I think,
sir. Some months must elapse first; but I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will return as
speedily as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire said something in a very low voice. Both father and
daughter strained their ears to hear what it was. They both believed
it to be, <div class="bookquote">``Roger isn't Osborne!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Gibson spoke on that belief.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) spoke more quietly than Molly had ever heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) do before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! we know that. I wish that anything that Roger could do, or that
I could do, or that any one could do, would comfort you; but it is
past human comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do try to say, God's will be done, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, looking
up at Mr. Gibson for the first time, and speaking with more life in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) voice; <div class="bookquote">``but it's harder to be resigned than happy people think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>They were all silent for a while. The Squire himself was the first
to speak again,--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was my first child, sir; my eldest son. And
of late years we weren't'' (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) voice broke down, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) controlled
himself--<div class="bookquote">``we weren't quite as good friends as could be wished; and
I'm not sure--not sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew how I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
cried aloud with an exceeding bitter cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>whispered Mr. Gibson to Molly. <div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s a little
calmer, don't be afraid; tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) all you know, exactly as it
happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly began. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) voice sounded high and unnatural to herself, as if
some one else was speaking, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) words clear. The Squire
did not attempt to listen, at first, at any rate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One day when I was here, at the time of Mrs. Hamley's last illness''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the Squire here checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) convulsive breathing-RRB-, ``I was in the
library, and Osborne came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had only come in for a book,
and that I was not to mind him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), so I went on reading. Presently,
Roger came along the flagged garden-path just outside the window
-LRB-which was open-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not see me in the corner where I was
sitting, and said to Osborne, <div class="bookquote">``Here's a letter from your wife!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>Now the Squire was all attention; for the first time his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tear-swollen
eyes met the eyes of another, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) looked at Molly with searching
anxiety, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife! Osborne married!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Molly went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne was angry with Roger for speaking out before me, and they
made me promise never to mention it to any one; or to allude to it to
either of them again. I never named it to papa till last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``Tell the Squire about Osborne's call--what
you told me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>Still the Squire hung on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lips, listening with open
mouth and eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some months ago Osborne called. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was not well, and wanted to see
papa. Papa was away, and I was alone. I don't exactly remember how
it came about, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) spoke to me of his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) wife for the first and only
time since the affair in the library.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, as
if questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) as to the desirableness of telling the few further
particulars that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew. The Squire's mouth was dry and stiff, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tried to say, <div class="bookquote">``Tell me all,--everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Molly understood the
half-formed words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) wife was a good woman, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dearly;

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know nothing about it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire sharply. <div class="bookquote">``You don't

with all this weight on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind. I won't have people interfering and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne evidently had bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) down to secrecy, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) bound

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne was such a fellow for persuading people, and winning them
over,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, dreamily. <div class="bookquote">``I remember--but what's the use of
remembering? It's all over, and Osborne's dead without opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
heart to me. I could have been tender to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), I could. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we can guess what wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had strongest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind at the last,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, with sharp suspicion of what was
coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) last thought, must she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) not?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), turning round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) suddenly, <div class="bookquote">''--child? You never

knew! God bless Osborne's child! I say, God bless it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood up
reverently, and the other two instinctively rose. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands
as if in momentary prayer. Then exhausted he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sate down again, and put
out his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand to Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a good girl. Thank you.--Tell me what I ought to do, and I'll

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)'ll come back again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) shall come back this evening. I'll manage to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
somehow. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) has no clothes but the habit she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) came in, and I want
my horse that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) rode away upon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the carriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``Take anything. I'll give

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This afternoon; the carriage shall be at your house at three. I dare

yet I shall never rest till I know more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll send the desk in by Robinson before I leave. And--can you give
me some lunch before I go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Little by little he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) led the Squire to eat a morsel or so of food;
and so, strengthening him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) physically, and encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mentally,
Mr. Gibson hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) would begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) researches during Molly's
absence.

<p/>There was something touching in the Squire's wistful looks after
Molly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) moved about. A stranger might have imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to
be his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) daughter instead of Mr. Gibson's. The meek, broken-down,
considerate ways of the bereaved father never showed themselves more
strongly than when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) called them back to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair, out of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed too languid to rise, and said, as if by an after-thought:
<div class="bookquote">``Give my love to Miss Kirkpatrick; tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) I look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) as quite
one of the family. I shall be glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) after--after the
funeral. I don't think I can before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) knows nothing of Cynthia's resolution to give up Roger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr.

she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was as resolute as ever. From what your mamma tells me, there is
a third lover in London, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s already refused. I'm thankful
that you've no lover at all, Molly, unless that abortive attempt of
Mr. Coxe's at an offer, long ago, can be called a lover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard of it, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; I forgot. What a fool I was! Why, don't you remember the

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>But Molly was too tired to be amused, or even interested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could
not get over the sight of the straight body covered with a sheet,
which yet let the outlines be seen,--all that remained of Osborne.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) father had trusted too much to the motion of the ride, and the
change of scene from the darkened house. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mistake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some one must write to Mrs. Osborne Hamley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you, please, papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, if you wish. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) may have heard of you as a friend of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) dead husband's; while of me--a mere country doctor--it's very
probable she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has never heard the name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I ought, I will do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gibson did not like this ready
acquiescence, given in so few words, too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Hollingford church-spire,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) presently, as they drew
near the town, and caught a glimpse of the church through the trees.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I never wish to go out of sight of it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why, you've all your travelling to do yet;
and if these new-fangled railways spread, as they say they will, we
shall all be spinning about the world; `sitting on tea-kettles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>as
Phoebe Browning calls it. Miss Browning wrote such a capital letter
of advice to Miss Hornblower. I heard of it at the Millers'. Miss
Hornblower was going to travel by railroad for the first time; and
Dorothy was very anxious, and sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) directions for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) conduct;
one piece of advice was not to sit on the boiler.''

<p/>Molly laughed a little, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was expected to do. <div class="bookquote">``Here we are at
home, at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson gave Molly a warm welcome. For one thing, Cynthia was
in disgrace; for another, Molly came from the centre of news; for a
third, Mrs. Gibson was really fond of the girl, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) way, and sorry
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) pale heavy looks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think of it all being so sudden at last! Not but what I always
expected it! And so provoking! Just when Cynthia had given up Roger!
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had only waited a day! What does the Squire say to it all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is beaten down with grief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>replied Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! I should not have fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had liked the engagement so
much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What engagement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Roger to Cynthia, to be sure. I asked you how the Squire took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) letter, announcing the breaking of it off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I made a mistake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hasn't opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) letters to-day. I saw
Cynthia's among them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that I call positive disrespect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not mean it for such. Where is Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone out into the meadow-garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'ll be in directly. I wanted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to do some errands for me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) flatly refused to go into the
town. I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mismanages her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) affairs badly. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) won't
allow me to interfere. I hate to look at such things in a mercenary
spirit, but it is provoking to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) throw over two such good
matches. First Mr. Henderson, and now Roger Hamley. When does the
Squire expect Roger? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) think he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) will come back sooner for poor
dear Osborne's death?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hardly seems to think of anything but Osborne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
appears to me to have almost forgotten every one else. But perhaps
the news of Osborne's being married, and of the child, may rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had no doubt that Osborne was really and truly married, nor
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) any idea that her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) father had never breathed the facts of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on the previous night, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife or Cynthia.
But Mr. Gibson had been slightly dubious of the full legality of
the marriage, and had not felt inclined to speak of it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife
until that had been ascertained one way or another. So Mrs. Gibson
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``What _do_ you mean, child? Married! Osborne married! Who
says so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear! I suppose I ought not to have named it. I'm very stupid
to-day. Yes! Osborne has been married a long time; but the Squire did
not know of it until this morning. I think it has done him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) good. But
I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is the lady? Why, I call it a shame to go about as a single man,
and be married all the time! If there is one thing that revolts me,
it is duplicity. Who is the lady? Do tell me all you know about it,
there's a dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is French, and a Roman Catholic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``French! They are such beguiling women; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so much abroad!
You said there was a child,--is it a boy or a girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not hear. I did not ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly did not think it necessary to do more than answer questions;
indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was vexed enough to have told anything of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father
evidently considered it desirable to keep secret. Just then Cynthia
came wandering into the room with a careless, hopeless look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
face, which Molly noticed at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had not heard of Molly's
arrival, and had no idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was returned until she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
sitting there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, darling! Is that you? You're as welcome as the flowers in
May, though you've not been gone twenty-four hours. But the house
isn't the same when you are away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) brings us such news too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``I'm really
almost glad you wrote to the Squire yesterday, for if you had waited
till to-day--I thought you were in too great a hurry at the time--he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
might have thought you had some interested reason for giving up your
engagement. Osborne Hamley was married all this time unknown to
everybody, and has got a child too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Osborne married!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``If ever a man looked a
bachelor, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did. Poor Osborne! with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fair delicate elegance,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked so young and boyish!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! it was a great piece of deceit, and I can't easily forgive
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for it. Only think! If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had paid either of you any particular
attention, and you had fallen in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have
broken your heart, or Molly's either. I can't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), even
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is dead, poor fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never did pay either of us any particular attention, and
as we neither of us did fall in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I think I only feel
sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had all the trouble and worry of concealment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia
spoke with a pretty keen recollection of how much trouble and worry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) concealment had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now of course it is a son, and will be the heir, and Roger will
just be as poorly off as ever. I hope you'll take care and let the
Squire know Cynthia was quite ignorant of these new facts that have
come out when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) wrote those letters, Molly? I should not like a
suspicion of worldliness to rest upon any one with whom I had any
concern.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hasn't read Cynthia's letter yet. Oh, do let me bring it home
unopened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Send another letter to Roger--now--at once;
it will reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) at the same time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will get both when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) arrives
at the Cape, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) understand which is the last--the real one.
Think! he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will hear of Osborne's death at the same time--two such sad
things! Do, Cynthia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``I could not allow that, even if
Cynthia felt inclined for it. Asking to be re-engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)! At
any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) must wait now until he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) proposes again, and we see how
things turn out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>But Molly kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pleading eyes fixed on Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia firmly, but not without consideration. <div class="bookquote">``It cannot
be. I've felt more content this last night than I've done for weeks
past. I'm glad to be free. I dreaded Roger's goodness, and learning,
and all that. It was not in my way, and I don't believe I should
have ever married him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), even without knowing of all these ill-natured
stories that are circulating about me, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would hear of,
and expect me to explain, and be sorry for, and penitent and humble.
I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not have made me happy, and I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would
have been happy with me. It must stay as it is. I would rather be a
governess than married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). I should get weary of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) every day of
my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Weary of Roger!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly to herself. <div class="bookquote">``It is best as it is, I
see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) answered aloud. <div class="bookquote">``Only I'm very sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), very. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did
love you so. You will never get any one to love you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I must take my chance. And too much love is rather

about; not all confined to one individual lover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``But don't let us talk any more
about it. It is best as it is. I thought--I almost felt sure you
would be sorry this morning. But we will leave it alone now.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
sate silently looking out of the window, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart sorely stirred,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) scarcely knew how or why. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not have spoken. Most
likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have begun to cry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had spoken. Cynthia stole
softly up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) after a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are vexed with me, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) began in a low voice. But Molly
turned sharply round:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I! I have no business at all in the affair. It is for you to judge.
Do what you think right. I believe you have done right. Only I don't
want to discuss it, and paw it over with talk. I'm very much tired,
dear'' (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>--gently now she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke--<div class="bookquote">``and I hardly know what I say. If I
speak crossly, don't mind it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Cynthia did not reply at once. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I might go with you, and help you? I might have done
yesterday; and you say he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hasn't opened my letter, so he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has not
heard as yet. And I was always fond of poor Osborne, in my way, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell; I have no right to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>replied Molly, scarcely
understanding Cynthia's motives, which, after all, were only impulses
in this case. <div class="bookquote">``Papa would be able to judge; I think, perhaps, you had
better not. But don't go by my opinion; I can only tell what I should
wish to do in your place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was as much for your sake as any one's, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, then, don't! I am tired to-day with sitting up; but to-morrow
I shall be all right; and I should not like it, if, for my sake, you
came into the house at so solemn a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, half-glad that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) impulsive offer was
declined; for, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said, thinking to herself, <div class="bookquote">``It would have
been awkward after all.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So Molly went back in the carriage alone,
wondering how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should find the Squire; wondering what discoveries
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had made among Osborne's papers, and at what conviction he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would
have arrived.




<p/>CHAPTER LIII.

<p/>UNLOOKED-FOR ARRIVALS.


<p/>Robinson opened the door for Molly almost before the carriage had
fairly drawn up at the Hall, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that the Squire had been
very anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) return, and had more than once sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) to
an upstairs window, from which a glimpse of the hill-road between
Hollingford and Hamley could be caught, to know if the carriage was
not yet in sight. Molly went into the drawing-room. The Squire was
standing in the middle of the floor awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)--in fact, longing to
go out and meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), but restrained by a feeling of solemn etiquette,
which prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) moving about as usual in that house of mourning.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) held a paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands, which were trembling with excitement
and emotion; and four or five open letters were strewed on a table
near him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) began; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'s her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband--was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband--that's the word for it--was! Poor lad! poor lad! it's
cost him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a deal. Pray God, it wasn't my fault. Read this, my dear.
It's a certificate. It's all regular--Osborne Hamley to Marie-Aimée
Scherer,--parish-church and all, and witnessed. Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sate
down in the nearest chair and groaned. Molly took a seat by him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and
read the legal paper, the perusal of which was not needed to convince
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) of the fact of the marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) held it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand after she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had finished reading it, waiting for the Squire's next coherent
words; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) kept talking to himself in broken sentences. <div class="bookquote">``Ay,
ay! that comes o' temper, and crabbedness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was the only one as
could,--and I've been worse since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was gone. Worse! worse! and
see what it has come to! He (<font color='blue'><b>Scherer</b></font>) was afraid of me--ay--afraid. That's the
truth of it--afraid. And it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Scherer</b></font>) keep all to himself, and care
killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Scherer</b></font>). They may call it heart-disease--O my lad, my lad, I know
better now; but it's too late--that's the sting of it--too late, too
late!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) face, and moved himself backward and forward
till Molly could bear it no longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are some letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``may I read any of them?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At
another time she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would not have asked; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was driven to it now
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) impatience of the speechless grief of the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, read 'em, read 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Maybe you can. I can only pick
out a word here and there. I put 'em there for you to look at; and
tell me what is in 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly's knowledge of written French of the present day was not so
great as her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knowledge of the French of the _Mémoires de Sully_, and
neither the spelling nor the writing of the letters was of the best;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) managed to translate into good enough colloquial English some
innocent sentences of love, and submission to Osborne's will--as if
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judgment was infallible,--and of faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purposes,--little
sentences in <div class="bookquote">``little language''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>that went home to the Squire's heart.
Perhaps if Molly had read French more easily she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might not have
translated them into such touching, homely, broken words. Here and
there, there were expressions in English; these the hungry-hearted
Squire had read while waiting for Molly's return. Every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Go on.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) face shaded, and only repeated
those two words at every pause. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) got up to find some more of
Aimée's letters. In examining the papers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came upon one in
particular. <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen this, sir? This certificate of baptism''
 (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>-LRB-reading aloud-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``of Roger Stephen Osborne Hamley, born June 21,
183--, child of Osborne Hamley and Marie-Aimée his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) wife--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) voice breaking now, and stretching
forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eager hand. ''`Roger,' that's me, ``Stephen,<div class="bookquote">'' that's my poor
old father: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not so old as I am; but I've always
thought on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as very old. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was main and fond of Osborne, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was quite a little one. It's good of the lad to have thought on my
father Stephen. Ay! that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) name. And Osborne--Osborne Hamley!
One Osborne Hamley lies dead on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) bed--and t`other--t`other I've
never seen, and never heard on till to-day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) must be called
Osborne, Molly. There is a Roger--there's two for that matter; but
one is a good-for-nothing old man; and there's never an Osborne any
more, unless this little thing is called Osborne; we'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
here, and get a nurse for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother comfortable for
life in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own country. I'll keep this, Molly. You're a good lass
for finding it. Osborne Hamley! And if God will give me grace, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
shall never hear a cross word from me--never! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shan't be afeard of
me. Oh, _my_ Osborne, _my_ Osborne''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger Stephen Osborne Hamley/Stephen</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) burst out-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``do you know now
how bitter and sore is my heart for every hard word as I ever spoke
to you? Do you know now how I loved you--my boy--my boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>From the general tone of the letters, Molly doubted if the mother
would consent, so easily as the Squire seemed to expect, to be parted
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) child; the letters were not very wise, perhaps -LRB-though of
this Molly never thought-RRB-, but a heart full of love spoke tender
words in every line. Still, it was not for Molly to talk of this
doubt of hers just then; but rather to dwell on the probable graces
and charms of the little Roger Stephen Osborne Hamley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) let
the Squire exhaust himself in wondering as to the particulars of
every event, helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) out in conjectures; and both of them, from
their imperfect knowledge of possibilities, made the most curious,
fantastic, and improbable guesses at the truth. And so that day
passed over, and the night came.

<p/>There were not many people who had any claim to be invited to the
funeral, and of these Mr. Gibson and the Squire's hereditary man of
business had taken charge. But when Mr. Gibson came, early on the
following morning, Molly referred the question to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), which had
suggested itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mind, though apparently not to the Squire's,
what intimation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) loss should be sent to the widow, living
solitary near Winchester, watching and waiting, if not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) coming
who lay dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) distant home, at least for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) letters. One from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had already come, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) foreign handwriting, to the post-office
to which all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) communications were usually sent, but of course they
at the Hall knew nothing of this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) must be told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, musing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) must,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daughter. <div class="bookquote">``But how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A day or two of waiting will do no harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), almost as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was anxious to delay the solution of the problem. <div class="bookquote">``It will make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) anxious, poor thing, and all sorts of gloomy possibilities will
suggest themselves to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) mind--amongst them the truth; it will be a
kind of preparation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For what? Something must be done at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; true. Suppose you write, and say he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s very ill; write
to-morrow. I daresay they've indulged themselves in daily postage,
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'ll have had three days' silence. You say how you come
to know all you do about it; I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) ought to know he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is very
ill--in great danger, if you like: and you can follow it up next day
with the full truth. I wouldn't worry the Squire about it. After the
funeral we will have a talk about the child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) will never part with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whew! Till I see the woman I can't tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>father women</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``some
women would. It will be well provided for, according to what you say.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a foreigner, and may very likely wish to go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
own people and kindred. There's much to be said on both sides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father women</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you always say, papa. But in this case I think you'll find I'm
right. I judge from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) letters; but I think I'm right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you always say, daughter. Time will show. So the child is a
boy? Mrs. Gibson told me particularly to ask. It will go far to
reconciling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to Cynthia's dismissal of Roger. But indeed it is
quite as well for both of them, though of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will be a long
time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thinks so. They were not suited to each other. Poor
Roger! It was hard work writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) yesterday; and who knows what
may have become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)! Well, well! one has to get through the world
somehow. I'm glad, however, this little lad has turned up to be the
heir. I shouldn't have liked the property to go to the Irish Hamleys,
who are the next heirs, as Osborne once told me. Now write that
letter, Molly, to the poor little Frenchwoman out yonder. It will
prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for it; and we must think a bit how to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) the
shock, for Osborne's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>The writing this letter was rather difficult work for Molly, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tore up two or three copies before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could manage it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
satisfaction; and at last, in despair of ever doing it better, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
sent it off without re-reading it. The next day was easier; the fact
of Osborne's death was told briefly and tenderly. But when this
second letter was sent off, Molly's heart began to bleed for the
poor creature, bereft of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband, in a foreign land, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at a
distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), dead and buried without her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ever having had the
chance of printing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dear features on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) memory by one last long
lingering look. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thoughts full of the unknown Aimée, Molly
talked much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) that day to the Squire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would listen for
ever to any conjecture, however wild, about the grandchild, but
perpetually winced away from all discourse about <div class="bookquote">``the Frenchwoman,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the grandchild</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); not unkindly, but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was simply the
Frenchwoman--chattering, dark-eyed, demonstrative, and possibly even
rouged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with respect as his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son's widow, and
would try even not to think upon the female inveiglement in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
believed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) an allowance to the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) duty:
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hoped and trusted he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might never be called upon to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) solicitor, Gibson, anybody and everybody, should be called upon
to form a phalanx of defence against that danger.

<p/>And all this time a little young grey-eyed woman was making her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
way,--not towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), but towards the dead son, whom as yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
believed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) living husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was acting in
defiance of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) expressed wish; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never dismayed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with
any expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own fears about his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) health; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), bright
with life, had never contemplated death coming to fetch away one so
beloved. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was ill--very ill, the letter from the strange girl said
that; but Aimée had nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parents, and knew what illness was.
The French doctor had praised her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) skill and neat-handedness as a
nurse, and even if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been the clumsiest of women, was he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) not
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband--her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) all? And was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife, whose place was by
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pillow? So, without even as much reasoning as has been here
given, Aimée made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) preparations, swallowing down the tears that
would overflow her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes, and drop into the little trunk she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
packing so neatly. And by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side, on the ground, sate the child,
now nearly two years old; and for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) Aimée had always a smile and a
cheerful word. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) servant loved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and trusted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and the woman
was of an age to have had experience of humankind. Aimée had told
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband was ill, and the servant had known enough of
the household history to be aware that as yet Aimée was not his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
acknowledged wife. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sympathized with the prompt decision of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mistress to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) directly, wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was. Caution comes
from education of one kind or another, and Aimée was not dismayed by
warnings; only the woman pleaded hard for the child to be left. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>)
was such company,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) would so tire his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
journeyings; and maybe his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) father would be too ill to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>To
which Aimée replied, <div class="bookquote">``Good company for you, but better for me. A
woman is never tired with carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own child''  (<font color='red'><b>Aimée</b></font>)</div>-LRB-which was not
true; but there was sufficient truth in it to make it believed by
both mistress and servant-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and if Monsieur could care for anything,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) would rejoice to hear the babble of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) little son.''  (<font color='red'><b>servant</b></font>)</div>So Aimée
caught the evening coach to London at the nearest cross-road, Martha
standing by as chaperon and friend to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) off, and handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>)
in the large lusty child, already crowing with delight at the sight
of the horses. There was a <div class="bookquote">``lingerie''  (<font color='red'><b>a Frenchwoman</b></font>)</div>shop, kept by a Frenchwoman,
whose acquaintance Aimée had made in the days when she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) was a London
nursemaid, and thither she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) betook herself, rather than to an hotel,
to spend the few night-hours that intervened before the Birmingham
coach started at early morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) slept or watched on a sofa in
the parlour, for spare-bed there was none; but Madame Pauline came
in betimes with a good cup of coffee for the mother, and of <div class="bookquote">``soupe
blanche''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>for the boy; and they went off again into the wide world,
only thinking of, only seeking the <div class="bookquote">``him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>who was everything human
to both. Aimée remembered the sound of the name of the village where
Osborne had often told her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) alighted from the coach to walk
home; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) could never have spelt the strange uncouth word,
yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) spoke it with pretty slow distinctness to the guard, asking
him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) broken English when they should arrive there? Not till
four o'clock. Alas! and what might happen before then! Once with him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) would have no fear; she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) could bring him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) round;
but what might not happen before he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) tender care? She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) was
a very capable person in many ways, though so childish and innocent
in others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) mind to the course she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) should pursue when
the coach set her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) down at Feversham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) asked for a man to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>)
trunk, and show her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) the way to Hamley Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hamley Hall!''  (<font color='red'><b>the innkeeper</b></font>)</div>said the innkeeper. <div class="bookquote">``Eh! there's a deal o' trouble
there just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>), hastening off after the wheelbarrow in
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) trunk was going, and breathlessly struggling to keep up
with it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) heavy child asleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) arms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) pulses beat all over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) body; she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) could hardly see out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) eyes. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>), a foreigner,
the drawn blinds of the house, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) came in sight of it, had no
significance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) hurried, stumbled on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Back door or front, missus?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the boots from the inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The most nearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>). And the front door was <div class="bookquote">``the most
nearest.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Molly was sitting with the Squire in the darkened
drawing-room, reading out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) translations of Aimée's letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
husband. The Squire was never weary of hearing them; the very sound
of Molly's voice soothed and comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), it was so sweet and low.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) up, much as a child does, if on a second reading of
the same letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) substituted one word for another. The house was
very still this afternoon,--still as it had been now for several
days; every servant in it, however needlessly, moving about on
tiptoe, speaking below the breath, and shutting doors as softly
as might be. The nearest noise or stir of active life was that of
the rooks in the trees, who were beginning their spring chatter of
business. Suddenly, through this quiet, there came a ring at the
front-door bell that sounded, and went on sounding, through the
house, pulled by an ignorant vigorous hand. Molly stopped reading;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and the Squire looked at each other in surprised dismay. Perhaps
a thought of Roger's sudden -LRB-and impossible-RRB- return was in the mind
of each; but neither spoke. They heard Robinson hurrying to answer
the unwonted summons. They listened; but they heard no more. There
was little more to hear. When the old servant opened the door,
a lady with a child in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms stood there. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gasped out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
ready-prepared English sentence,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I see Mr. Osborne Hamley? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is ill, I know; but I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Robinson had been aware that there was some mystery, long suspected
by the servants, and come to light at last to the master,--he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had
guessed that there was a young woman in the case; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood
there before him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), asking for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dead husband as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were living,
any presence of mind Robinson might have had forsook him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) could
not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the truth,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) could only leave the door open, and say
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Wait awhile, I'll come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and betake himself to the
drawing-room where Molly was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in a flutter
and a hurry, and whispered something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) which turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) white
with dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it? What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, trembling with excitement.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't keep it from me. I can bear it. Roger--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They both thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was going to faint; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had risen up and come
close to Molly; suspense would be worse than anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Osborne Hamley is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I wrote to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
husband was very ill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) does not know what has happened, seemingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robinson</b></font>)</div>said Robinson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)--I can't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, shrinking away
into a corner. <div class="bookquote">``You will go, Molly, won't you? You'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly stood for a moment or two, irresolute. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), too, shrank from
the interview. Robinson put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) word: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looks but a weakly
thing, and has carried a big baby, choose how far, I didn't stop to
ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robinson</b></font>)</div><p/>At this instant the door softly opened, and right into the midst of
them came the little figure in grey, looking ready to fall with the
weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), not seeing the Squire at once. <div class="bookquote">``The lady
who wrote the letter; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke of you sometimes. You will let me go
to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly did not answer, except that at such moments the eyes speak
solemnly and comprehensively. Aimée read their meaning. All she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said
was,--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is not--oh, my husband--my husband!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms relaxed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
figure swayed, the child screamed and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) arms for help.
That help was given him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grandfather, just before Aimée fell
senseless on the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maman, maman!''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>cried the little fellow, now striving and fighting to
get back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lay; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) fought so lustily that the Squire
had to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) crawled to the poor inanimate body,
behind which sat Molly, holding the head; whilst Robinson rushed away
for water, wine, and more womankind.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``MAMAN, MAMAN!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor thing, poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and
crying afresh over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) suffering. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is but young, Molly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
must ha' loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, quickly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was untying the bonnet, and
taking off the worn, but neatly mended gloves; there was the soft
luxuriant black hair, shading the pale, innocent face,--the little
notable-looking brown hands, with the wedding-ring for sole ornament.
The child clustered his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) fingers round one of hers, and nestled up
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) plaintive cry, getting more and more into a
burst of wailing: <div class="bookquote">``Maman, maman!''  (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>At the growing acuteness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
imploring, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand moved, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lips quivered, consciousness came
partially back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not open her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes, but great heavy tears
stole out from beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyelashes. Molly held her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own breast; and they tried to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wine,--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) shrank
from--water, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not reject; that was all. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
tried to speak. <div class="bookquote">``Take me away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``into the dark. Leave me
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So Molly and the woman lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) up and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) away, and laid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) on the bed, in the best bed-chamber in the house, and darkened
the already shaded light. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was like an unconscious corpse herself,
in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) offered neither assistance nor resistance to all that
they were doing. But just before Molly was leaving the room to take
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) watch outside the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt rather than heard that Aimée
spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Food--bread and milk for baby.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But when they brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) food
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only shrank away and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face to the wall without
a word. In the hurry, the child had been left with Robinson and
the Squire. For some unknown, but most fortunate reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took a
dislike to Robinson's red face and hoarse voice, and showed a most
decided preference for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) grandfather. When Molly came down she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
found the Squire feeding the child, with more of peace upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) face
than there had been for all these days. The boy was every now and
then leaving off taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) bread and milk to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) dislike to
Robinson by word and gesture: a proceeding which only amused the old
servant, while it highly delighted the more favoured Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is lying very still, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) will neither speak nor eat. I don't
even think she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is crying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, volunteering this account, for
the Squire was for the moment too much absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grandson to
ask many questions.

<p/>Robinson put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) word: <div class="bookquote">``Dick Hayward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'s Boots at the Hamley
Arms, says the coach she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) come by started at five this morning from
London, and the passengers said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'d been crying a deal on the road,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought folks were not noticing; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) never came in to
meals with the rest, but stopped feeding her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robinson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'ll be tired out; we must let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``And I
do believe this little chap is going to sleep in my arms. God bless
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>But Molly stole out, and sent off a lad to Hollingford with a note to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart had warmed towards the poor stranger, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
felt uncertain as to what ought to be the course pursued in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) case.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went up from time to time to look at the girl, scarce older than
herself, who lay there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes open, but as motionless as
death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) softly covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) over, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) feel the sympathetic
presence from time to time; and that was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was allowed to do.
The Squire was curiously absorbed in the child, but Molly's supreme
tenderness was for the mother. Not but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) admired the sturdy,
gallant, healthy little fellow, whose every limb, and square inch of
clothing, showed the tender and thrifty care that had been taken of
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). By-and-by the Squire said in a whisper,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s not like a Frenchwoman, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I don't know what Frenchwomen are like. People say
Cynthia is French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) didn't look like a servant? We won't speak of Cynthia since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s served my Roger so. Why, I began to think, as soon as I could
think after _that_, how I would make Roger and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) happy, and have
them married at once; and then came that letter! I never wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
for a daughter-in-law, not I. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did, it seems; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wasn't one
for wanting many things for himself. But it's all over now; only we
won't talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); and maybe, as you say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was more French than
English. This poor thing looks like a gentlewoman, I think. I hope
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s got friends who'll take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>),--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) can't be above
twenty. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) must be older than my poor lad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s a gentle, pretty creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``But--but I sometimes
think it has killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) lies like one dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>And Molly could not
keep from crying softly at the thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire. <div class="bookquote">``It's not so easy to break one's heart.
Sometimes I've wished it were. But one has to go on living--`all
the appointed days,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as it says in the Bible. But we'll do our best
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). We'll not think of letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) go away till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s fit to
travel.''

<p/>Molly wondered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart about this going away, on which the
Squire seemed fully resolved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) intended to keep
the child; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had a legal right to do so;--but would the
mother ever part from it? Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father, however, would solve the
difficulty,--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always looked to as so clear-seeing
and experienced. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) watched and waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) coming. The February
evening drew on; the child lay asleep in the Squire's arms till his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
grandfather grew tired, and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) down on the sofa: the large
square-cornered yellow sofa upon which Mrs. Hamley used to sit,
supported by pillows in a half-reclining position. Since her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) time it
had been placed against the wall, and had served merely as a piece
of furniture to fill up the room. But once again a human figure was
lying upon it; a little human creature, like a cherub in some old
Italian picture. The Squire remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) put the child
down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said to Molly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How pleased she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) would have been!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>But Molly thought of the poor
young widow upstairs. Aimée was her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>Aimée</b></font>)</div>at the first moment.
Presently,--but it seemed a long long time first,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard the
quick prompt sounds which told of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's arrival. In he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
came--to the room as yet only lighted by the fitful blaze of the
fire.




<p/>CHAPTER LIV.

<p/>MOLLY GIBSON``S WORTH IS DISCOVERED.


<p/>Mr. Gibson came in rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hands after his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) frosty ride. Molly
judged from the look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eye that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been fully informed of
the present state of things at the Hall by some one. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) simply
went up to and greeted the Squire, and waited to hear what was said
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). The Squire was fumbling at the taper on the writing-table,
and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) answered much he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) lighted it, and signing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) friend
to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) went softly to the sofa and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) the sleeping
child, taking the utmost care not to arouse it by flare or sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! this is a fine young gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, returning
to the fire rather sooner than the Squire expected. <div class="bookquote">``And you've got
the mother here, I understand. Mrs. Osborne Hamley, as we must call
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), poor thing! It's a sad coming home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>); for I hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) knew
nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) death.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) spoke without exactly addressing any one,
so that either Molly or the Squire might answer as they liked. The
Squire said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s felt it a terrible shock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s upstairs in the best
bedroom. I should like you to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), Gibson, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'ll let you. We
must do our duty by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), for my poor lad's sake. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could have
seen his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) boy lying there; I do. I daresay it preyed on him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to have to
keep it all to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) might ha' known me, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) might ha'
known my bark was waur than my bite. It's all over now, though; and
God forgive me if I was too sharp. I'm punished now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly grew impatient on the mother's behalf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, I feel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was very ill; perhaps worse than we think.
Will you go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) upstairs, and the Squire came too,
thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) duty now, and even feeling some
self-satisfaction at conquering his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) desire to stay with the child.
They went into the room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been taken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lay quite still
in the same position as at first. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes were open and tearless,
fixed on the wall. Mr. Gibson spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not answer;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pulse; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) never noticed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring me some wine at once, and order some beef-tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said to
Molly.

<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) tried to put the wine into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mouth as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lay there on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made no effort to receive or swallow it, and it ran out
upon the pillow. Mr. Gibson left the room abruptly; Molly chafed the
little inanimate hand; the Squire stood by in dumb dismay, touched in
spite of himself by the death-in-life of one so young, and who must
have been so much beloved.

<p/>Mr. Gibson came back two steps at a time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was carrying the
half-awakened child in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not scruple to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) into
yet further wakefulness--did not grieve to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) begin to wail and
cry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) eyes were on the figure upon the bed, which at that sound
quivered all through; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) child was laid at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) back, and
began caressingly to scramble yet closer, Aimée turned round, and
took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arms, and lulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) and soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with the soft
wont of mother's love.

<p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lost this faint consciousness, which was habit or instinct
rather than thought, Mr. Gibson spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in French. The child's
one word of <div class="bookquote">``maman''  (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) this clue. It was the language
sure to be most intelligible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) dulled brain; and as it
happened,--only Mr. Gibson did not think of that--it was the language
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been commanded, and had learnt to obey.

<p/>Mr. Gibson's tongue was a little stiff at first, but by-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
spoke it with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) old readiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) extorted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) short
answers at first, then longer ones, and from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) plied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) with little drops of wine, until some further nourishment should
be at hand. Molly was struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's low tones of comfort and
sympathy, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not follow what was said quickly enough
to catch the meaning of what passed.

<p/>By-and-by, however, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father had done all that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could, and
they were once more downstairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told them more about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) journey
than they yet knew. The hurry, the sense of acting in defiance of
a prohibition, the over-mastering anxiety, the broken night, and
fatigue of the journey, had ill prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for the shock at last,
and Mr. Gibson was seriously alarmed for the consequences. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
wandered strangely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) replies to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was wandering, and had made great efforts to recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) senses;
but Mr. Gibson foresaw that some bodily illness was coming on,
and stopped late that night, arranging many things with Molly and
the Squire. One--the only--comfort arising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) state was the
probability that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would be entirely unconscious by the morrow--the
day of the funeral. Worn out by the contending emotions of the day,
the Squire seemed now unable to look beyond the wrench and trial of
the next twelve hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sate with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands, declining
to go to bed, refusing to dwell on the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grandchild--not
three hours ago such a darling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eyes. Mr. Gibson gave some
instructions to one of the maid-servants as to the watch she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was to
keep by Mrs. Osborne Hamley, and insisted on Molly's going to bed.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pleaded the apparent necessity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) staying up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Molly, look how much less trouble the dear old Squire would
give if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would obey orders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is only adding to anxiety by
indulging himself. One pardons everything to extreme grief, however.
But you will have enough to do to occupy all your strength for days
to come; and go to bed you must now. I only wish I saw my way as
clearly through other things as I do to your nearest duty. I wish I'd
never let Roger go wandering off; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll wish it too, poor fellow!
Did I tell you Cynthia is going off in hot haste to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) uncle
Kirkpatrick's? I suspect a visit to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will stand in lieu of going
out to Russia as a governess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was quite serious in wishing for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes! at the time. I've no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was sincere
in intending to go. But the great thing was to get out of the
unpleasantness of the present time and place; and uncle Kirkpatrick's
will do this as effectually, and more pleasantly, than a situation at
Nishni-Novgorod in an ice-palace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had given Molly's thoughts a turn, which was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wanted to
do. Molly could not help remembering Mr. Henderson, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) offer,
and all the consequent hints; and wondering, and wishing--what did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wish? or had she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) been falling asleep? Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had quite
ascertained this point she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was asleep in reality.

<p/>After this, long days passed over in a monotonous round of care; for
no one seemed to think of Molly's leaving the Hall during the woeful
illness that befell Mrs. Osborne Hamley. It was not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to take much active part in the nursing; the Squire gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) _carte-blanche_, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) engaged two efficient hospital nurses to
watch over the unconscious Aimée; but Molly was needed to receive the
finer directions as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) treatment and diet. It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
was wanted for the care of the little boy; the Squire was too jealous
of the child's exclusive love for that, and one of the housemaids was
employed in the actual physical charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) needed some one
to listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) incontinence of language, both when his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) passionate
regret for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) dead son came uppermost, and also when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had
discovered some extraordinary charm in that son's child; and again
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was oppressed with the uncertainty of Aimée's long-continued
illness. Molly was not so good or so bewitching a listener to
ordinary conversation as Cynthia; but where her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) heart was interested
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sympathy was deep and unfailing. In this case she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) only wished
that the Squire could really feel that Aimée was not the encumbrance
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) evidently considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to be. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would have
acknowledged the fact, if it had been put before him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in plain words.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) fought against the dim consciousness of what was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
spoke repeatedly of patience when no one but himself was impatient;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would often say that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) grew better she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) must not be allowed
to leave the Hall until she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was perfectly strong, when no one was
even contemplating the remotest chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) child,
excepting only himself. Molly once or twice asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
might not speak to the Squire, and represent the hardship of sending
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) away--the improbability that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would consent to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) boy,
and so on; but Mr. Gibson only replied,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait quietly. Time enough when nature and circumstance have had
their chance, and have failed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>It was well that Molly was such a favourite with the old servants;
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had frequently to restrain and to control. To be sure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's authority to back her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and they were aware that
where her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own comfort, ease, or pleasure was concerned she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) never
interfered, but submitted to their will. If the Squire had known of
the want of attendance to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) submitted with the most perfect
meekness, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) herself was the only sufferer, he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) would have
gone into a towering rage. But Molly hardly thought of it, so anxious
was she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to do all she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could for others, and to remember the various
charges which her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daily visits. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
did not spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) enough; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was willing and uncomplaining; but one
day after Mrs. Osborne Hamley had <div class="bookquote">``taken the turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Osborne/Mrs. Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>as the nurses
called it, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was lying weak as a new-born baby, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
faculties all restored, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) fever gone,--when spring buds were
blooming out, and spring birds sang merrily,--Molly answered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father's sudden questioning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt unaccountably weary; that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head ached heavily, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was aware of a sluggishness of
thought which it required a painful effort to overcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, with a quick pang of anxiety, almost
of remorse. <div class="bookquote">``Lie down here--with your back to the light. I'll come
back and see you before I go.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And off he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went in search of the
Squire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had a good long walk before he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) came upon Mr. Hamley in
a field of spring wheat, where the women were weeding, his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) little
grandson holding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) finger in the intervals of short walks of
inquiry into the dirtiest places, which was all his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sturdy little
limbs could manage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Gibson, and how goes the patient? Better? I wish we could
get her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) out of doors, such a fine day as it is. It would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
strong as soon as anything. I used to beg my poor lad to come out
more. Maybe, I worried him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>); but the air is the finest thing for
strengthening that I know of. Though, perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'ll not thrive in
English air as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'d been born here; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'ll not be quite right
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) gets back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) native place, wherever that is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I begin to think we shall get her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) quite round here;
and I don't know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could be in a better place. But it's not
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). May I order the carriage for my Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gibson's voice
sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was choking a little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said these last words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, setting the child down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had been
holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) arms the last few minutes: but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wanted all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eyes to look into Mr. Gibson's face. <div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), catching
hold of Mr. Gibson's arm, <div class="bookquote">``what's the matter, man? Don't twitch up
your face like that, but speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing's the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, hastily. <div class="bookquote">``Only I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at
home, under my own eye;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) turned away to go to the house. But
the Squire left his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) field and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) weeders, and kept at Mr. Gibson's
side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wanted to speak, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart was so full he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not know
what to say. <div class="bookquote">``I say, Gibson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) got out at last, <div class="bookquote">``your Molly is
liker a child of mine than a stranger; and I reckon we've all on us
been coming too hard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). You don't think there's much amiss, do
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I tell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, almost savagely. But any hastiness
of temper was instinctively understood by the Squire; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was not
offended, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not speak again till they reached the house.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) went to order the carriage, and stood by sorrowful enough
while the horses were being put in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) should not know
what to do without Molly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had never known her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) value, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) thought,
till now. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) kept silence on this view of the case; which was a
praiseworthy effort on the part of one who usually let by-standers
see and hear as much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) passing feelings as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had had a
window in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) breast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) stood by while Mr. Gibson helped the
faintly-smiling, tearful Molly into the carriage. Then the Squire
mounted on the step and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) tried to thank
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) broke down; and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) was once more
safely on the ground, Mr. Gibson cried out to the coachman to drive
on. And so Molly left Hamley Hall. From time to time her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father
rode up to the window, and made some little cheerful and apparently
careless remark. When they came within two miles of Hollingford, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
put spurs to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) horse, and rode briskly past the carriage windows,
kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand to the occupant as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did so. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on to prepare
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) home for Molly: when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) arrived Mrs. Gibson was ready to greet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). Mr. Gibson had given one or two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) bright, imperative
orders, and Mrs. Gibson was feeling rather lonely <div class="bookquote">``without either of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) two dear girls at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) phrased it, to herself as well as
to others.

<p/>``Why, my sweet Molly, this is an unexpected pleasure. Only this
morning I said to papa, ``When do you think we shall see our Molly
back?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not say much--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) never does, you know; but I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
thought directly of giving me this surprise, this pleasure. You're
looking a little--what shall I call it? I remember such a pretty line
of poetry, ``Oh, call her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fair, not pale!<div class="bookquote">''--so we'll call you fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better not call her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) anything, but let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) get to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own room
and have a good rest as soon as possible. Haven't you got a trashy
novel or two in the house? That's the literature to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to
sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) laid on a sofa in a
darkened room, with some slight pretence of reading in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came away, leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife, who turned round at the door to kiss
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand to Molly, and make a little face of unwillingness to be
dragged away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Hyacinth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife into the drawing-room,
<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) will need much care. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) has been overworked, and I've been a
fool. That's all. We must keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) from all worry and care,--but I
won't answer for it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>)'ll not have an illness, for all that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor thing! she (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) does look worn out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) is something like me, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>)
feelings are too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>). But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) is come home she (<font color='blue'><b>Hyacinth</b></font>) shall
find us as cheerful as possible. I can answer for myself; and you
really must brighten up your doleful face, my dear--nothing so
bad for invalids as the appearance of depression in those around
them. I have had such a pleasant letter from Cynthia to-day. Uncle
Kirkpatrick really seems to make so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) just
like a daughter; he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) a ticket to the Concerts of Ancient
Music; and Mr. Henderson has been to call on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), in spite of all
that has gone before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant, Mr. Gibson thought that it was easy enough for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife to be cheerful, with the pleasant thoughts and evident
anticipations she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind, but a little more difficult for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) doleful looks while his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own child lay in a state
of suffering and illness which might be the precursor of a still
worse malady. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was always a man for immediate action as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had resolved on the course to be taken; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew that <div class="bookquote">``some
must watch, while some must sleep; so runs the world away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The illness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) apprehended came upon Molly; not violently or
acutely, so that there was any immediate danger to be dreaded; but
making a long pull upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) strength, which seemed to lessen day
by day, until at last her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might become a
permanent invalid. There was nothing very decided or alarming to tell
Cynthia, and Mrs. Gibson kept the dark side from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) letters.
<div class="bookquote">``Molly was feeling the spring weather;''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Molly had been a good
deal overdone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stay at the Hall, and was resting;''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>such
little sentences told nothing of Molly's real state. But then, as
Mrs. Gibson said to herself, it would be a pity to disturb Cynthia's
pleasure by telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) much about Molly; indeed, there was not much
to tell, one day was so like another. But it so happened that Lady
Harriet,--who came whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could to sit awhile with Molly,
at first against Mrs. Gibson's will, and afterwards with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) full
consent,--for reasons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) own, Lady Harriet wrote a letter to
Cynthia, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was urged by Mrs. Gibson. It fell out in this
manner:--One day, when Lady Harriet was sitting in the drawing-room
for a few minutes after she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been with Molly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Clare, I spend so much time in your house that I'm going
to establish a work-basket here. Mary has infected me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
notability, and I'm going to work mamma a footstool. It is to be
a surprise; and so if I do it here she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will know nothing about it.
Only I cannot match the gold beads I want for the pansies in this
dear little town; and Hollingford, who could send me down stars and
planets if I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), I make no doubt, could no more match beads
than--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Harriet! you forget Cynthia! Think what a pleasure it
would be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to do anything for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) shall have plenty of it; but mind, it is you who
have answered for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) shall get me some wool too; how good I am
to confer so much pleasure on a fellow-creature! But seriously, do
you think I might write and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) a few commissions? Neither Agnes
nor Mary are in town--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) would be delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, who also took
into consideration the reflection of aristocratic honour that would
fall upon Cynthia if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had a letter from Lady Harriet while at
Mr. Kirkpatrick's. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) gave the address, and Lady Harriet wrote.
All the first part of the letter was taken up with apology and
commissions; but then, never doubting but that Cynthia was aware of
Molly's state, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) went on to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw Molly this morning. Twice I have been forbidden admittance, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was too ill to see any one out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own family. I wish we could
begin to perceive a change for the better; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looks more fading
every time, and I fear Mr. Gibson considers it a very anxious case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The day but one after this letter was despatched, Cynthia walked into
the drawing-room at home with as much apparent composure as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
had left it not an hour before. Mrs. Gibson was dozing, but believing
herself to be reading; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been with Molly the greater part of
the morning, and now after her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lunch, and the invalid's pretence of
early dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) considered herself entitled to some repose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
started up as Cynthia came in:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cynthia! Dear child, where have you come from? Why in the world have
you come? My poor nerves! My heart is quite fluttering; but, to be
sure, it's no wonder with all this anxiety I have to undergo. Why
have you come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because of the anxiety you speak of, mamma. I never knew,--you never
told me how ill Molly was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! I beg your pardon, my dear, but it's really nonsense.
Molly's illness is only nervous, Mr. Gibson says. A nervous fever;
but you must remember nerves are mere fancy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s getting
better. Such a pity for you to have left your uncle's. Who told you
about Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Harriet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wrote about some wool--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,--I know. But you might have known she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) always exaggerates
things. Not but what I have been almost worn out with nursing.
Perhaps, after all, it is a very good thing you have come, my dear;
and now you shall come down into the dining-room and have some lunch,
and tell me all the Hyde Park Street news--into my room,--don't go
into yours yet--Molly is so sensitive to noise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>While Cynthia ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) lunch, Mrs. Gibson went on questioning. <div class="bookquote">``And
your aunt, how is her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cold? And Helen, quite strong again? Margaretta
as pretty as ever? The boys are at Harrow, I suppose? And my old
favourite, Mr. Henderson?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could not manage to slip in this last
inquiry naturally; in spite of herself there was a change of tone, an
accent of eagerness. Cynthia did not reply on the instant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) poured
herself out some water with great deliberation, and then said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My aunt is quite well; Helen is as strong as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) ever is, and
Margaretta very pretty. The boys are at Harrow, and I conclude that
Mr. Henderson is enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) usual health, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was to dine at my
uncle's to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Cynthia. Look how you are cutting that gooseberry tart,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, with sharp annoyance; not provoked by Cynthia's
present action, although it gave excuse for a little vent of temper.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't think how you could come off in this sudden kind of way; I
am sure it must have annoyed your uncle and aunt. I daresay they'll
never ask you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I am to go back there as soon as ever I can be easy
to leave Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Easy to leave Molly.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Now that really is nonsense, and rather
uncomplimentary to me, I must say: nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as I have been doing,
daily, and almost nightly; for I have been wakened times out of
number by Mr. Gibson getting up, and going to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
medicine properly.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has been very ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has, in one way; but not in another. It was what I call
more a tedious, than an interesting illness. There was no immediate
danger, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lay much in the same state from day to day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had known!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>sighed Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I might go and
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go and prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). You'll find her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a good deal better than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) has been. Ah; here's Mr. Gibson!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) came into the dining-room,
hearing voices. Cynthia thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) looked much older.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), coming forward to shake hands. <div class="bookquote">``Why, how did you
come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Umpire</b></font>)</div><p/>``By the ``Umpire.<div class="bookquote">'' I never knew Molly had been so ill, or I would have
come directly.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Umpire</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes were full of tears. Mr. Gibson was touched;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hand again, and murmured, <div class="bookquote">``You're a good girl, Cynthia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s heard one of dear Lady Harriet's exaggerated accounts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Gibson, <div class="bookquote">``and come straight off. I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) it's very foolish,
for Molly is a great deal better now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very foolish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, echoing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife's words, but
smiling at Cynthia. <div class="bookquote">``But sometimes one likes foolish people for their
folly, better than wise people for their wisdom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid folly always annoys me,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``However,
Cynthia is here, and what is done, is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, my dear. And now I'll run up and see my little girl,
and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the good news. You'd better follow me in a couple of
minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>This to Cynthia.

<p/>Molly's delight at seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) showed itself first in a few happy
tears; and then in soft caresses and inarticulate sounds of love.
Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``It is such a pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
stopped short. But the eloquence of these five words sank deep into
Cynthia's heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had returned just at the right time, when Molly
wanted the gentle fillip of the society of a fresh and yet a familiar
person. Cynthia's tact made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) talkative or silent, gay or grave,
as the varying humour of Molly required. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) listened, too, with the
semblance, if not the reality, of unwearied interest, to Molly's
continual recurrence to all the time of distress and sorrow at Hamley
Hall, and to the scenes which had then so deeply impressed themselves
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) susceptible nature. Cynthia instinctively knew that the
repetition of all these painful recollections would ease the
oppressed memory, which refused to dwell on anything but what had
occurred at a time of feverish disturbance of health. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) never
interrupted Molly, as Mrs. Gibson had so frequently done, with--<div class="bookquote">``You
told me all that before, my dear. Let us talk of something else;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>or,
<div class="bookquote">``Really I cannot allow you to be always dwelling on painful thoughts.
Try and be a little more cheerful. Youth is gay. You are young,
and therefore you ought to be gay. That is put in a famous form of
speech; I forget exactly what it is called.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So Molly's health and spirits improved rapidly after Cynthia's
return: and although she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was likely to retain many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) invalid
habits during the summer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was able to take drives, and enjoy the
fine weather; it was only her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) as yet tender spirits that required a
little management. All the Hollingford people forgot that they had
ever thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) except as a darling of the town; and each in his (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>)
or her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) way showed kind interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) father's child. Miss Browning
and Miss Phoebe considered it quite a privilege that they were
allowed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) a fortnight or three weeks before any one else;
Mrs. Goodenough, spectacles on nose, stirred dainty messes in a
silver saucepan for Molly's benefit; the Towers sent books, and
forced fruit, and new caricatures, and strange and delicate poultry;
humble patients of <div class="bookquote">``the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>patients</b></font>)</div>as Mr. Gibson was usually termed,
left the earliest cauliflowers they could grow in their cottage
gardens, with <div class="bookquote">``their duty for Miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>And last of all, though strongest in regard, most piteously eager in
interest, came Squire Hamley himself. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was at the worst, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
rode over every day to hear the smallest detail, facing even Mrs.
Gibson -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) abomination-RRB- if her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband was not at home, to ask and
hear, and ask and hear, till the tears were unconsciously stealing
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) cheeks. Every resource of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) heart, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) house, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
lands was searched and tried, if it could bring a moment's pleasure
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>); and whatever it might be that came from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) very
worst time, it brought out a dim smile upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) face.




<p/>CHAPTER LV.

<p/>AN ABSENT LOVER RETURNS.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration -LRB-untitled-RRB--RSB-

<p/>And now it was late June; and to Molly's and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's extreme
urgency in pushing, and Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick's affectionate
persistency in pulling, Cynthia had yielded, and had gone back to
finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) interrupted visit in London, but not before the bruit of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) previous sudden return to nurse Molly had told strongly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
favour in the fluctuating opinion of the little town. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) affair with
Mr. Preston was thrust into the shade; while every one was speaking
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) warm heart. Under the gleam of Molly's recovery everything
assumed a rosy hue, as indeed became the time when actual roses were
fully in bloom.

<p/>One morning Mrs. Gibson brought Molly a great basket of flowers, that
had been sent from the Hall. Molly still breakfasted in bed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had just come down, and was now well enough to arrange the flowers
for the drawing-room, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did so with these blossoms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made
some comments on each.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! these white pinks! They were Mrs. Hamley's favourite flower;
and so like her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)! This little bit of sweet briar, it quite scents the
room. It has pricked my fingers, but never mind. Oh, mamma, look
at this rose! I forget its name, but it is very rare, and grows up
in the sheltered corner of the wall, near the mulberry-tree. Roger
bought the tree for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own money when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was quite a
boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) showed it me, and made me notice it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daresay it was Roger who got it now. You heard papa say he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Roger! Roger come home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, turning first red, then
very white.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Oh, I remember you had gone to bed before papa came in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
was called off early to tiresome Mrs. Beale. Yes, Roger turned up at
the Hall the day before yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>But Molly leaned back against her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) chair, too faint to do more at the
flowers for some time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had been startled by the suddenness of the
news. <div class="bookquote">``Roger come home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>It happened that Mr. Gibson was unusually busy on this particular
day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not come home till late in the afternoon. But Molly
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) place in the drawing-room all the time, not even going to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) customary siesta, so anxious was she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to hear everything
about Roger's return, which as yet appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) almost incredible.
But it was quite natural in reality; the long monotony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) illness
had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lose all count of time. When Roger left England, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
idea was to coast round Africa on the eastern side until he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) reached
the Cape; and thence to make what further journey or voyage might
seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) best in pursuit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) scientific objects. To Cape Town
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) letters had been addressed of late; and there, two months
before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had received the intelligence of Osborne's death, as well
as Cynthia's hasty letter of relinquishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not consider
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was doing wrong in returning to England immediately, and
reporting himself to the gentlemen who had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) out, with a
full explanation of the circumstances relating to Osborne's private
marriage and sudden death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) offered, and they accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) offer,
to go out again for any time that they might think equivalent to the
five months he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was yet engaged to them for. They were most of them
gentlemen of property, and saw the full importance of proving the
marriage of an eldest son, and installing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) child as the natural
heir to a long-descended estate. This much information, but in a more
condensed form, Mr. Gibson gave to Molly, in a very few minutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
sat up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sofa, looking very pretty with the flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cheeks,
and the brightness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), when her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father stopped speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), playfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! why, such a number of things. I've been waiting all day to ask
you all about everything. How is he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) looking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If a young man of twenty-four ever does take to growing taller, I
should say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was taller. As it is, I suppose it's only that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looks broader, stronger--more muscular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) changed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, a little disturbed by this account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not changed; and yet not the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s as brown as a berry for
one thing; caught a little of the negro tinge, and a beard as fine
and sweeping as my bay-mare's tail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A beard! But go on, papa. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) talk as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) used to do? I should
know his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) voice amongst ten thousand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I didn't catch any Hottentot twang, if that's what you mean. Nor did
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) say, ``Cæsar and Pompey berry much alike, `specially Pompey,<div class="bookquote">'' which
is the only specimen of negro language I can remember just at this
moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pompey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And which I never could see the wit of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, who had
come into the room after the conversation had begun; and did not
understand what it was aiming at. Molly fidgeted; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wanted to go on
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) questions and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father to definite and matter-of-fact
answers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew that when his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife chimed into a conversation,
Mr. Gibson was very apt to find out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) must go about some
necessary piece of business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, how are they all getting on together?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was an inquiry
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did not make in general before Mrs. Gibson, for Molly and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father had tacitly agreed to keep silence on what they knew or
had observed, respecting the three who formed the present family at
the Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, <div class="bookquote">``Roger is evidently putting everything to
rights in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) firm, quiet way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Things to rights.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>Why, what's wrong?'' asked Mrs. Gibson quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``The Squire and the French daughter-in-law don't get on well
together, I suppose? I am always so glad Cynthia acted with the
promptitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did; it would have been very awkward for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to have
been mixed up with all these complications. Poor Roger! to find
himself supplanted by a child when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) comes home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were not in the room, my dear, when I was telling Molly of the
reasons for Roger's return; it was to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother's child at once
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) rightful and legal place. So now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) finds the work
partly done to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is happy and gratified in proportion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is not much affected by Cynthia's breaking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
engagement?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mrs. Gibson could afford to call it an <div class="bookquote">``engagement''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>now.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I never did give him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) credit for very deep feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) feels it very acutely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and I had a long talk
about it, yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Both Molly and Mrs. Gibson would have liked to have heard something
more about this conversation; but Mr. Gibson did not choose to go on
with the subject. The only point which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) disclosed was that Roger
had insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) right to have a personal interview with Cynthia;
and, on hearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was in London at present, had deferred any
further explanation or expostulation by letter, preferring to await
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) return.

<p/>Molly went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) questions on other subjects. <div class="bookquote">``And Mrs. Osborne
Hamley? How is she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonderfully brightened up by Roger's presence. I don't think I've
ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) smile before; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the sweetest smiles
from time to time. They are evidently good friends; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) loses her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
strange startled look when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) speaks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). I suspect she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has been
quite aware of the Squire's wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) should return to France;
and has been hard put to it to decide whether to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) child or
not. The idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) would have to make some such decision came
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was completely shattered by grief and illness, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) hasn't had any one to consult as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) duty until Roger came,
upon whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has evidently firm reliance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) told me something of
this himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to have had quite a long conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I was going to see old Abraham, when the Squire called to me
over the hedge, as I was jogging along. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) told me the news; and
there was no resisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) invitation to come back and lunch with
them. Besides, one gets a great deal of meaning out of Roger's words;
it didn't take so very long a time to hear this much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would come and call upon us soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gibson to Molly, <div class="bookquote">``and then we shall see how much we can manage to
hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, more doubtfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
remembered the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was in that very room, and the hopes with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) left it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could see traces of this
thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) father's countenance at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife's speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell, my dear. Until he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s quite convinced of Cynthia's
intentions, it can't be very pleasant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to come on mere visits
of ceremony to the house in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has known her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s one who
will always do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thinks right, whether pleasant or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gibson could hardly wait till her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) husband had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
sentence before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) testified against a part of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Convinced of Cynthia's intentions!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I should think she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had made
them pretty clear! What more does the man want?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s not as yet convinced that the letter wasn't written in a fit
of temporary feeling. I've told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that this was true; although I
didn't feel it my place to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the causes of that feeling.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) can induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to resume the former footing.
I don't; and I've told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) so; but, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) needs the full
conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) alone can give him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Cynthia! My poor child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, plaintively. <div class="bookquote">``What
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) has exposed herself to by letting herself be over-persuaded by
that man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson's eyes flashed fire. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) lips tight closed;
and only said, <div class="bookquote">''`That man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>indeed!'' quite below his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath.

<p/>Molly, too, had been damped by an expression or two in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's
speech. <div class="bookquote">``Mere visits of ceremony!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Was it so, indeed? A <div class="bookquote">``mere visit
of ceremony!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Whatever it was, the call was paid before many days
were over. That he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt all the awkwardness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) position towards
Mrs. Gibson--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in reality suffering pain all the time--was
but too evident to Molly; but, of course, Mrs. Gibson saw nothing
of this in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) gratification at the proper respect paid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) by
one whose name was in the newspapers that chronicled his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) return, and
about whom already Lord Cumnor and the Towers family had been making
inquiry.

<p/>Molly was sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) pretty white invalid's dress, half reading,
half dreaming, for the June air was so clear and ambient, the garden
so full of bloom, the trees so full of leaf, that reading by the open
window was only a pretence at such a time; besides which, Mrs. Gibson
continually interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) with remarks about the pattern of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
worsted work. It was after lunch--orthodox calling time, when Maria
ushered in Mr. Roger Hamley. Molly started up; and then stood shyly
and quietly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) place while a bronzed, bearded, grave man came
into the room, in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at first had to seek for the merry boyish
face she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew by heart only two years ago. But months in the climates
in which Roger had been travelling age as much as years in more
temperate regions. And constant thought and anxiety while in daily
peril of life deepen the lines of character upon the face. Moreover,
the circumstances that had of late affected him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) personally were not
of a nature to make him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) either buoyant or cheerful. But his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) voice was
the same; that was the first point of the old friend Molly caught,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in a tone far softer than he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) used in speaking
conventional politenesses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was so sorry to hear how ill you had been! You are looking but
delicate!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>letting his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eyes rest upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face with affectionate
examination. Molly felt herself colour all over with the
consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) regard. To do something to put an end to it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked up, and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) beautiful soft grey eyes, which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
never remembered to have noticed before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
blushed still deeper, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I am quite strong now to what I was. It would be a shame to be
ill when everything is in its full summer beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard how deeply we--I am indebted to you--my father can
hardly praise you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, the tears coming into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes in spite
of herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) seemed to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at once; he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) went on as if
speaking to Mrs. Gibson: <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my little sister-in-law is never
weary of talking about Monsieur le Docteur, as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) calls your
husband!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not had the pleasure of making Mrs. Osborne Hamley's
acquaintance yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, suddenly aware of a duty which
might have been expected from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I must beg you to apologize
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) for my remissness. But Molly has been such a care and anxiety
to me--for, you know, I look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) quite as my own child--that
I really have not gone anywhere; excepting to the Towers, perhaps
I should say, which is just like another home to me. And then I
understood that Mrs. Osborne Hamley was thinking of returning to
France before long? Still it was very remiss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The little trap thus set for news of what might be going on in the
Hamley family was quite successful. Roger answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) thus:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure Mrs. Osborne Hamley will be very glad to see any friends
of the family, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is a little stronger. I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) will
not go back to France at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is an orphan, and I trust we shall
induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to remain with my father. But at present nothing is
arranged.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>Then, as if glad to have got over his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``visit of ceremony,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) got up and took leave. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was at the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) looked back,
having, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thought, a word more to say; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) quite forgot what
it was, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) surprised Molly's intent gaze, and sudden confusion at
discovery, and went away as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Osborne was right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) has grown into delicate
fragrant beauty, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) would: or is it the character
which has formed her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) face? Now the next time I enter these doors, it
will be to learn my fate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife of Roger's desire to have a personal
interview with Cynthia, rather with a view to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) repeating what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not see any exact necessity for this, it
is true; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought it might be advisable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) should know
all the truth in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was concerned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife this.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) took the affair into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own management, and, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
apparently agreed with Mr. Gibson, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) never named the affair to
Cynthia; all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was--

<p/>``Your old admirer, Roger Hamley, has come home in a great hurry,
in consequence of poor dear Osborne's unexpected decease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) must
have been rather surprised to find the widow and her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) little boy
established at the Hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) came to call here the other day, and
made himself really rather agreeable, although his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) manners are not
improved by the society he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has kept on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) travels. Still I prophesy
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) will be considered as a fashionable ``lion,<div class="bookquote">'' and perhaps the very
uncouthness which jars against my sense of refinement, may even
become admired in a scientific traveller, who has been into more
desert places, and eaten more extraordinary food, than any other
Englishman of the day. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) has given up all chance of
inheriting the estate, for I hear he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) talks of returning to Africa,
and becoming a regular wanderer. Your name was not mentioned, but I
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) inquired about you from Mr. Gibson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) folded up and directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
letter; <div class="bookquote">``that can't disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), or make her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) uncomfortable. And it's
all the truth too, or very near it. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'ll want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
when she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) comes back; but by that time I do hope Mr. Henderson will
have proposed again, and that that affair will be all settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Cynthia returned to Hollingford one Tuesday morning, and in
answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother's anxious inquiries on the subject, would only
say that Mr. Henderson had not offered again. <div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had
refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) did not know the reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) refusal, at
least one of the reasons. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) did not know if she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) should have taken
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) if there had been no such person as Roger Hamley in the world.
No! Uncle and aunt Kirkpatrick had never heard anything about Roger's
offer,--nor had her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) cousins. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had always declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) wish to
keep it a secret, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had not mentioned it to any one, whatever
other people might have done.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Underneath this light and careless
vein there were other feelings; but Mrs. Gibson was not one to
probe beneath the surface. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) heart on Mr. Henderson's
marrying Cynthia very early in their acquaintance; and to know,
firstly, that the same wish had entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) head, and that
Roger's attachment to Cynthia, with its consequences, had been
the obstacle; and secondly, that Cynthia herself with all the
opportunities of propinquity which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had lately had, had failed to
provoke a repetition of the offer,--was, as Mrs. Gibson said, <div class="bookquote">``enough
to provoke a saint.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>All the rest of the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) alluded to Cynthia
as a disappointing and ungrateful daughter; Molly could not make out
why, and resented it for Cynthia, until the latter said, bitterly,
<div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Molly. Mamma is only vexed because Mr.--because I have
not come back an engaged young lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and I am sure you might have done,--there's the ingratitude! I
am not so unjust as to want you to do what you can't do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gibson, querulously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where's the ingratitude, mamma? I'm very much tired, and perhaps
that makes me stupid; but I cannot see the ingratitude.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia
spoke very wearily, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) head back on the sofa-cushions, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did not care to have an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, don't you see we are doing all we can for you; dressing you
well, and sending you to London; and when you might relieve us of the
expense of all this, you don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Cynthia, I will speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, all crimson with
indignation, and pushing away Cynthia's restraining hand. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure
papa does not feel, and does not mind, any expense he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) incurs about
his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) daughters. And I know quite well that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) does not wish us to
marry, unless--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) faltered and stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, half-mocking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless we love some one very dearly indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in a low,
firm tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, after this tirade--really rather indelicate, I must say--I
have done. I will neither help nor hinder any love-affairs of you two
young ladies. In my days we were glad of the advice of our elders.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) left the room to put into fulfilment an idea which had just
struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>): to write a confidential letter to Mrs. Kirkpatrick,
giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) version of Cynthia's <div class="bookquote">``unfortunate entanglement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>and
<div class="bookquote">``delicate sense of honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>and hints of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) entire indifference
to all the masculine portion of the world, Mr. Henderson being
dexterously excluded from the category.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, throwing herself back in a chair, with a sigh
of relief, as Mrs. Gibson left the room; <div class="bookquote">``how cross I do get since
I've been ill! But I couldn't bear her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to speak as if papa grudged
you anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) doesn't, Molly. You need not defend him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) on my account.
But I'm sorry mamma still looks upon me as `an encumbrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>as the
advertisements in _The Times_ always call us unfortunate children.
But I've been an encumbrance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) all my life. I'm getting very
much into despair about everything, Molly. I shall try my luck in
Russia. I've heard of a situation as English governess at Moscow, in
a family owning whole provinces of land, and serfs by the hundred. I
put off writing my letter till I came home; I shall be as much out
of the way there as if I was married. Oh, dear! travelling all night
isn't good for the spirits. How is Mr. Preston?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has taken Cumnor Grange, three miles away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) never comes
in to the Hollingford tea-parties now. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) once in the street,
but it's a question which of us tried the hardest to get out of the
other's way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not said anything about Roger, yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I didn't know if you would care to hear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is very much
older-looking; quite a strong grown-up man. And papa says he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is much
graver. Ask me any questions, if you want to know, but I have only
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was in hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would have left the neighbourhood by this time.
Mamma said he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was going to travel again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) continued, but
hesitating a little before she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) wishes to see you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I never heard. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would have been satisfied with my
letter. It was as decided as I could make it. If I say I won't see
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), I wonder if his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will or mine will be the strongest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``But you must see him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); you owe it to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will
never be satisfied without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) talks me round into resuming the engagement? I should
only break it off again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you can't be `talked round' if your mind is made up. But
perhaps it is not really, Cynthia?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), with a little wistful
anxiety betraying itself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite made up. I am going to teach little Russian girls; and
am never going to marry nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not serious, Cynthia. And yet it is a very serious thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>But Cynthia went into one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) wild moods, and no more reason or
sensible meaning was to be got out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) at the time.




<p/>CHAPTER LVI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``OFF WITH THE OLD LOVE, AND ON WITH THE NEW.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>The next morning saw Mrs. Gibson in a much more contented frame of
mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had written and posted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) letter, and the next thing was
to keep Cynthia in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) called a reasonable state, or, in other
words, to try and cajole her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) into docility. But it was so much labour
lost. Cynthia had already received a letter from Mr. Henderson before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) came down to breakfast,--a declaration of love, a proposal of
marriage as clear as words could make it; together with an intimation
that, unable to wait for the slow delays of the post, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was going
to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) down to Hollingford, and would arrive at the same time
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had done herself on the previous day. Cynthia said nothing
about this letter to any one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) came late into the breakfast-room,
after Mr. and Mrs. Gibson had finished the actual business of the
meal; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) unpunctuality was quite accounted for by the fact that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been travelling all the night before. Molly was not as yet
strong enough to get up so early. Cynthia hardly spoke, and did not
touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) food. Mr. Gibson went about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) daily business, and Cynthia
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother were left alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, <div class="bookquote">``you are not eating your breakfast as
you should do. I am afraid our meals seem very plain and homely to
you after those in Hyde Park Street?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia; <div class="bookquote">``I'm not hungry, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we were as rich as your uncle, I should feel it to be both a duty
and a pleasure to keep an elegant table; but limited means are a
sad clog to one's wishes. I don't suppose that, work as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will, Mr.
Gibson can earn more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) does at present; while the capabilities
of the law are boundless. Lord Chancellor! Titles as well as
fortune!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia was almost too much absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own reflections to reply,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) did say,--<div class="bookquote">``Hundreds of briefless barristers. Take the other
side, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; but I have noticed that many of these have private fortunes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps. Mamma, I expect Mr. Henderson will come and call this
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my precious child! But how do you know? My darling Cynthia, am I
to congratulate you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No! I suppose I must tell you. I have had a letter this morning from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)'s coming down by the <div class="bookquote">``Umpire' to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) has offered? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) surely must mean to offer, at any rate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia played with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) teaspoon before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) replied; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) looked
up, like one startled from a dream, and caught the echo of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
mother's question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Offered! yes, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And you accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)? Say ``yes,<div class="bookquote">'' Cynthia, and make me happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't say `yes' to make any one happy except myself, and the
Russian scheme has great charms for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said this to plague
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother, and lessen Mrs. Gibson's exuberance of joy, it must be
confessed; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) mind was pretty well made up. But it did not
affect Mrs. Gibson, who affixed even less truth to it than there
really was. The idea of a residence in a new, strange country, among
new, strange people, was not without allurement to Cynthia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You always look nice, dear; but don't you think you had better put
on that pretty lilac silk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not vary a thread or a shred from what I have got on now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You dear, wilful creature! you know you always look lovely in
whatever you put on.''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>So, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) daughter, Mrs. Gibson left the
room, intent on the lunch which should impress Mr. Henderson at once
with an idea of family refinement.

<p/>Cynthia went upstairs to Molly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was inclined to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) about
Mr. Henderson, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) found it impossible to introduce the subject
naturally, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) left it to time to reveal the future as gradually
as it might. Molly was tired with a bad night; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) flying visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) darling before going out, had advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to
stay upstairs for the greater part of the morning, and to keep quiet
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own room till after her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) early dinner, so Time had not a fair
chance of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had in store in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) budget. Mrs. Gibson
sent an apology to Molly for not paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) usual morning visit,
and told Cynthia to give Mr. Henderson's probable coming as a reason
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) occupation downstairs. But Cynthia did no such thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
kissed Molly, and sate silently by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hand; till at
length she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) jumped up, and said, <div class="bookquote">``You shall be left alone now, little
one. I want you to be very well and very bright this afternoon: so
rest now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And Cynthia left her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) own room, locked the
door, and began to think.

<p/>Some one was thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) at the same time, and it was not Mr.
Henderson. Roger had heard from Mr. Gibson that Cynthia had come
home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was resolving to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) at once, and have one strong,
manly attempt to overcome the obstacles whatever they might be--and
of their nature he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not fully aware--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had conjured up
against the continuance of their relation to each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
father--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) left them all--and went off into the woods, to be alone
until the time came when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might mount his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) horse and ride over to
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fate to the touch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was as careful as ever not to interfere
with the morning hours that were tabooed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) of old; but waiting
was very hard work when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was so near, and the time so
near at hand.

<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) rode slowly, compelling himself to quietness and patience when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was once really on the way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Gibson at home? Miss Kirkpatrick?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) asked of the servant,
Maria, who opened the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was confused, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did not notice
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so--I'm not sure! Will you walk up into the drawing-room,
sir? Miss Gibson is there, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went upstairs, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) nerves on the strain for the coming
interview with Cynthia. It was either a relief or a disappointment,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was not sure which, to find only Molly in the room:--Molly, half
lying on the couch in the bow-window which commanded the garden;
draped in soft white drapery, very white herself, and a laced
half-handkerchief tied over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) from any ill effects
of the air that blew in through the open window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was so ready to
speak to Cynthia that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hardly knew what to say to any one else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you are not so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said to Molly, who sat up to
receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), and who suddenly began to tremble with emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a little tired, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was quite
silent, hoping that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might go, and yet somehow wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) to stay.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took a chair and placed it near her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), opposite to the window.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) thought that surely Maria would tell Miss Kirkpatrick that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was
wanted, and that at any moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) might hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) light quick footstep
on the stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ought to talk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) could not think of
anything to say. The pink flush came out on Molly's cheeks; once or
twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was on the point of speaking, but again she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought better
of it; and the pauses between their faint disjointed remarks became
longer and longer. Suddenly, in one of these pauses, the merry murmur
of distant happy voices in the garden came nearer and nearer; Molly
looked more and more uneasy and flushed, and in spite of herself
kept watching Roger's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could see over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) into the garden. A
sudden deep colour overspread him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) heart had sent its blood
out coursing at full gallop. Cynthia and Mr. Henderson had come in
sight; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) eagerly talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) bent forward to look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
face; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) looks half averted in pretty shyness, was evidently
coquetting about some flowers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) either would not give,
or would not take. Just then, for the lovers had emerged from the
shrubbery into comparatively public life, Maria was seen approaching;
apparently she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had feminine tact enough to induce Cynthia to leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) present admirer, and to go a few steps to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) to receive
the whispered message that Mr. Roger Hamley was there, and wished to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Roger could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) startled gesture; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) turned back
to say something to Mr. Henderson before coming towards the house.
Now Roger spoke to Molly--spoke hurriedly, spoke hoarsely.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: CYNTHIA``S LAST LOVER.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly, tell me! Is it too late for me to speak to Cynthia? I came on
purpose. Who is that man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Henderson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) only came to-day--but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) accepted
lover. Oh, Roger, forgive me the pain!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) I have been, and am gone. Send out word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). Don't let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) be interrupted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>And Roger ran downstairs at full speed, and Molly heard the
passionate clang of the outer door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had hardly left the house
before Cynthia entered the room, pale and resolute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said, looking around, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might yet be
hidden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, very faint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone. Oh, what a relief! It seems to be my fate never to be off with
the old lover before I am on with the new, and yet I did write as
decidedly as I could. Why, Molly, what's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>for now Molly
had fainted away utterly. Cynthia flew to the bell, summoned Maria,
water, salts, wine, anything; and as soon as Molly, gasping and
miserable, became conscious again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wrote a little pencil-note to
Mr. Henderson, bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) return to the <div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) had come
in the morning, and saying that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) might be
allowed to call again in the evening, otherwise she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)
till the next day. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sent down by Maria, and the unlucky man
never believed but that it was Miss Gibson's sudden indisposition in
the first instance that had deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) charmer's company.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comforted himself for the long solitary afternoon by writing to
tell all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happiness, and amongst them uncle and
aunt Kirkpatrick, who received his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter by the same post as that
discreet epistle of Mrs. Gibson's, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had carefully arranged
to reveal as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wished, and no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) very terrible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>asked Cynthia, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sate with Molly in the
stillness of Mrs. Gibson's dressing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cynthia, it was such pain to see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) suffered so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like people of deep feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, pouting. <div class="bookquote">``They
don't suit me. Why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) let me go without this fuss? I'm not
worth his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) caring for!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have the happy gift of making people love you. Remember Mr.
Preston,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Preston</b></font>) too wouldn't give up hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I won't have you classing Roger Hamley and Mr. Preston together
in the same sentence. One was as much too bad for me as the other
is too good. Now I hope that man in the garden is the _juste
milieu_,--I'm that myself, for I don't think I'm vicious, and I know
I'm not virtuous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enough to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly earnestly.
<div class="bookquote">``Do think, Cynthia. It won't do to go on throwing your lovers off;
you give pain that I'm sure you do not mean to do,--that you cannot
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I can't. I'm not offended. I never set up for what I am
not, and I know I'm not constant. I've told Mr. Henderson so--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
stopped, blushing and smiling at the recollection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have! and what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) liked me just as I was; so you see he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)'s fairly warned. Only
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)'s a little afraid, I suppose,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) wants me to be married very
soon, almost directly, in fact. But I don't know if I shall give
way,--you hardly saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>), Molly,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)'s coming again to-night, and
mind, I'll never forgive you if you don't think him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) very charming.
I believe I cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) offered all those months ago, but
I tried to think I didn't; only sometimes I really was so unhappy,
I thought I must put an iron band round my heart to keep it from
breaking, like the Faithful John of the German story,--do you
remember, Molly?--how when his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) master came to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) crown and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
fortune and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lady-love, after innumerable trials and disgraces,
and was driving away from the church where he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'d been married in a
coach and six, with Faithful John behind, the happy couple heard
three great cracks in succession, and on inquiring, they were the
iron-bands round his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart, that Faithful John had worn all during
the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) master's tribulation, to keep it from breaking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henderson/Henderson</b></font>)</div><p/>In the evening Mr. Henderson came. Molly had been very curious to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>); and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was not sure whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) or
not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was handsome, without being conceited; gentlemanly, without
being foolishly fine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) talked easily, and never said a silly thing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was perfectly well-appointed, yet never seemed to have given a
thought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was good-tempered and kind; not without some
of the cheerful flippancy of repartee which belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) age and
profession, and which his (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) age and profession are apt to take for
wit. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) wanted something in Molly's eyes--at any rate, in this
first interview, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart of hearts she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) rather
commonplace. But of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said nothing of this to Cynthia, who
was evidently as happy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) could be. Mrs. Gibson, too, was in
the seventh heaven of ecstasy, and spoke but little; but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
did say, expressed the highest sentiments in the finest language.
Mr. Gibson was not with them for long, but while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
was evidently studying the unconscious Mr. Henderson with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) dark
penetrating eyes. Mr. Henderson behaved exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) ought to have
done to everybody: respectful to Mr. Gibson, deferential to Mrs.
Gibson, friendly to Molly, devoted to Cynthia.

<p/>The next time Mr. Gibson found Molly alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) began,--<div class="bookquote">``Well! and how
do you like the new relation that is to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's difficult to say. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s very nice in all his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) bits,
but--rather dull on the whole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) perfection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, to Molly's surprise;
but in an instant afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been speaking
ironically. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) preferred him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to Roger
Hamley. Such scents! such gloves! And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) hair and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) cravat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, papa, you're not fair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is a great deal more than that. One
could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had very good feeling; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is very handsome, and
very much attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So was Roger. However, I must confess I shall be only too glad to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) married. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a girl who'll always have some love-affair on
hand, and will always be apt to slip through a man's fingers if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
doesn't look sharp; as I was saying to Roger--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), then, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Met him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in the street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d been going through the pleasantest thing in
the world; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'ll get over it before long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke with sense
and resignation, and didn't say much about it; but one could see
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was feeling it pretty sharply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s had three months to
think it over, remember. The Squire, I should guess, is showing more
indignation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is boiling over, that any one should reject his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son!
The enormity of the sin never seems to have been apparent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
till now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sees how Roger is affected by it. Indeed, with the
exception of myself, I don't know one reasonable father; eh, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henderson/Henderson</b></font>)</div><p/>Whatever else Mr. Henderson might be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was an impatient lover; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)
wanted to marry Cynthia directly--next week--the week after; at any
rate before the long vacation, so that they could go abroad at once.
Trousseaux, and preliminary ceremonies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) gave to the winds. Mr.
Gibson, generous as usual, called Cynthia aside a morning or two
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) engagement, and put a hundred-pound note into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! that's to pay your expenses to Russia and back. I hope you'll
find your pupils obedient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) surprise, and rather to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) discomfiture, Cynthia threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) neck and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the kindest person I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and I don't know how
to thank you in words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you tumble my shirt-collars again in that way, I'll charge you
for the washing. Just now, too, when I'm trying so hard to be trim
and elegant, like your Mr. Henderson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do like him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>), don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>said Cynthia, pleadingly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) does
so like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. We're all angels just now, and you're an arch-angel. I
hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)'ll wear as well as Roger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Cynthia looked grave. <div class="bookquote">``That was a very silly affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We
were two as unsuitable people--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has ended, and that's enough. Besides, I've no more time to
waste; and there's your smart young man coming here in all haste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mrs.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick sent all manner of congratulations; and
Mrs. Gibson, in a private letter, assured Mrs. Kirkpatrick that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) ill-timed confidence about Roger should be considered as quite
private. For as soon as Mr. Henderson had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) appearance in
Hollingford, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had written a second letter, entreating them not to
allude to anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) might have said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) first; which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) said
was written in such excitement on discovering the real state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
daughter's affections, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had hardly known what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) had said,
and had exaggerated some things, and misunderstood others: all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) did know now was, that Mr. Henderson had just proposed to
Cynthia, and was accepted, and that they were as happy as the day
was long, and -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``excuse the vanity of a mother,'' (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>-RRB- made a most lovely
couple. So Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick wrote back an equally agreeable
letter, praising Mr. Henderson, admiring Cynthia, and generally
congratulatory; insisting into the bargain that the marriage should
take place from their house in Hyde Park Street, and that Mr. and
Mrs. Gibson and Molly should all come up and pay them a visit. There
was a little postscript at the end. <div class="bookquote">``Surely you do not mean the
famous traveller, Hamley, about whose discoveries all our scientific
men are so much excited. You speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) as a young Hamley, who went
to Africa. Answer this question, pray, for Helen is most anxious to
know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen/Helen Kirkpatrick</b></font>)</div>This P.S. being in Helen's handwriting. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) exultation
at the general success of everything, and desire for sympathy, Mrs.
Gibson read parts of this letter to Molly; the postscript among the
rest. It made a deeper impression on Molly than even the proposed
kindness of the visit to London.

<p/>There were some family consultations; but the end of them all was
that the Kirkpatrick invitation was accepted. There were many small
reasons for this, which were openly acknowledged; but there was
one general and unspoken wish to have the ceremony performed out
of the immediate neighbourhood of the two men whom Cynthia had
previously--rejected; that was the word now to be applied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
treatment of them. So Molly was ordered and enjoined and entreated
to become strong as soon as possible, in order that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) health might
not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) attending the marriage; Mr. Gibson himself, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
thought it his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) duty to damp the exultant anticipations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife
and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter, being not at all averse to the prospect of going
to London, and seeing half-a-dozen old friends, and many scientific
exhibitions, independently of the very fair amount of liking which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
had for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) host, Mr. Kirkpatrick himself.




<p/>CHAPTER LVII.

<p/>BRIDAL VISITS AND ADIEUX.


<p/>The whole town of Hollingford came to congratulate and inquire into
particulars. Some indeed--Mrs. Goodenough at the head of this class
of malcontents--thought that they were defrauded of their right to
a fine show by Cynthia's being married in London. Even Lady Cumnor
was moved into action. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), who had hardly ever paid calls <div class="bookquote">``out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own sphere,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>who had only once been to see <div class="bookquote">``Clare''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own
house--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) came to congratulate after her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) fashion. Maria had only
just time to run up into the drawing-room one morning, and say,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, ma'am, the great carriage from the Towers is coming up to
the gate, and my lady the Countess is sitting inside.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>It was but
eleven o'clock, and Mrs. Gibson would have been indignant at any
commoner who had ventured to call at such an untimely hour, but in
the case of the Peerage the rules of domestic morality were relaxed.

<p/>The family <div class="bookquote">``stood at arms,''  (<font color='red'><b>The family</b></font>)</div>as it were, till Lady Cumnor appeared in
the drawing-room; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had to be settled in the best chair,
and the light adjusted before anything like conversation began. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
was the first to speak; and Lady Harriet, who had begun a few words
to Molly, dropped into silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been taking Mary--Lady Cuxhaven--to the railway station on
this new line between Birmingham and London, and I thought I would
come on here, and offer you my congratulations. Clare, which is
the young lady?'' (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia Molly</b></font>)</div>--putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) glasses, and looking at Cynthia
and Molly, who were dressed pretty much alike. <div class="bookquote">``I did not think it
would be amiss to give you a little advice, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), when
Cynthia had been properly pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) as bride elect. <div class="bookquote">``I
have heard a good deal about you; and I am only too glad, for your
mother's sake,--your mother is a very worthy woman, and did her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) duty
very well while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in our family--I am truly rejoiced, I say,
to hear that you are going to make so creditable a marriage. I hope
it will efface your former errors of conduct--which, we will hope,
were but trivial in reality--and that you will live to be a comfort
to your mother,--for whom both Lord Cumnor and I entertain a very
sincere regard. But you must conduct yourself with discretion in
whatever state of life it pleases God to place you, whether married
or single. You must reverence your husband, and conform to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
opinion in all things. Look up to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as your head, and do nothing
without consulting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).'' (<font color='red'><b>Lord Cumnor</b></font>)</div>--It was as well that Lord Cumnor was
not amongst the audience; or he (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) might have compared precept with
practice.--<div class="bookquote">``Keep strict accounts; and remember your station in life.
I understand that Mr.--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>looking about for some help as to the name
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had forgotten--<div class="bookquote">``Anderson--Henderson is in the law. Although there
is a general prejudice against attorneys, I have known of two or
three who were very respectable men; and I am sure Mr. Henderson is
one, or your good mother and our old friend Gibson would not have
sanctioned the engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) is a barrister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)</div>put in Cynthia, unable to restrain herself any
longer. <div class="bookquote">``Barrister-at-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes. Attorney-at-law. Barrister-at-law. I understand without
your speaking so loud, my dear. What was I going to say before you
interrupted me? When you have been a little in society you will find
that it is reckoned bad manners to interrupt. I had a great deal more
to say to you, and you have put it all out of my head. There was
something else your father wanted me to ask--what was it, Harriet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you mean about Mr. Hamley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! we are intending to have the house full of Lord
Hollingford's friends next month, and Lord Cumnor is particularly
anxious to secure Mr. Hamley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Squire?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Gibson in some surprise. Lady Cumnor bowed
slightly, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``If you did not interrupt me I should
explain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The famous traveller--the scientific Mr. Hamley, I mean. I imagine
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) is son to the Squire. Lord Hollingford knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) well; but when we
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) declined coming, and assigned no reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Had Roger indeed been asked to the Towers and declined? Mrs. Gibson
could not understand it. Lady Cumnor went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now this time we are particularly anxious to secure him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>), and my
son Lord Hollingford will not return to England until the very week
before the Duke of Atherstone is coming to us. I believe Mr. Gibson
is very intimate with Mr. Hamley; do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) could induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) to
favour us with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) company?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div><p/>And this from the proud Lady Cumnor; and the object of it Roger
Hamley, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had all but turned out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) drawing-room two years
ago for calling at an untimely hour; and whom Cynthia had turned out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) heart. Mrs. Gibson was surprised, and could only murmur out
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was sure Mr. Gibson would do all that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ladyship wished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. You know me well enough to be aware that I am not the
person, nor is the Towers the house, to go about soliciting guests.
But in this instance I bend my head; high rank should always be the
first to honour those who have distinguished themselves by art or
science.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``papa was saying that the
Hamleys have been on their land since before the Conquest; while we
only came into the county a century ago; and there is a tale that
the first Cumnor began his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamleys</b></font>) fortune through selling tobacco in King
James's reign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>If Lady Cumnor did not exactly shift her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) trumpet and take snuff
there on the spot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) behaved in an equivalent manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) began
a low-toned but nevertheless authoritative conversation with Clare
about the details of the wedding, which lasted until she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) thought it
fit to go, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) abruptly plucked Lady Harriet up, and carried
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) off in the very midst of a description she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) was giving to Cynthia
about the delights of Spa, which was to be one of the resting-places
of the newly-married couple on their wedding-tour.

<p/>Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) prepared a handsome present for the bride: a Bible
and a Prayer-book bound in velvet with silver-clasps; and also a
collection of household account-books, at the beginning of which Lady
Cumnor wrote down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) own hand the proper weekly allowance of
bread, butter, eggs, meat, and groceries per head, with the London
prices of the articles, so that the most inexperienced housekeeper
might ascertain whether her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) expenditure exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) means, as she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
expressed herself in the note which she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) sent with the handsome, dull
present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are driving into Hollingford, Harriet, perhaps you will take
these books to Miss Kirkpatrick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Cumnor</b></font>)</div>said Lady Cumnor, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) had
sealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) note with all the straightness and correctness befitting
a countess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) immaculate character. <div class="bookquote">``I understand they are
all going up to London to-morrow for this wedding, in spite of
what I said to Clare of the duty of being married in one's own
parish-church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) told me at the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) entirely agreed
with me, but that her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) husband had such a strong wish for a visit to
London, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) consistently
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wifely duty. I advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to repeat to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) my reasons for
thinking that they would be ill-advised to have the marriage in town;
but I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) has been overruled. That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) one great fault
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lived with us; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was always so yielding, and never knew
how to say `No.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, with a little sly coaxing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tone.
``Do you think you would have been so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had opposed
you, and said ``No,<div class="bookquote">'' when you wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to say `Yes?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure I should, my dear. I like everybody to have an opinion of
their own; only when my opinions are based on thought and experience,
which few people have had equal opportunities of acquiring, I think
it is but proper deference in others to allow themselves to be
convinced. In fact, I think it is only obstinacy which keeps them
from acknowledging that they are. I am not a despot, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
asked, with some anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are, dear mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet, kissing the stern
uplifted face very fondly, <div class="bookquote">``I like a despotism better than a
republic, and I must be very despotic over my ponies, for it's
already getting very late for my drive round by Ash-holt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div><p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) arrived at the Gibsons', she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was detained so long there
by the state of the family, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) going to
Ash-holt.

<p/>Molly was sitting in the drawing-room pale and trembling, and keeping
herself quiet only by a strong effort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was the only person there
when Lady Harriet entered: the room was all in disorder, strewed with
presents and paper, and pasteboard boxes, and half-displayed articles
of finery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look like Marius sitting amidst the ruins of Carthage, my dear!
What's the matter? Why have you got on that wobegone face? This
marriage isn't broken off, is it? Though nothing would surprise me
where the beautiful Cynthia is concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! that's all right. But I have caught a fresh cold, and papa
says he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) thinks I had better not go to the wedding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little one! And it's the first visit to London too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But what I most care for is the not being with Cynthia to
the last; and then, papa'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) stopped, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could hardly go
on without open crying, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not want to do that. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``has so looked forward to
this holiday,--and seeing--and--, and going--oh! I can't tell you
where; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) has quite a list of people and sights to be seen,--and
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) should not be comfortable to leave me all alone for
more than three days,--two for travelling, and one for the wedding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Just then Mrs. Gibson came in, ruffled too after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fashion, though
the presence of Lady Harriet was wonderfully smoothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Harriet--how kind of you! Ah, yes, I see this poor
unfortunate child has been telling you of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ill-luck; just when
everything was going on so beautifully; I'm sure it was that open
window at your back, Molly,--you know you would persist that it could
do you no harm, and now you see the mischief! I'm sure I shan't be
able to enjoy myself--and at my only child's wedding too--without
you; for I can't think of leaving you without Maria. I would rather
sacrifice anything myself than think of you, uncared for, and dismal
at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure Molly is as sorry as any one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Harriet/Harriet/LADY HARRIET</b></font>)</div>said Lady Harriet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, with happy disregard of
the chronology of events, <div class="bookquote">``or she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would not have sate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) back
to an open window the day before yesterday, when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) not. But
it can't be helped now. Papa too--but it is my duty to make the best
of everything, and look at the cheerful side of life. I wish I could
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to do the same''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning and addressing Lady Harriet-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``But, you see, it is a great mortification to a girl of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) age to
lose her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) first visit to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>began Molly; but Lady Harriet made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a little
sign to be silent while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) herself spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Clare! you and I can manage it all, I think, if you will but
help me in a plan I've got in my head. Mr. Gibson shall stay as long
as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) can in London; and Molly shall be well cared for, and have
some change of air and scene too, which is really what she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) needs
as much as anything, in my poor opinion. I can't spirit her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to the
wedding and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a sight of London; but I can carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) off to
the Towers, and nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) myself; and send daily bulletins up to
London, so that Mr. Gibson may feel quite at ease, and stay with you
as long as you like. What do you say to it, Clare?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I could not go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``I should only be a trouble to
everybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody asked you for your opinion, little one. If we wise elders
decide that you are to go, you must submit in silence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile Mrs. Gibson was rapidly balancing advantages and
disadvantages. Amongst the latter, jealousy came in predominant.
Amongst the former,--it would sound well; Maria could then accompany
Cynthia and herself as <div class="bookquote">``their maid;''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gibson would stay longer
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and it was always desirable to have a man at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) beck and
call in such a place as London; besides that, this identical man was
gentlemanly and good-looking, and a favourite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) prosperous
brother-in-law. The <div class="bookquote">``ayes''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a charming plan! I cannot think of anything kinder or
pleasanter for this poor darling. Only--what will Lady Cumnor say? I
am modest for my family as much as for myself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) won't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know mamma's sense of hospitality is never more gratified than
when the house is quite full; and papa is just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>). Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>)
is fond of you, and grateful to our good Mr. Gibson, and will be fond
of you, little one, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) knows you as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly's heart sank within her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) at the prospect. Except on the one
evening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father's wedding-day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had never even seen the
outside of the Towers since that unlucky day in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) childhood
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had fallen asleep on Clare's bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had a dread of the
countess, a dislike to the house; only it seemed as if it was a
solution to the problem of what to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), which had been
perplexing every one all morning, and so evidently that it had
caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) much distress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) kept silence, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lips quivered
from time to time. Oh, if Miss Brownings had not chosen this very
time of all others to pay their monthly visit to Miss Hornblower!
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hornblower</b></font>) could only have gone there, and lived with them in their
quaint, quiet, primitive way, instead of having to listen, without
remonstrance, to hearing plans discussed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hornblower</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hornblower</b></font>) was an
inanimate chattel!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) shall have the south pink room, opening out of mine by one door,
you remember; and the dressing-room shall be made into a cosy little
sitting-room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), in case she (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) likes to be by herself. Parkes
shall attend upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>), and I'm sure Mr. Gibson must know Parkes's
powers as a nurse by this time. We shall have all manner of agreeable
people in the house to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) downstairs; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) has got rid
of this access of cold, I will drive her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) out every day, and write
daily bulletins, as I said. Pray tell Mr. Gibson all that, and let it
be considered as settled. I will come for her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) in the close carriage
to-morrow, at eleven. And now may I see the lovely bride-elect, and
give her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) mamma's present, and my own good wishes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>So Cynthia came in, and demurely received the very proper present,
and the equally correct congratulations, without testifying any very
great delight or gratitude at either; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was quite quick enough
to detect there was no great afflux of affection accompanying either.
But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother quickly recapitulating all the details
of the plan for Molly, Cynthia's eyes did sparkle with gladness; and
almost to Lady Harriet's surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had
conferred a personal favour upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), Cynthia. Lady Harriet saw,
too, that in a very quiet way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had taken Molly's hand, and was
holding it all the time, as if loth to think of their approaching
separation--somehow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and Lady Harriet were brought nearer
together by this little action than they had ever been before.

<p/>If Molly had hoped that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father might have raised some obstacles
to the project, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was disappointed. But, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was satisfied
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) perceived how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to feel that, by placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) under
the care of Lady Harriet and Parkes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should be relieved from
anxiety; and how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke of this change of air and scene as being
the very thing he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been wishing to secure for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); country air,
and absence of excitement as this would be; for the only other place
where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could have secured her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) these advantages, and at the same
time sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as an invalid, was to Hamley Hall; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) dreaded the
associations there with the beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) present illness.

<p/>So Molly was driven off in state the next day, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own home
all in confusion with the assemblage of boxes and trunks in the hall,
and all the other symptoms of the approaching departure of the family
for London and the wedding. All the morning Cynthia had been with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) room, attending to the arrangement of Molly's clothes,
instructing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) what to wear with what, and rejoicing over the pretty
smartnesses, which, having been prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) as bridesmaid, were
now to serve as adornments for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) visit to the Towers. Both Molly
and Cynthia spoke about dress as if it was the very object of their
lives; for each dreaded the introduction of more serious subjects;
Cynthia more for Molly than herself. Only when the carriage was
announced, and Molly was preparing to go downstairs, Cynthia said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to thank you, Molly, or to tell you how I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``I can't bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only you know you are to be my first visitor, and if you wear brown
ribbons to a green gown, I'll turn you out of the house!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So they
parted. Mr. Gibson was there in the hall to hand Molly in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had
ridden hard; and was now giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) two or three last injunctions as
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) health.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of us on Thursday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I declare I don't know which of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) three lovers she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mayn't summon at the very last moment to act the
part of bridegroom. I'm determined to be surprised at nothing; and
will give her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) away with a good grace to whoever comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>They drove away, and until they were out of sight of the house, Molly
had enough to do to keep returning the kisses of the hand wafted to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother out of the drawing-room window, while at the
same time her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes were fixed on a white handkerchief fluttering out
of the attic from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) herself had watched Roger's departure
nearly two years before. What changes time had brought!

<p/>When Molly arrived at the Towers she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was convoyed into Lady Cumnor's
presence by Lady Harriet. It was a mark of respect to the lady of the
house, which the latter knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother would expect; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
was anxious to get it over, and take Molly up into the room which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had been so busy arranging for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Lady Cumnor was, however, very
kind, if not positively gracious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are Lady Harriet's visitor, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
will take good care of you. If not, come and complain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was as near an approach to a joke as Lady Cumnor ever perpetrated,
and from it Lady Harriet knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother was pleased by Molly's
manners and appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, here you are in your own kingdom; and into this room I shan't
venture to come without express permission. Here is the last new
_Quarterly_, and the last new novel, and the last new Essays. Now, my
dear, you needn't come down again to-day unless you like it. Parkes
shall bring you everything and anything you want. You must get strong
as fast as you can, for all sorts of great and famous people are
coming to-morrow and the next day, and I think you'll like to see
them. Suppose for to-day you only come down to lunch, and if you
like it, in the evening. Dinner is such a wearily long meal, if one
isn't strong; and you wouldn't miss much, for there's only my cousin
Charles in the house now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is the personification of sensible
silence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly was only too glad to allow Lady Harriet to decide everything
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). It had begun to rain, and was altogether a gloomy day for
August; and there was a small fire of scented wood burning cheerfully
in the sitting-room appropriated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). High up, it commanded a
wide and pleasant view over the park, and from it could be seen the
spire of Hollingford Church, which gave Molly a pleasant idea of
neighbourhood to home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was left alone, lying on the sofa--books
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), wood crackling and blazing, wafts of wind bringing the
beating rain against the window, and so enhancing the sense of indoor
comfort by the outdoor contrast. Parkes was unpacking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Lady
Harriet had introduced Parkes to Molly by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Molly, this
is Mrs. Parkes, the only person I am ever afraid of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Parkes</b></font>) scolds me if
I dirty myself with my paints, just as if I was a little child; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Parkes</b></font>) makes me go to bed when I want to sit up,'' (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>--Parkes was smiling
grimly all the time;--<div class="bookquote">``so to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Parkes</b></font>) tyranny I give her (<font color='blue'><b>Parkes</b></font>) you as
victim. Parkes, rule over Miss Gibson with a rod of iron; make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
eat and drink, and rest and sleep, and dress as you think wisest and
best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Parkes</b></font>)</div><p/>Parkes had begun her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) reign by putting Molly on the sofa, and saying,
<div class="bookquote">``If you will give me your keys, Miss, I will unpack your things, and
let you know when it is time for me to arrange your hair, preparatory
to luncheon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>For if Lady Harriet used familiar colloquialisms from
time to time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) certainly had not learnt it from Parkes, who piqued
herself on the correctness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) language.

<p/>When Molly went down to lunch she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found <div class="bookquote">``cousin Charles,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with his (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
aunt, Lady Cumnor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was a certain Sir Charles Morton, the son of
Lady Cumnor's only sister: a plain, sandy-haired man of thirty-five
or so; immensely rich, very sensible, awkward, and reserved. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
had a chronic attachment, of many years' standing, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin,
Lady Harriet, who did not care for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the least, although it
was the marriage very earnestly desired for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother. Lady
Harriet was, however, on friendly terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about,
and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what to do, and what to leave undone, without having
even a doubt as to the willingness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) obedience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had given
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cue about Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Charles, the girl wants to be interested and amused without
having to take any trouble for herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is too delicate to be
very active either in mind or body. Just look after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when the
house gets full, and place her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can hear and see everything
and everybody, without any fuss and responsibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Morton</b></font>)</div><p/>So Sir Charles began this day at luncheon by taking Molly under his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
quiet protection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not say much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>); but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did say was
thoroughly friendly and sympathetic; and Molly began, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and Lady
Harriet intended that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should, to have a kind of pleasant reliance
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Then in the evening while the rest of the family were at
dinner--after Molly's tea and hour of quiet repose, Parkes came and
dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in some of the new clothes prepared for the Kirkpatrick
visit, and did her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) hair in some new and pretty way, so that when
Molly looked at herself in the cheval-glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) scarcely knew the
elegant reflection to be that of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was fetched down by
Lady Harriet into the great long formidable drawing-room, which as
an interminable place of pacing, had haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) dreams ever since
her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) childhood. At the further end sat Lady Cumnor at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cumnor</b></font>) tapestry
work; the light of fire and candle seemed all concentrated on that
one bright part where presently Lady Harriet made tea, and Lord
Cumnor went to sleep, and Sir Charles read passages aloud from the
_Edinburgh Review_ to the three ladies at their work.

<p/>When Molly went to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was constrained to admit that staying at
the Towers as a visitor was rather pleasant than otherwise; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
tried to reconcile old impressions with new ones, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fell
asleep. There was another comparatively quiet day before the expected
guests began to arrive in the evening. Lady Harriet took Molly a
drive in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) little pony-carriage; and for the first time for many
weeks Molly began to feel the delightful spring of returning health;
the dance of youthful spirits in the fresh air cleared by the
previous day's rain.




<p/>CHAPTER LVIII.

<p/>REVIVING HOPES AND BRIGHTENING PROSPECTS.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can without fatigue, dear, do come down to dinner to-day;
you'll then see the people one by one as they appear, instead of
having to encounter a crowd of strangers. Hollingford will be here
too. I hope you'll find it pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>So Molly made her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) appearance at dinner that day; and got to know, by
sight at least, some of the most distinguished of the visitors at the
Towers. The next day was Thursday, Cynthia's wedding-day; bright and
fine in the country, whatever it might be in London. And there were
several letters from the home-people awaiting Molly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came
downstairs to the late breakfast. For, every day, every hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was
gaining strength and health, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was unwilling to continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
invalid habits any longer than was necessary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked so much
better that Sir Charles noticed it to Lady Harriet; and several of
the visitors spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) this morning as a very pretty, lady-like,
and graceful girl. This was Thursday; on Friday, as Lady Harriet had
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), some visitors from the more immediate neighbourhood were
expected to stay over the Sunday; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not mentioned their
names, and when Molly went down into the drawing-room before dinner,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was almost startled by perceiving Roger Hamley in the centre of
a group of gentlemen, who were all talking together eagerly, and, as
it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), making him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) the object of their attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) made
a hitch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) conversation, lost the precise meaning of a question
addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), answered it rather hastily, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) way
to where Molly was sitting, a little behind Lady Harriet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) had
heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was staying at the Towers, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) was almost as much
surprised by hers, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) unexpected appearance, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
had only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) once or twice since his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) return from Africa, and
then in the guise of an invalid. Now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) pretty evening dress,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hair beautifully dressed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) delicate complexion flushed a
little with timidity, yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) movements and manners bespeaking quiet
ease, Roger hardly recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), although he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
identity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) began to feel that admiring deference which most young
men experience when conversing with a very pretty girl: a sort of
desire to obtain her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good opinion in a manner very different to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
old familiar friendliness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was annoyed when Sir Charles, whose
especial charge she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still was, came up to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in to dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
could not quite understand the smile of mutual intelligence that
passed between the two, each being aware of Lady Harriet's plan
of sheltering Molly from the necessity of talking, and acting in
conformity with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wishes as much as with their own. Roger found
himself puzzling, and watching them from time to time during
dinner. Again in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) out, but found her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) again
pre-occupied with one of the young men staying in the house, who had
had the advantage of two days of mutual interest, and acquaintance
with the daily events and jokes and anxieties of the family circle.
Molly could not help wishing to break off all this trivial talk and
to make room for Roger: she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had so much to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) about everything
at the Hall; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was, and had been such a stranger to them all for
these last two months, and more. But though each wanted to speak to
the other more than to any one else in the room, it so happened that
everything seemed to conspire to prevent it. Lord Hollingford carried
off Roger to the cluster of middle-aged men; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was wanted to give
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) opinion upon some scientific subject. Mr. Ernulphus Watson,
the young man referred to above, kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) place by Molly, as the
prettiest girl in the room, and almost dazed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) never-ceasing
flow of clever small-talk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked so tired and pale at last that
the ever-watchful Lady Harriet sent Sir Charles to the rescue, and
after a few words with Lady Harriet, Roger saw Molly quietly leave
the room; and a sentence or two which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) heard Lady Harriet address
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cousin made him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) know that it was for the night. Those
sentences might bear another interpretation than the obvious one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Charles, considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is in your charge, I think you
might have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from the chatter and patter of Mr. Watson; I can
only stand it when I am in the strongest health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Why was Molly in Sir Charles's charge? why? Then Roger remembered
many little things that might serve to confirm the fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had got
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went to bed puzzled and annoyed. It seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) such an incongruous, hastily-got-up sort of engagement, if
engagement it really was. On Saturday they were more fortunate: they
had a long _tête-à-tête_ in the most public place in the house--on a
sofa in the hall where Molly was resting at Lady Harriet's command
before going upstairs after a walk. Roger was passing through, and
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and making pretence of
playing with the gold-fish in a great marble basin close at hand,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very unlucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to get near you last night,
but it was quite impossible. You were so busy talking to Mr. Watson,
until Sir Charles Morton came and carried you off--with such an air
of authority! Have you known him (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Now this was not at all the manner in which Roger had pre-determined
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would speak of Sir Charles to Molly; but the words came out
in spite of himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! not long. I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) before I came here--on Tuesday. But
Lady Harriet told him (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) to see that I did not get tired, for I wanted
to come down; but you know I have not been strong. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) is a cousin of
Lady Harriet's, and does all she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) is not handsome; but I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) is a very sensible man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I should think so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) is so silent though, that I can hardly
judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) bears a very high character in the county,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, willing
now to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) full due.

<p/>Molly stood up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go upstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I only sate down here for a minute
or two because Lady Harriet bade me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a little longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This is really the pleasantest
place; this basin of water-lilies gives one the idea, if not the
sensation, of coolness; besides--it seems so long since I saw you,
and I have a message from my father to give you. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is very angry
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angry with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard that you had come here for change of air; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
offended that you hadn't come to us--to the Hall, instead. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said
that you should have remembered old friends!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly took all this quite gravely, and did not at first notice the
smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I am so sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But will you please tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) how it
all happened. Lady Harriet called the very day when it was settled
that I was not to go to--''  (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div>Cynthia's wedding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was going to add,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) suddenly stopped short, and, blushing deeply, changed the
expression, <div class="bookquote">``go to London, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) planned it all in a minute, and
convinced mamma and papa, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own way. There was really no
resisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you will have to tell all this to my father yourself if you
mean to make your peace. Why can you not come on to the Hall when you
leave the Towers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>To go in the cool manner suggested from one house to another, after
the manner of a royal progress, was not at all according to Molly's
primitive home-keeping notions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made answer,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it very much, some time. But I must go home first.
They will want me more than ever now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt herself touching on a sore subject, and stopped short.
Roger became annoyed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) so constantly conjecturing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) must
be feeling on the subject of Cynthia's marriage. With sympathetic
perception she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had discerned that the idea must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pain; and
perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) also knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would dislike to show the pain; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
had not the presence of mind or ready wit to give a skilful turn to
the conversation. All this annoyed Roger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could hardly tell why.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) determined to take the metaphorical bull by the horns. Until that
was done, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) footing with Molly would always be insecure; as it
always is between two friends, who mutually avoid a subject to which
their thoughts perpetually recur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of course you must be of double importance now
Miss Kirkpatrick has left you. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) marriage in _The Times_
yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tone of voice was changed in speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) name had
been named between them, and that was the great thing to accomplish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I think I must urge my father's claim for a
short visit, and all the more, because I can really see the apparent
improvement in your health since I came,--only yesterday. Besides,
Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>it was the old familiar Roger of former days who spoke now,
<div class="bookquote">``I think you could help us at home. Aimée is shy and awkward with my
father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has never taken quite kindly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),--yet I know they
would like and value each other, if some one could but bring them
together,--and it would be such a comfort to me if this could take
place before I have to leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To leave--are you going away again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Have you not heard? I didn't complete my engagement. I'm going
again in September for six months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember. But somehow I fancied--you seemed to have settled down
into the old ways at the Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So my father appears to think. But it is not likely I shall ever
make it my home again; and that is partly the reason why I want my
father to adopt the notion of Aimée's living with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Ah, here are
all the people coming back from their walk. However, I shall see you
again; perhaps this afternoon we may get a little quiet time, for I
have a great deal to consult you about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>They separated then, and Molly went upstairs very happy, very full
and warm at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heart; it was so pleasant to have Roger talking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in this way, like a friend; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had once thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could
never look upon the great brown-bearded celebrity in the former light
of almost brotherly intimacy, but now it was all coming right. There
was no opportunity for renewed confidences that afternoon. Molly went
a quiet decorous drive as fourth with two dowagers and one spinster;
but it was very pleasant to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should see him (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) again at
dinner, and again to-morrow. On the Sunday evening, as they all were
sitting and loitering on the lawn before dinner, Roger went on with
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had to say about the position of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sister-in-law in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
father's house: the mutual bond between the mother and grandfather
being the child; who was also, through jealousy, the bone of
contention and the severance. There were many little details to be
given in order to make Molly quite understand the difficulty of the
situations on both sides; and the young man and the girl became
absorbed in what they were talking about, and wandered away into the
shade of the long avenue. Lady Harriet separated herself from a group
and came up to Lord Hollingford, who was sauntering a little apart,
and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) arm within his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) with the familiarity of a favourite
sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think that your pattern young man, and my favourite young
woman, are finding out each other's good qualities?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) had not been observing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look along the avenue; who are those?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hamley and--is it not Miss Gibson? I can't quite make out. Oh!
if you're letting your fancy run off in that direction, I can tell
you it's quite waste of time. Roger Hamley is a man who will soon
have an European reputation!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very possible, and yet it doesn't make any difference in my
opinion. Molly Gibson is capable of appreciating him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) is a very pretty, good little country-girl. I don't mean to say
anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember the Charity Ball; you called her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) `unusually intelligent'
after you had danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) there. But, after all, we are like
the genie and the fairy in the _Arabian Nights' Entertainment_, who
each cried up the merits of the Prince Caramalzaman and the Princess
Badoura.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hamley is not a marrying man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has very little private fortune, and I know that
science is not a remunerative profession, if profession it can be
called.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if that's all--a hundred things may happen--some one may leave
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a fortune--or this tiresome little heir that nobody wanted, may
die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, Harriet, that's the worst of allowing yourself to plan far
ahead for the future; you are sure to contemplate the death of some
one, and to reckon upon the contingency as affecting events.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if lawyers were not always doing something of the kind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it to those to whom it is necessary. I dislike planning
marriages or looking forward to deaths about equally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are getting very prosaic and tiresome, Hollingford!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only getting!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) smiling; <div class="bookquote">``I thought you had always looked
upon me as a tiresome matter-of-fact fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, if you're going to fish for a compliment I am gone. Only
remember my prophecy when my vision comes to pass; or make a bet,
and whoever wins shall spend the money on a present to Prince
Caramalzaman or Princess Badoura, as the case may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Hollingford/Hollingford</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Hollingford remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) sister's words as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) heard Roger say
to Molly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was leaving the Towers on the following day,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I may tell my father that you will come and pay him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a visit
next week? You don't know what pleasure it will give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had
been on the point of saying <div class="bookquote">``will give _us_,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had an instinct
which told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) it was as well to consider Molly's promised visit as
exclusively made to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father.

<p/>The next day Molly went home; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was astonished at herself for
being so sorry to leave the Towers; and found it difficult, if not
impossible, to reconcile the long-fixed idea of the house as a place
wherein to suffer all a child's tortures of dismay and forlornness
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) new and fresh conception. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had gained health, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had
had pleasure, the faint fragrance of a new and unacknowledged hope
had stolen into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) life. No wonder that Mr. Gibson was struck with
the improvement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looks, and Mrs. Gibson impressed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
increased grace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it's really wonderful to see what a little
good society will do for a girl. Even a week of association with such
people as one meets with at the Towers is, as somebody said of a
lady of rank whose name I have forgotten, 'a polite education in
itself.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There is something quite different about you--a _je ne
sais quoi_--that would tell me at once that you have been mingling
with the aristocracy. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) charms, it was what my darling
Cynthia wanted; not that Mr. Henderson thought so, for a more devoted
lover can hardly be conceived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) absolutely bought her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) a parure of
diamonds. I was obliged to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) that I had studied to preserve
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) simplicity of taste, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) must not corrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) with too
much luxury. But I was rather disappointed at their going off without
a maid. It was the one blemish in the arrangements--the spot in the
sun. Dear Cynthia, when I think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), I do assure you, Molly, I
make it my nightly prayer that I may be able to find you just such
another husband. And all this time you have never told me who you met
at the Towers?''

<p/>Molly ran over a list of names. Roger Hamley's came last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word! That young man is pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Hamleys are a far older family than the Cumnors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly,
flushing up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Molly, I can't have you democratic. Rank is a great
distinction. It is quite enough to have dear papa with democratic
tendencies. But we won't begin to quarrel. Now that you and I are
left alone, we ought to be bosom friends, and I hope we shall be.
Roger Hamley did not say much about that unfortunate little Osborne
Hamley, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) father dotes on the child; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
seemed very proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>), himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought the Squire must be getting very much infatuated with
something. I daresay the French mother takes care of that. Why! he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
has scarcely taken any notice of you for this month or more, and
before that you were everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cynthia/Cynthia Kirkpatrick/CYNTHIA</b></font>)</div><p/>It was about six weeks since Cynthia's engagement had become publicly
known, and that might have had something to do with the Squire's
desertion, Molly thought. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Squire has sent me an invitation to go and stay there next week
if you have no objection, mamma. They seem to want a companion for
Mrs. Osborne Hamley, who is not very strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly tell what to say,--I don't like your having to
associate with a Frenchwoman of doubtful rank; and I can't bear the
thought of losing my child--my only daughter now. I did ask Helen
Kirkpatrick, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) can't come for some time; and the house is going
to be altered. Papa has consented to build me another room at last,
for Cynthia and Mr. Henderson will, of course, come and see us;
we shall have many more visitors, I expect, and your bedroom will
make a capital lumber-room; and Maria wants a week's holiday. I am
always so unwilling to put any obstacles in the way of any one's
pleasure,--weakly unwilling, I believe,--but it certainly would be
very convenient to have you out of the house for a few days; so, for
once, I will waive my own wish for your companionship, and plead your
cause with papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brownings/Brownings</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Brownings came to call and hear the double batch of news. Mrs.
Goodenough had called the very day on which they had returned from
Miss Hornblower's, to tell them the astounding fact of Molly Gibson
having gone on a visit to the Towers; not to come back at night, but
to sleep there, to be there for two or three days, just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
was a young lady of quality. So Miss Brownings came to hear all the
details of the wedding from Mrs. Gibson, and the history of Molly's
visit at the Towers as well. But Mrs. Gibson did not like this
divided interest, and some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) old jealousy of Molly's intimacy at
the Towers had returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, <div class="bookquote">``let us hear how you behaved among
the great folks. You must not be set up with all their attention;
remember that they pay it to you for your good father's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly is, I think, quite aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>put in Mrs. Gibson, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) most
soft and languid tone, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) owes her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) privilege of visiting at
such a house to Lady Cumnor's kind desire to set my mind quite at
liberty at the time of Cynthia's marriage. As soon as ever I had
returned home, Molly came back; indeed, I should not have thought
it right to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) intrude upon their kindness beyond what was
absolutely necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly felt extremely uncomfortable at all this, though perfectly
aware of the entire inaccuracy of the statement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but, Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Browning, <div class="bookquote">``never mind whether you went
there on your own merits, or your worthy father's merits, or Mrs.
Gibson's merits; but tell us what you did when you were there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Browning/Miss Phoebe/Phoebe</b></font>)</div><p/>So Molly began an account of their sayings and doings, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
could have made far more interesting to Miss Browning and Miss
Phoebe if she (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) had not been conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) stepmother's critical
listening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) had to tell it all with a mental squint; the surest
way to spoil a narration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) was also subject to Mrs. Gibson's
perpetual corrections of little statements which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) knew to be
facts. But what vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) most of all was Mrs. Gibson's last speech
before the Miss Brownings left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly has fallen into rambling ways with this visit of hers, of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) makes so much, as if nobody had ever been in a great house
but herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is going to Hamley Hall next week,--getting quite
dissipated, in fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet to Mrs. Goodenough, the next caller on the same errand of
congratulation, Mrs. Gibson's tone was quite different. There had
always been a tacit antagonism between the two, and the conversation
now ran as follows:--

<p/>Mrs. Goodenough began,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Mrs. Gibson, I suppose I must wish you joy of Miss Cynthia's
marriage; I should condole with some mothers as had lost their
daughters; but you're not one of that sort, I reckon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, as Mrs. Gibson was not quite sure to which <div class="bookquote">``sort''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>of mothers the
greatest credit was to be attached, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) found it a little difficult
how to frame her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Cynthia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``One can't but rejoice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) happiness!
And yet--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) ended her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sentence by sighing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was a young woman as would always have her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) followers; for,
to tell the truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was as pretty a creature as ever I saw in my
life. And all the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) needed skilful guidance. I'm sure I, for
one, am as glad as can be she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s done so well by herself. Folks say
Mr. Henderson has a handsome private fortune over and above what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)
makes by the law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no fear but that my Cynthia will have everything this world
can give!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson with dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well! she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was always a bit of a favourite of mine; and as I
was saying to my grand-daughter there''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was accompanied by a
young lady, who looked keenly to the prospect of some wedding-cake-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``I was never one of those who ran her (<font color='blue'><b>grand-daughter</b></font>) down and called her (<font color='blue'><b>grand-daughter</b></font>) a flirt
and a jilt. I'm glad to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>grand-daughter</b></font>)'s like to be so well off. And now,
I suppose, you'll be turning your mind to doing something for Miss
Molly there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean by that, doing anything that can, by hastening her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
marriage, deprive me of the company of one who is like my own child,
you are very much mistaken, Mrs. Goodenough. And pray remember,
I am the last person in the world to match-make. Cynthia made Mr.
Henderson's acquaintance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) uncle's in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) cousin was very often ill, and needing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
nursing, and you were very keen she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) should be of use. I'm not saying
but what it's right in a mother; I'm only putting in a word for Miss
Molly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mrs. Goodenough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, half-angry, half-laughing.
<div class="bookquote">``When I want to be married, I'll not trouble mamma. I'll look out for
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly is becoming so popular, I hardly know how we shall keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``I miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sadly; but, as I said to Mr.
Gibson, let young people have change, and see a little of the world
while they are young. It has been a great advantage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) being at
the Towers while so many clever and distinguished people were there.
I can already see a difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tone of conversation: an
elevation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) choice of subjects. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is going to Hamley
Hall. I can assure you I feel quite a proud mother, when I see how
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is sought after. And my other daughter--my Cynthia--writing such
letters from Paris!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things is a deal changed since my days, for sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodenough/Goodenough</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Goodenough. <div class="bookquote">``So, perhaps, I'm no judge. When I was married first, him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
and me went in a postchaise to his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) father's house, a matter of twenty
mile off at the outside; and sate down to as good a supper amongst
his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) friends and relations as you'd wish to see. And that was my first
wedding jaunt. My second was when I better knowed my worth as a
bride, and thought that now or never I must see London. But I were
reckoned a very extravagant sort of a body to go so far, and spend
my money, though Harry had left me uncommon well off. But now young
folks go off to Paris, and think nothing of the cost: and it's well
if wilful waste don't make woeful want before they die. But I'm
thankful somewhat is being done for Miss Molly's chances, as I said
afore. It's not quite what I should have liked to have done for my
Annabella though. But times are changed, as I said just now.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LIX.

<p/>MOLLY GIBSON AT HAMLEY HALL.


<p/>The conversation ended there for the time. Wedding-cake and wine were
brought in, and it was Molly's duty to serve them out. But those last
words of Mrs. Goodenough's tingled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) ears, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) tried to
interpret them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) own satisfaction in any way but the obvious
one. And that, too, was destined to be confirmed; for directly after
Mrs. Goodenough took her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) leave, Mrs. Gibson desired Molly to carry
away the tray to a table close to an open corner window, where the
things might be placed in readiness for any future callers; and
underneath this open window went the path from the house-door to the
road. Molly heard Mrs. Goodenough saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) grand-daughter,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That Mrs. Gibson is a deep `un. There's Mr. Roger Hamley as like as
not to have the Hall estate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sends Molly a-visiting--''  (<font color='red'><b>grand-daughter</b></font>)</div>and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) passed out of hearing. Molly could have burst out crying,
with a full sudden conviction of what Mrs. Goodenough had been
alluding to: her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) sense of the impropriety of Molly's going to visit
at the Hall when Roger was at home. To be sure, Mrs. Goodenough was a
commonplace, unrefined woman. Mrs. Gibson did not seem to have even
noticed the allusion. Mr. Gibson took it all as a matter of course
that Molly should go to the Hall as simply now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had done
before. Roger had spoken of it in so straightforward a manner as
showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had no conception of its being an impropriety,--this
visit,--this visit until now so happy a subject of anticipation.
Molly felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could never speak to any one of the idea to
which Mrs. Goodenough's words had given rise; as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) could never
be the first to suggest the notion of impropriety, which presupposed
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) blushed to think of. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) tried to comfort herself by
reasoning. If it had been wrong, forward, or indelicate, really
improper in the slightest degree, who would have been so ready as her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>)
father to put his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) veto upon it? But reasoning was of no use after
Mrs. Goodenough's words had put fancies into Molly's head. The more
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) bade these fancies begone the more they answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) -LRB-as Daniel
O``Rourke did the man in the moon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rourke</b></font>) bade Dan get off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) seat
on the sickle, and go into empty space-RRB-:--<div class="bookquote">``The more ye ask us the
more we won't stir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel</b></font>)</div>One may smile at a young girl's miseries of this
kind; but they are very real and stinging miseries to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). All that
Molly could do was to resolve on a single eye to the dear old Squire,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mental and bodily comforts; to try and heal up any breaches
which might have occurred between him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) and Aimée; and to ignore Roger
as much as possible. Good Roger! Kind Roger! Dear Roger! It would
be very hard to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as much as was consistent with common
politeness; but it would be right to do it; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must be as natural as possible, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might observe some
difference; but what was natural? How much ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) avoid being with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) even notice if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was more chary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) company, more
calculating of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) words? Alas! the simplicity of their intercourse
was spoilt henceforwards! She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) made laws for herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) resolved
to devote herself to the Squire and to Aimée, and to forget Mrs.
Goodenough's foolish speeches; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) perfect freedom was gone; and
with it half her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) chance--that is to say, half her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) chance would have
been lost over any strangers who had not known her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) before; they would
probably have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) stiff and awkward, and apt to say things
and then retract them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) was so different from her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) usual self
that Roger noticed the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) arrived at the
Hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) had carefully measured out the days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) visit; they were
to be exactly the same number as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) had spent at the Towers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>)
feared lest if she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) stayed at the Hall a shorter time the Squire might
be annoyed. Yet how charming the place looked in its early autumnal
glow as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) drove up! And there was Roger at the hall-door, waiting
to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>), watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) coming. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) retreated,
apparently to summon his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sister-in-law, who came now timidly forwards
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) deep widow's mourning, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) boy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) arms as if to
protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) shyness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) struggled down, and ran towards the
carriage, eager to greet his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friend the coachman, and to obtain a
promised ride. Roger did not say much himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wanted to make
Aimée feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) place as daughter of the house; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) was too timid
to speak much. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) only took Molly by the hand and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) into
the drawing-room, where, as if by a sudden impulse of gratitude for
all the tender nursing she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) had received during her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) illness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) arms round Molly and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) long and well. And after that
they came to be friends.

<p/>It was nearly lunch-time, and the Squire always made his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) appearance
at that meal, more for the pleasure of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) grandson eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
dinner than for any hunger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own. To-day Molly quickly saw the
whole state of the family affairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought that even had Roger
said nothing about them at the Towers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) should have seen that
neither the father nor the daughter-in-law had as yet found the
clue to each other's characters, although they had now been living
for several months in the same house. Aimée seemed to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
English in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) nervousness; and to watch with the jealous eyes of a
dissatisfied mother all the proceedings of the Squire towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
little boy. They were not of the wisest kind, it must be owned; the
child sipped the strong ale with evident relish and clamoured for
everything which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) saw the others enjoying. Aimée could hardly
attend to Molly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) anxiety as to what her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) boy was doing and
eating; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said nothing. Roger took the end of the table
opposite to that at which sat grandfather and grandchild. After the
boy's first wants were gratified the Squire addressed himself to
Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! and so you can come here a-visiting though you have been among
the grand folks. I thought you were going to cut us, Miss Molly, when
I heard you was gone to the Towers. Couldn't find any other place to
stay at while father and mother were away, but an earl's, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They asked me, and I went,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly; <div class="bookquote">``now you've asked me, and
I've come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you might ha' known you'd be always welcome here, without
waiting for asking. Why, Molly! I look upon you as a kind of a
daughter more than Madam there!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) voice a little,
and perhaps supposing that the child's babble would drown the
signification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) words.--<div class="bookquote">``Nay, you needn't look at me so
pitifully, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) doesn't follow English readily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) does!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, in a low voice,--not looking up,
however, for fear of catching another glimpse at Aimée's sudden
forlornness of expression and deepened colour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt grateful,
as if for a personal favour, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) heard Roger speaking to Aimée
the moment afterwards in the tender tones of brotherly friendliness;
and presently these two were sufficiently engaged in a separate
conversation to allow Molly and the Squire to go on talking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>)'s a sturdy chap, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, stroking the little
Roger's curly head. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) can puff four puffs at grandpapa's pipe
without being sick, can't he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I s`ant puff any more puffs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, resolutely. ``Mamma says
``No.<div class="bookquote">'' I s`ant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) voice this time
however. <div class="bookquote">``As if it could do the child any harm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly made a point of turning the conversation from all personal
subjects after this, and kept the Squire talking about the progress
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) drainage during the rest of lunch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) offered to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to
see it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) acceded to the proposal, thinking, meantime, how
little she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) need have anticipated the being thrown too intimately with
Roger, who seemed to devote himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sister-in-law. But, in
the evening, when Aimée had gone upstairs to put her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) boy to bed, and
the Squire was asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) easy-chair, a sudden flush of memory
brought Mrs. Goodenough's words again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) was virtually
tête-à-tête with Roger, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) had been dozens of times before, but
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) could not help assuming an air of constraint; her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) eyes did
not meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in the old frank way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) took up a book at a pause in
the conversation, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) puzzled and annoyed at the change
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) manner. And so it went on during all the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) visit.
If sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) forgot, and let herself go into all her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) old
naturalness, by-and-by she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) checked herself, and became comparatively
cold and reserved. Roger was pained at all this--more pained day
after day; more anxious to discover the cause. Aimée, too, silently
noticed how different Molly became in Roger's presence. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
could not help saying to Molly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like Roger? You would, if you only knew how good he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
is learned, but that is nothing: it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) goodness that one admires
and loves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) long enough to know
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't think him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) agreeable? He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is not like my poor husband,
to be sure; and you knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) well, too. Ah! tell me about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) once
again. When you first knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)? When his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother was alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly had grown very fond of Aimée; when the latter was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ease
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had very charming and attaching ways; but feeling uneasy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
position in the Squire's house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was almost repellent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), too, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) worst side to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). Roger was most anxious to
bring them together, and had several consultations with Molly as to
the best means of accomplishing this end. As long as they talked upon
this subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in the quiet sensible manner which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
inherited from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father; but when their discussions on this point
were ended, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fell back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) piquant assumption of dignified
reserve. It was very difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to maintain this strange
manner, especially when once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fancied that it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
pain; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would go into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own room and suddenly burst into
tears on these occasions, and wish that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) visit was ended, and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was once again in the eventless tranquillity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
home. Yet presently her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fancy changed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) clung to the swiftly
passing hours, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would still retain the happiness of each.
For, unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), Roger was exerting himself to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) visit
pleasant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was not willing to appear as the instigator of all the
little plans for each day, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt as if, somehow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not
hold the same place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) regard as formerly. Still, one day Aimée
suggested a nutting expedition--another day they gave little Roger
the unheard-of pleasure of tea out-of-doors--there was something else
agreeable for a third; and it was Roger who arranged all these simple
pleasures--such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knew Molly would enjoy. But to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) only
appeared as the ready forwarder of Aimée's devices. The week was
nearly gone, when one morning the Squire found Roger sitting in the
old library--with a book before him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), it is true, but so deep in
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was evidently startled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father's unexpected
entrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I should find thee here, my lad! We'll have the old room
done up again before winter; it smells musty enough, and yet I
see it's the place for thee! I want thee to go with me round the
five-acre. I'm thinking of laying it down in grass. It's time for you
to be getting into the fresh air, you look quite wobegone over books,
books, books; there never was a thing like 'em for stealing a man's
health out of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>So Roger went out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father, without saying many words till
they were at some distance from the house. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brought out a
sentence with such abruptness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) repaid his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father for the start
the latter had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) a quarter of an hour before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, you remember I'm going out again to the Cape next month! You
spoke of doing up the library. If it is for me, I shall be away all
the winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you get off it?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>pleaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``I thought maybe you'd
forgotten all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not likely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, half smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but they might have found another man to finish up your work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one can finish it but myself. Besides, an engagement is an
engagement. When I wrote to Lord Hollingford to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hollingford</b></font>) I must come
home, I promised to go out again for another six months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay. I know. And perhaps it will put it out of thy mind. It will
always be hard on me to part from thee. But I daresay it's best for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger's colour deepened. <div class="bookquote">``You are alluding to--to Miss
Kirkpatrick--Mrs. Henderson, I mean. Father, let me tell you once
for all, I think that was rather a hasty affair. I'm pretty sure now
that we were not suited to each other. I was wretched when I got her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)
letter--at the Cape I mean--but I believe it was for the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right. That's my own boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire turning round and
shaking hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son with vehemence. <div class="bookquote">``And now I'll tell you
what I heard the other day, when I was at the magistrates' meeting.
They were all saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) had jilted Preston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to hear anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) may have her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) faults,
but I can never forget how I once loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well! Perhaps it's right. I was not so bad about it, was I,
Roger? Poor Osborne need not ha' been so secret with me. I asked your
Miss Cynthia out here--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother and all--my bark is worse than
my bite. For, if I had a wish on earth, it was to see Osborne married
as befitted one of an old stock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went and chose out this
French girl, of no family at all, only a--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was; look at what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is! I wonder you are not
more taken with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) humility and sweetness, father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't even call her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire uneasily, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
dreaded a repetition of the arguments which Roger had often used to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) give Aimée her (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) proper due of affection and position. <div class="bookquote">``Now
your Miss Cynthia was pretty, I will say that for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), the baggage!
And to think that when you two lads flew right in your father's face,
and picked out girls below you in rank and family, you should neither
of you have set your fancies on my little Molly there. I daresay I
should ha' been angry enough at the time, but the lassie would ha'
found her (<font color='blue'><b>lassie</b></font>) way to my heart, as never this French lady, nor t' other
one, could ha' done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why you mightn't put up for her (<font color='blue'><b>lassie</b></font>) still. I'm humble enough
now, and you're not heir as Osborne was who married a servant-maid.
Don't you think you could turn your thoughts upon Molly Gibson,
Roger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, shortly. <div class="bookquote">``It's too late--too late. Don't let us
talk any more of my marrying. Isn't this the five-acre field?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was discussing the relative values of meadow, arable and
pasture land with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father, as heartily as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had never known
Molly, or loved Cynthia. But the squire was not in such good spirits,
and went but heavily into the discussion. At the end of it he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) said
àpropos de bottes,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't you think you could like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) if you tried, Roger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger knew perfectly well to what his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father was alluding, but for
an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was on the point of pretending to misunderstand. At
length, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said, in a low voice,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never try, father. Don't let us talk any more about it. As
I said before, it's too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire was like a child to whom some toy has been refused;
from time to time the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) disappointment in this matter
recurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mind; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) took to blaming Cynthia as the
primary cause of Roger's present indifference to womankind.

<p/>It so happened that on Molly's last morning at the Hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) received
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) first letter from Cynthia--Mrs. Henderson. It was just before
breakfast-time; Roger was out of doors, Aimée had not as yet come
down; Molly was alone in the dining-room, where the table was already
laid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had just finished reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) letter when the Squire came
in, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) immediately and joyfully told him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) what the morning had
brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw the Squire's face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could have
bitten her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tongue out for having named Cynthia's name to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
looked vexed and depressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I might never hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) again--I do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)'s been the bane
of my Roger, that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) has. I haven't slept half the night,
and it's all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) fault. Why, there's my boy saying now that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has
no heart for ever marrying, poor lad! I wish it had been you, Molly,
my lads had taken a fancy for. I told Roger so t`other day, and
I said that for all you were beneath what I ever thought to see
them marry,--well--it's of no use--it's too late, now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said.
Only never let me hear that baggage's name again, that's all, and
no offence to you either, lassie. I know you love the wench; but
if you'll take an old man's word, you're worth a score of her (<font color='blue'><b>lassie</b></font>). I
wish young men would think so too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) muttered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) went to the
side-table to carve the ham, while Molly poured out the tea--her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
heart very hot all the time, and effectually silenced for a space.
It was with the greatest difficulty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could keep tears of
mortification from falling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) felt altogether in a wrong position
in that house, which had been like a home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) until this last
visit. What with Mrs. Goodenough's remarks, and now this speech of
the Squire's, implying--at least to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) susceptible imagination--that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father had proposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) as a wife to Roger, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) had been
rejected--she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) was more glad than she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) could express, or even think,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) was going home this very morning. Roger came in from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
walk while she (<font color='blue'><b>Goodenough</b></font>) was in this state of feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) saw in an instant
that something had distressed Molly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) longed to have the old
friendly right of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) what it was. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had effectually
kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) at too great a distance during the last few days for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to
feel at liberty to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) in the old straightforward brotherly
way; especially now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) efforts to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
feelings, and the way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) drank her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tea in feverish haste,
and accepted bread only to crumble it about her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) plate, untouched. It
was all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could do to make talk under these circumstances; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) backed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) efforts as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could until Aimée came down,
grave and anxious: her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) boy had not had a good night, and did not seem
well; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had fallen into a feverish sleep now, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could not have
left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Immediately the whole table was in a ferment. The Squire
pushed away his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) plate, and could eat no more; Roger was trying
to extract a detail or a fact out of Aimée, who began to give
way to tears. Molly quickly proposed that the carriage, which
had been ordered to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) home at eleven, should come round
immediately--she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had everything ready packed up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said,--and
bring back her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father at once. By leaving directly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, it was
probable they might catch him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) morning
visits in the town, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had set off on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more distant
round. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) proposal was agreed to, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went upstairs to put on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came down all ready into the drawing-room, expecting
to find Aimée and the Squire there; but during her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) absence word had
been brought to the anxious mother and grandfather that the child had
wakened up in a panic, and both had rushed up to their darling. But
Roger was in the drawing-room awaiting Molly, with a large bunch of
the choicest flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was on the point of leaving the room
again, on finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) there alone. <div class="bookquote">``I gathered these flowers for you
before breakfast.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) reluctant advance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are very kind. I am very much obliged to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must do something for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), determined not to
notice the restraint of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) manner, and making the re-arrangement of
the flowers which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) held a sort of link between them, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
could not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) impulse, and leave the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,--honestly as I know you will if you speak at all,--haven't
I done something to vex you since we were so happy at the Towers
together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice was so kind and true,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) manner so winning yet wistful,
that Molly would have been thankful to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) believed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could have helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) more than any one to understand how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
ought to behave rightly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would have disentangled her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fancies,--if
only he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) himself had not lain at the very core and centre of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
perplexity and dismay. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) of Mrs. Goodenough's
words troubling her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) maiden modesty? How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ever repeat what
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father had said that morning, and assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), no more
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), wished that their old friendliness should be troubled by the
thought of a nearer relationship?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you never vexed me in my whole life, Roger,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), looking
straight at him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) for the first time for many days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you, because you say so. I have no right to ask further.
Molly, will you give me back one of those flowers, as a pledge of
what you have said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take whichever you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), eagerly offering him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the whole
nosegay to choose from.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you must choose, and you must give it me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>Just then the Squire came in. Roger would have been glad if Molly had
not gone on so eagerly to ransack the bunch for the choicest flower
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father's presence; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) exclaimed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, Mr. Hamley, do you know which is Roger's favourite
flower?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. A rose, I daresay. The carriage is at the door, and, Molly my
dear, I don't want to hurry you, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I know. Here, Roger,--here is a rose!

<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``And red as a rose was she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>).'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>I will find papa as soon as ever I get home. How is the little boy?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s beginning of some kind of a fever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Squire/Squire Hamley/Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>And the Squire took her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to the carriage, talking all the way of the
little boy; Roger following, and hardly heeding what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was doing in
the answer to the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) kept asking himself: <div class="bookquote">``Too late--or not?
Can she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ever forget that my first foolish love was given to one so
different?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), as the carriage rolled away, kept saying to herself,--<div class="bookquote">``We
are friends again. I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will remember what the dear
Squire took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) head to suggest for many days. It is so
pleasant to be on the old terms again! and what lovely flowers!''




 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LX.

<p/>ROGER HAMLEY``S CONFESSION.


<p/>Roger had a great deal to think of as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) turned away from looking
after the carriage as long as it could be seen. The day before,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had believed that Molly had come to view all the symptoms of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) growing love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),--symptoms which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thought had been so
patent,--as disgusting inconstancy to the inconstant Cynthia; that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had felt that an attachment which could be so soon transferred to
another was not worth having; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had desired to mark all
this by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) changed treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and so to nip it in the bud.
But this morning her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) old sweet, frank manner had returned--in their
last interview, at any rate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) puzzled himself hard to find out what
could have distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) at breakfast-time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) even went so far as
to ask Robinson whether Miss Gibson had received any letters that
morning; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had had one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) tried to believe
that the letter was in some way the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) sorrow. So far
so good. They were friends again after their unspoken difference;
but that was not enough for Roger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt every day more and more
certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) alone, could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had felt
this, and had partly given up all hope, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) father had been
urging upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the very course he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) most desired to take. No need for
<div class="bookquote">``trying''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) said to himself,--that was already done. And
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) was very jealous on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) behalf. Was that love worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
which had once been given to Cynthia? Was not this affair too much
a mocking mimicry of the last--again just on the point of leaving
England for a considerable time--if he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) now to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own
home,--in the very drawing-room where he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) had once offered to Cynthia?
And then by a strong resolve he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) determined on this course. They
were friends now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) kissed the rose that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) pledge of
friendship. If he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) went to Africa, he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) ran some deadly chances; he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) knew
better what they were now than he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) had done when he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) went before. Until
his (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) return he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) would not even attempt to win more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) love than
he (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) already had. But once safe home again, no weak fancies as to
what might or might not be her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) answer should prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) running
all chances to gain the woman who was to him (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) the one who excelled
all. His (<font color='blue'><b>HAMLEY</b></font>) was not the poor vanity that thinks more of the possible
mortification of a refusal than of the precious jewel of a bride that
may be won. Somehow or another, please God to send him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) back safe, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
would put his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fate to the touch. And till then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would be patient.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was no longer a boy to rush at the coveted object; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a man
capable of judging and abiding.

<p/>Molly sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) could find him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), to the Hall;
and then sate down to the old life in the home drawing-room, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) missed Cynthia's bright presence at every turn. Mrs. Gibson was
in rather a querulous mood, which fastened itself upon the injury of
Cynthia's letter being addressed to Molly, and not to herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Considering all the trouble I had with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) trousseau, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
might have written to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) did--her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) first letter was to you, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
real thoughts still intent upon the Hall--upon the sick child--upon
Roger, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) begging for the flower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, just a first letter, three pages long, with an account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
crossing; while to you she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) can write about fashions, and how the
bonnets are worn in Paris, and all sorts of interesting things. But
poor mothers must never expect confidential letters, I have found
that out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may see my letter, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, <div class="bookquote">``there is really nothing
in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) writing, and crossing to you who don't value it,
while my poor heart is yearning after my lost child! Really, life is
somewhat hard to bear at times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there was silence--for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do tell me something about your visit, Molly. Is Roger very
heart-broken? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) talk much about Cynthia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) does not mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) often; hardly ever, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had much feeling. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would not
have let her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) go so easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could help it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was already engaged to Mr. Henderson--he (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) had come down
that very day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, with perhaps more heat than the occasion
required.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor head!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hands up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``One may see you've been stopping with people of robust health,
and--excuse my saying it, Molly, of your friends--of unrefined
habits, you've got to talk in so loud a voice. But do remember my
head, Molly. So Roger has quite forgotten Cynthia, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)? Oh! what
inconstant creatures men are! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will be falling in love with some
grandee next, mark my words! They are making a pet and a lion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s just the kind of weak young man to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head turned by
it all; and to propose to some fine lady of rank, who would no more
think of marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) than of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) footman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it is likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``Roger is too
sensible for anything of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just the fault I always found with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); sensible and
cold-hearted! Now, that's a kind of character which may be very
valuable, but which revolts me. Give me warmth of heart, even with a
little of that extravagance of feeling which misleads the judgment,
and conducts into romance. Poor Mr. Kirkpatrick! That was just
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) character. I used to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) love for me was quite
romantic. I think I have told you about his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) walking five miles in the
rain to get me a muffin once when I was ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly. <div class="bookquote">``It was very kind of him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So imprudent, too! Just what one of your sensible, cold-hearted,
commonplace people would never have thought of doing. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) cough
and all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) didn't suffer for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>replied Molly, anxious at any
cost to keep off the subject of the Hamleys, upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
stepmother always disagreed, and on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) found it difficult to
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) did! I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>) ever got over the cold he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>)
caught that day. I wish you had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Kirkpatrick</b></font>), Molly. I sometimes wonder
what would have happened if you had been my real daughter, and
Cynthia dear papa's, and Mr. Kirkpatrick and your own dear mother had
all lived. People talk a good deal about natural affinities. It would
have been a question for a philosopher.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) began to think on the
impossibilities she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder how the poor little boy is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, after a pause,
speaking out her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little child! When one thinks how little his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prolonged
existence is to be desired, one feels that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) death would be a
boon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma! what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly, much shocked. <div class="bookquote">``Why, every one
cares for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life as the most precious thing! You have never seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is the bonniest, sweetest little fellow that can be! What do
you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought that the Squire would have desired a
better-born heir than the offspring of a servant,--with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) ideas
about descent and blood and family. And I should have thought that it
was a little mortifying to Roger--who must naturally have looked upon
himself as his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brother's heir--to find a little interloping child,
half French, half English, stepping into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) shoes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know how fond they are of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),--the Squire looks upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
as the apple of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Molly! Molly! pray don't let me hear you using such vulgar
expressions. When shall I teach you true refinement--that refinement
which consists in never even thinking a vulgar, commonplace thing!
Proverbs and idioms are never used by people of education. ``Apple of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) eye!<div class="bookquote">'' I am really shocked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mamma, I'm very sorry; but after all, what I wanted to say
as strongly as I could was, that the Squire loves the little boy as
much as his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own child; and that Roger--oh! what a shame to think that
Roger--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stopped suddenly short, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were choked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder at your indignation, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson.
<div class="bookquote">``It is just what I should have felt at your age. But one learns the
baseness of human nature with advancing years. I was wrong, though,
to undeceive you so early--but depend upon it, the thought I alluded
to has crossed Roger Hamley's mind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All sorts of thoughts cross one's mind--it depends upon whether one
gives them harbour and encouragement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, if you must have the last word, don't let it be a truism.
But let us talk on some more interesting subject. I asked Cynthia to
buy me a silk gown in Paris, and I said I would send her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) word what
colour I fixed upon--I think dark blue is the most becoming to my
complexion; what do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly agreed, sooner than take the trouble of thinking about the
thing at all; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was far too full of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) silent review of all the
traits in Roger's character which had lately come under her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) notice,
and that gave the lie direct to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stepmother's supposition. Just
then they heard Mr. Gibson's step downstairs. But it was some time
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) entrance into the room where they were sitting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is little Roger?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beginning with scarlet fever, I'm afraid. It's well you left when
you did, Molly. You've never had it. We must stop up all intercourse
with the Hall for a time. If there's one illness I dread, it is
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you go and come back to us, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But I always take plenty of precautions. However, no need to
talk about risks that lie in the way of one's duty. It is unnecessary
risks that we must avoid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) have it badly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>asked Molly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell. I shall do my best for the wee laddie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Whenever Mr. Gibson's feelings were touched, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was apt to recur to
the language of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) youth. Molly knew now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was much interested
in the case.

<p/>For some days there was imminent danger to the little boy; for some
weeks there was a more chronic form of illness to contend with; but
when the immediate danger was over and the warm daily interest was
past, Molly began to realize that, from the strict quarantine her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father evidently thought it necessary to establish between the two
houses, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was not likely to see Roger again before his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) departure
for Africa. Oh! if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had but made more of the uncared-for days that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had passed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) at the Hall! Worse than uncared for; days on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had avoided him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); refused to converse freely with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pain by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) change of manner; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had read in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes, heard
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been perplexed and pained, and now her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
imagination dwelt on and exaggerated the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tones and
looks.

<p/>One evening after dinner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) father said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As the country-people say, I've done a stroke of work to-day. Roger
Hamley and I have laid our heads together, and we've made a plan by
which Mrs. Osborne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) boy will leave the Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I say the other day, Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson,
interrupting, and giving Molly a look of extreme intelligence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And go into lodgings at Jennings' farm; not four hundred yards from
the Park-field gate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Gibson. <div class="bookquote">``The Squire and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
daughter-in-law have got to be much better friends over the little
fellow's sick-bed; and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) sees now how impossible it would
be for the mother to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child, and go and be happy in France,
which has been the notion running in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) head all this time. To buy
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) off, in fact. But that one night, when I was very uncertain
whether I could bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) through, they took to crying together,
and condoling with each other; and it was just like tearing down a
curtain that had been between them; they have been rather friends
than otherwise ever since. Still Roger'' (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>---LRB-Molly's cheeks grew warm
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes soft and bright; it was such a pleasure to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>)
name-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``and I both agree that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother knows much better how to
manage the boy than his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) grandfather does. I suppose that was the
one good thing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got from that hard-hearted mistress of hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
certainly has been well trained in the management of children. And
it makes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) impatient, and annoyed, and unhappy, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sees
the Squire giving the child nuts and ale, and all sorts of silly
indulgences, and spoiling him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) in every possible way. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s a
coward, and doesn't speak out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind. Now by being in lodgings, and
having her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own servants--nice pretty rooms they are, too; we went to
see them, and Mrs. Jennings promises to attend well to Mrs. Osborne
Hamley, and is very much honoured, and all that sort of thing--not
ten minutes' walk from the Hall, too, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) and the little chap
may easily go backwards and forwards as often as they like, and yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) may keep the control over the child's discipline and diet. In
short, I think I've done a good day's work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) continued, stretching
himself a little; and then with a shake rousing himself, and making
ready to go out again, to see a patient who had sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
absence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good day's work!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) repeated to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) ran downstairs.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know when I have been so happy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had not told Molly
all that had passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) and Roger. Roger had begun a fresh
subject of conversation just as Mr. Gibson was hastening away from
the Hall, after completing the new arrangement for Aimée and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that I set off next Tuesday, Mr. Gibson, don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said
Roger, a little abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. I hope you'll be as successful in all your scientific
objects as you were the last time, and have no sorrows awaiting you
when you come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Yes. I hope so. You don't think there's any danger of
infection now, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! If the disease were to spread through the household, I think
we should have had some signs of it before now. One is never sure,
remember, with scarlet fever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger was silent for a minute or two. <div class="bookquote">``Should you be afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said
at length, <div class="bookquote">``of seeing me at your house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; but I think I would rather decline the pleasure of your
society there at present. It's only three weeks or a month since
the child began. Besides, I shall be over here again before you go.
I'm always on my guard against symptoms of dropsy. I have known it
supervene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall not see Molly again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, in a tone and with a
look of great disappointment.

<p/>Mr. Gibson turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) keen, observant eyes upon the young man, and
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) in as penetrating a manner as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) had been beginning
with an unknown illness. Then the doctor and the father compressed
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lips and gave vent to a long intelligent whistle. <div class="bookquote">``Whew!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).

<p/>Roger's bronzed cheeks took a deeper shade.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will take a message to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) from me, won't you? A message of
farewell?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I. I'm not going to be a message-carrier between any young man
and young woman. I'll tell my womenkind I forbade you to come near
the house, and that you're sorry to go away without bidding good-by.
That's all I shall say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do not disapprove?--I see you guess why. Oh! Mr. Gibson,
just speak to me one word of what must be in your heart, though you
are pretending not to understand why I would give worlds to see Molly
again before I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gibson, more affected than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) liked to show,
and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand on Roger's shoulder. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pulled himself up,
and said gravely enough,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind, Molly is not Cynthia. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were to care for you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is not
one who could transfer her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) love to the next comer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean not as readily as I have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>replied Roger. <div class="bookquote">``I only wish
you could know what a different feeling this is to my boyish love for
Cynthia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't thinking of you when I spoke; but, however, as I might have
remembered afterwards that you were not a model of constancy, let us
hear what you have to say for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much. I did love Cynthia very much. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) manners and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) beauty
bewitched me; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) letters,--short, hurried letters,--sometimes
showing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) really hadn't taken the trouble to read mine
through,--I cannot tell you the pain they gave me! Twelve months'
solitude, in frequent danger of one's life--face to face with
death--sometimes ages a man like many years' experience. Still I
longed for the time when I should see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sweet face again, and hear
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) speak. Then the letter at the Cape!--and still I hoped. But you
know how I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), when I went to have the interview which I
trusted might end in the renewal of our relations,--engaged to Mr.
Henderson. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) walking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) in your garden, coquetting with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) about a flower, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) used to do with me. I can see the
pitying look in Molly's eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) watched me; I can see it now. And
I could beat myself for being such a blind fool as to-- What must she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
think of me? how she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) must despise me, choosing the false Duessa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come! Cynthia isn't so bad as that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)'s a very fascinating,
faulty creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know! I know! I will never allow any one to say a word against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). If I called her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) the false Duessa it was because I wanted to
express my sense of the difference between her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) and Molly as strongly
as I could. You must allow for a lover's exaggeration. Besides, all I
wanted to say was,--Do you think that Molly, after seeing and knowing
that I had loved a person so inferior to herself, could ever be
brought to listen to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I can't tell. And even if I could, I wouldn't. Only if
it's any comfort to you, I may say what my experience has taught me.
Women are queer, unreasoning creatures, and are just as likely as not
to love a man who has been throwing away his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I see you mean to
give me encouragement. And I had resolved never to give Molly a hint
of what I felt till I returned,--and then to try and win her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) by every
means in my power. I determined not to repeat the former scene in the
former place,--in your drawing-room,--however I might be tempted. And
perhaps, after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) avoided me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was here last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Roger, I've listened to you long enough. If you've nothing
better to do with your time than to talk about my daughter, I have.
When you come back it will be time enough to inquire how far your
father would approve of such an engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) himself urged it upon me the other day--but then I was in
despair--I thought it was too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what means you are likely to have of maintaining a wife?--I
always thought that point was passed too lightly over when you formed
your hurried engagement to Cynthia. I'm not mercenary,--Molly has
some money independently of me,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) by the way knows nothing
of,--not much;--and I can allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) something. But all these things
must be left till your return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you sanction my attachment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by sanctioning it. I can't help it. I
suppose losing one's daughter is a necessary evil. Still'' (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>--seeing the
disappointed expression on Roger's face--<div class="bookquote">``it is but fair to you to
say, I'd rather give my child,--my only child, remember!--to you,
than to any man in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger, shaking hands with Mr. Gibson, almost
against the will of the latter. <div class="bookquote">``And I may see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), just once, before
I go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly not. There I come in as doctor as well as father. No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will take a message, at any rate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To my wife and to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) conjointly. I will not separate them. I will
not in the slightest way be a go-between.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Hamley/Mr. Roger Hamley</b></font>)</div>said Roger. <div class="bookquote">``Tell them both as strongly as you can how
I regret your prohibition. I see I must submit. But if I don't come
back, I'll haunt you for having been so cruel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, I like that. Give me a wise man of science in love! No one
beats him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in folly. Good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by. You will see Molly this afternoon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. And you will see your father. But I don't heave such
portentous sighs at the thought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gibson/MR. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gibson gave Roger's message to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) wife and to Molly that evening
at dinner. It was but what the latter had expected, after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
father had said of the very great danger of infection; but now that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) expectation came in the shape of a final decision, it took away
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) appetite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) submitted in silence; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) observant father
noticed that after this speech of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only played with the food
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) plate, and concealed a good deal of it under her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knife and
fork.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lover _versus_ father!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), half sadly. <div class="bookquote">``Lover wins.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), too, became indifferent to all that remained of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dinner. Mrs.
Gibson pattered on; and nobody listened.

<p/>The day of Roger's departure came. Molly tried hard to forget it
in working away at a cushion she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was preparing as a present to
Cynthia; people did worsted-work in those days. One, two, three. One,
two, three, four, five, six, seven; all wrong: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was thinking of
something else, and had to unpick it. It was a rainy day, too; and
Mrs. Gibson, who had planned to go out and pay some calls, had to
stay indoors. This made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) restless and fidgety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) kept going
backwards and forwards to different windows in the drawing-room to
look at the weather, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) imagined that while it rained at one
window, it might be fine weather at another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly--come here! who is that man wrapped up in a
cloak,--there,--near the Park wall, under the beech-tree--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been
there this half-hour and more, never stirring, and looking at this
house all the time! I think it's very suspicious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div><p/>Molly looked, and in an instant recognized Roger under all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wraps.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) first instinct was to draw back. The next to come forwards, and
say--<div class="bookquote">``Why, mamma, it's Roger Hamley! Look now--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) hand;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)'s wishing us good-by in the only way he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) can!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) responded
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sign; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was not sure if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) modest quiet
movement, for Mrs. Gibson became immediately so demonstrative that
Molly fancied that her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eager foolish pantomimic motions must absorb
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I call this so attentive of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gibson, in the midst of
a volley of kisses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Really, it is quite romantic. It
reminds me of former days--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) will be too late! I must send him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)
away; it is half-past twelve!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) watch and held it
up, tapping it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) forefinger, and occupying the very centre of
the window. Molly could only peep here and there, dodging now up, now
down, now on this side, now on that, of the perpetually-moving arms.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) saw something of a corresponding movement on Roger's
part. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went away slowly, slowly, and often looking back,
in spite of the tapped watch. Mrs. Gibson at last retreated, and
Molly quietly moved into her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) place to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) figure once more before
the turn of the road hid it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) view. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), too, knew where the
last glimpse of Mr. Gibson's house was to be obtained, and once more
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) turned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) white handkerchief floated in the air. Molly waved
hers high up, with eager longing that it should be seen. And then,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) was gone! and Molly returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) worsted-work, happy, glowing,
sad, content, and thinking to herself how sweet is--friendship!

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) came to a sense of the present, Mrs. Gibson was saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, though Roger Hamley has never been a great favourite
of mine, this little attention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) has reminded me very forcibly
of a very charming young man--a _soupirant_, as the French would call
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>)--Lieutenant Harper--you must have heard me speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>), Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gibson/MRS. GIBSON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>said Molly, absently.

<p/>``Well, you remember how devoted he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) was to me when I was at Mrs.
Duncombe's, my first situation, and I only seventeen. And when the
recruiting party was ordered to another town, poor Mr. Harper came
and stood opposite the schoolroom window for nearly an hour, and I
know it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) doing that the band played ``The girl I left behind
me,<div class="bookquote">'' when they marched out the next day. Poor Mr. Harper! It was
before I knew dear Mr. Kirkpatrick! Dear me. How often my poor heart
has had to bleed in this life of mine! not but what dear papa is a
very worthy man, and makes me very happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would spoil me, indeed,
if I would let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not as rich as Mr. Henderson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>That last sentence contained the germ of Mrs. Gibson's present
grievance. Having married Cynthia, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mother put it--taking
credit to herself as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) had had the principal part in the
achievement--she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) now became a little envious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) daughter's good
fortune in being the wife of a young, handsome, rich, and moderately
fashionable man, who lived in London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) naïvely expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>)
feelings on this subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) husband one day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was really
not feeling quite well, and when consequently her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) annoyances were
much more present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) mind than her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sources of happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is such a pity!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I was born when I was. I should
so have liked to belong to this generation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's sometimes my own feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``So many new views seem
to be opened in science, that I should like, if it were possible, to
live till their reality was ascertained, and one saw what they led
to. But I don't suppose that's your reason, my dear, for wishing to
be twenty or thirty years younger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. And I did not put it in that hard unpleasant way; I only
said I should like to belong to this generation. To tell the truth,
I was thinking of Cynthia. Without vanity, I believe I was as pretty
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) is--when I was a girl, I mean; I had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) dark eyelashes,
but then my nose was straighter. And now look at the difference! I
have to live in a little country town with three servants, and no
carriage; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) inferior good looks will live in Sussex
Place, and keep a man and a brougham, and I don't know what. But the
fact is, in this generation there are so many more rich young men
than there were when I was a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ho! so that's your reason, is it, my dear? If you had been young
now you might have married somebody as well off as Walter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I think that was my idea. Of course I should have

<p/>CONCLUDING REMARKS:

<p/>-LSB-By the Editor of _The Cornhill Magazine_.-RSB-


<p/>Here the story is broken off, and it can never be finished. What
promised to be the crowning work of a life is a memorial of death. A
few days longer, and it would have been a triumphal column, crowned
with a capital of festal leaves and flowers: now it is another sort
of column--one of those sad white pillars which stand broken in the
churchyard.

<p/>But if the work is not quite complete, little remains to be added
to it, and that little has been distinctly reflected into our minds.
We know that Roger Hamley will marry Molly, and that is what we are
most concerned about. Indeed, there was little else to tell. Had the
writer lived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hero back to Africa forthwith;
and those scientific parts of Africa are a long way from Hamley; and
there is not much to choose between a long distance and a long time.
How many hours are there in twenty-four when you are all alone in
a desert place, a thousand miles from the happiness which might be
yours to take--if you were there to take it? How many, when from the
sources of the Topinambo your heart flies back ten times a day, like
a carrier-pigeon, to the one only source of future good for you, and
ten times a day returns with its message undelivered? Many more than
are counted on the calendar. So Roger found. The days were weeks that
separated him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) from the time when Molly gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) a certain little
flower, and months from the time which divorced him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) from Cynthia,
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had begun to doubt before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knew for certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) was
never much worth hoping for. And if such were his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) days, what was
the slow procession of actual weeks and months in those remote and
solitary places? They were like years of a stay-at-home life, with
liberty and leisure to see that nobody was courting Molly meanwhile.
The effect of this was, that long before the term of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) engagement
was ended all that Cynthia had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was departed from Roger's
mind, and all that Molly was and might be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) filled it full.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) returned; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) saw Molly again he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) remembered that to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) absence might not have seemed so long, and
was oppressed with the old dread that she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would think him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) fickle.
Therefore this young gentleman, so self-reliant and so lucid in
scientific matters, found it difficult after all to tell Molly how
much he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); and might have blundered if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had not
thought of beginning by showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) the flower that was plucked from
the nosegay. How charmingly that scene would have been drawn, had
Mrs. Gaskell lived to depict it, we can only imagine: that it _would_
have been charming--especially in what Molly did, and looked, and
said--we know.

<p/>Roger and Molly are married; and if one of them is happier than
the other, it is Molly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband has no need to draw upon the
little fortune which is to go to poor Osborne's boy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) becomes
professor at some great scientific institution, and wins his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way in
the world handsomely. The squire is almost as happy in this marriage
as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) son. If any one suffers for it, it is Mr. Gibson. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibson</b></font>) takes
a partner, so as to get a chance of running up to London to stay with
Molly for a few days now and then, and <div class="bookquote">``to get a little rest from
Mrs. Gibson.''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Gibson/Molly Gibson</b></font>)</div>Of what was to happen to Cynthia after her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) marriage the
author was not heard to say much; and, indeed, it does not seem that
anything needs to be added. One little anecdote, however, was told
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) by Mrs. Gaskell, which is very characteristic. One day, when
Cynthia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) husband were on a visit to Hollingford, Mr. Henderson
learned for the first time, through an innocent casual remark of
Mr. Gibson's, that the famous traveller, Roger Hamley, was known to
the family. Cynthia had never happened to mention it. How well that
little incident, too, would have been described!

<p/>But it is useless to speculate upon what would have been done by the
delicate strong hand which can create no more Molly Gibsons--no more
Roger Hamleys. We have repeated, in this brief note, all that is
known of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) designs for the story, which would have been completed
in another chapter. There is not so much to regret, then, so far as
this novel is concerned; indeed, the regrets of those who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
are less for the loss of the novelist than of the woman--one of the
kindest and wisest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) time. But yet, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) own sake _as_ a
novelist alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) untimely death is a matter for deep regret. It is
clear in this novel of _Wives and Daughters_, in the exquisite little
story that preceded it, _Cousin Phillis_, and in _Sylvia's Lovers_,
that Mrs. Gaskell had within these five years started upon a new
career with all the freshness of youth, and with a mind which seemed
to have put off its clay and to have been born again. But that <div class="bookquote">``put
off its clay''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>must be taken in a very narrow sense. All minds are
tinctured more or less with the <div class="bookquote">``muddy vesture''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gaskell</b></font>)</div>in which they are
contained; but few minds ever showed less of base earth than Mrs.
Gaskell's. It was so at all times; but lately even the original
slight tincture seemed to disappear. While you read any one of the
last three books we have named, you feel yourself caught out of an
abominable wicked world, crawling with selfishness and reeking with
base passions, into one where there is much weakness, many mistakes,
sufferings long and bitter, but where it is possible for people to
live calm and wholesome lives; and, what is more, you feel that this
is at least as real a world as the other. The kindly spirit which
thinks no ill looks out of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pages irradiate; and while we read
them, we breathe the purer intelligence which prefers to deal with
emotions and passions which have a living root in minds within the
pale of salvation, and not with those which rot without it. This
spirit is more especially declared in _Cousin Phillis_ and _Wives and
Daughters_--their author's latest works; they seem to show that for
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) the end of life was not descent amongst the clods of the valley,
but ascent into the purer air of the heaven-aspiring hills.

<p/>We are saying nothing now of the merely intellectual qualities
displayed in these later works. Twenty years to come, that may be
thought the more important question of the two; in the presence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) grave we cannot think so; but it is true, all the same, that
as mere works of art and observation, these later novels of Mrs.
Gaskell's are among the finest of our time. There is a scene in
_Cousin Phyllis_--where Holman, making hay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holman</b></font>) men, ends the
day with a psalm--which is not excelled as a picture in all modern
fiction; and the same may be said of that chapter of this last story
in which Roger smokes a pipe with the Squire after the quarrel with
Osborne. There is little in either of these scenes, or in a score
of others which succeed each other like gems in a cabinet, which
the ordinary novel-maker could <div class="bookquote">``seize.''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>There is no <div class="bookquote">``material''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>for
_him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)_ in half-a-dozen farming men singing hymns in a field, or a
discontented old gentleman smoking tobacco with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) son. Still less
could he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) avail himself of the miseries of a little girl sent to
be happy in a fine house full of fine people; but it is just in
such things as these that true genius appears brightest and most
unapproachable. It is the same with the personages in Mrs. Gaskell's
works. Cynthia is one of the most difficult characters which have
ever been attempted in our time. Perfect art always obscures the
difficulties it overcomes; and it is not till we try to follow the
processes by which such a character as the Tito of _Romola_ is
created, for instance, that we begin to understand what a marvellous
piece of work it is. To be sure, Cynthia was not so difficult, nor is
it nearly so great a creation as that splendid achievement of art and
thought--of the rarest art, of the profoundest thought. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) also
belongs to the kind of characters which are conceived only in minds
large, clear, harmonious and just, and which can be portrayed fully
and without flaw only by hands obedient to the finest motions of the
mind. Viewed in this light, Cynthia is a more important piece of work
even than Molly, delicately as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) is drawn, and true and harmonious
as that picture is also. And what we have said of Cynthia may be
said with equal truth of Osborne Hamley. The true delineation of a
character like that is as fine a test of art as the painting of a
foot or a hand, which also seems so easy, and in which perfection is
most rare. In this case the work is perfect. Mrs. Gaskell has drawn
a dozen characters more striking than Osborne since she (<font color='blue'><b>Osborne</b></font>) wrote _Mary
Barton_, but not one which shows more exquisite finish.

<p/>Another thing we may be permitted to notice, because it has a great
and general significance. It may be true that this is not exactly
the place for criticism, but since we are writing of Osborne Hamley,
we cannot resist pointing out a peculiar instance of the subtler
conceptions which underlie all really considerable works. Here are
Osborne and Roger, two men who, in every particular that can be
seized for _description_, are totally different creatures. Body and
mind they are quite unlike. They have different tastes; they take
different ways: they are men of two sorts which, in the society
sense, never <div class="bookquote">``know''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>each other; and yet, never did brotherly blood
run more manifest than in the veins of those two. To make that
manifest without allowing the effort to peep out for a single moment,
would be a triumph of art; but it is a <div class="bookquote">``touch beyond the reach of
art''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to make their likeness in unlikeness so natural a thing that we
no more wonder about it than we wonder at seeing the fruit and the
bloom on the same bramble: we have always seen them there together in
blackberry season, and do not wonder about it nor think about it at
all. Inferior writers, even some writers who are highly accounted,
would have revelled in the <div class="bookquote">``contrast,''  (<font color='red'><b>some writers</b></font>)</div>persuaded that they were
doing a fine anatomical dramatic thing by bringing it out at every
opportunity. To the author of _Wives and Daughters_ this sort of
anatomy was mere dislocation. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) began by having the people of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
story born in the usual way, and not built up like the Frankenstein
monster; and thus when Squire Hamley took a wife, it was then
provided that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamley</b></font>) two boys should be as naturally one and diverse as
the fruit and the bloom on the bramble. <div class="bookquote">``It goes without speaking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Squire</b></font>)</div>These differences are precisely what might have been expected
from the union of Squire Hamley with the town-bred, refined,
delicate-minded woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) married; and the affection of the young
men, their kindness -LRB-to use the word in its old and new meanings at
once-RRB- is nothing but a reproduction of those impalpable threads of
love which bound the equally diverse father and mother in bonds
faster than the ties of blood.

<p/>But we will not permit ourselves to write any more in this vein. It
is unnecessary to demonstrate to those who know what is and what
is not true literature that Mrs. Gaskell was gifted with some of
the choicest faculties bestowed upon mankind; that these grew into
greater strength and ripened into greater beauty in the decline of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gaskell</b></font>) days; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gaskell</b></font>) has gifted us with some of the truest, purest
works of fiction in the language. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gaskell</b></font>) was herself what her (<font color='blue'><b>Gaskell</b></font>) works
show her (<font color='blue'><b>Gaskell</b></font>) to have been--a wise, good woman.

<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.org

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
