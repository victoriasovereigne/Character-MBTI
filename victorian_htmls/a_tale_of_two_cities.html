<p/>I. The Period


<p/>It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way--
in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

<p/>There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
that things in general were settled for ever.

<p/>It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) five-and-twentieth
blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
messages, as the spirits of this very year last past -LRB-supernaturally
deficient in originality-RRB- rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
brood.

<p/>France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>)
sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>)
Christian pastors, she (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) entertained herself, besides, with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) hands cut off, his (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) tongue
torn out with pincers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) body burned alive, because he (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty
yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and
Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,
already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with
rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which
the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) tumbrils of
the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.

<p/>In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman
in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
challenged by his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) fellow-tradesman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) character of
<div class="bookquote">``the Captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div>gallantly shot him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) through the head and rode away; the
mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
then got shot dead himself by the other four, <div class="bookquote">``in consequence of the
failure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ammunition:''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>after which the mail was robbed in peace;
that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
illustrious creature in sight of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) retinue; prisoners in London
gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law
fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search
for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences
much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of
sixpence.

<p/>All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small
creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
roads that lay before them.




<p/>II. The Mail


<p/>It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.
The Dover road lay, as to him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
Shooter's Hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,
as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,
and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the
horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the
coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in
combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals
are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to
their duty.

<p/>With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through
the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested
them and brought them to a stand, with a wary <div class="bookquote">``Wo-ho! so-ho-then!''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>the
near leader violently shook his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) head and everything upon it--like an
unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the
hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a
nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.

<p/>There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the
air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the
waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out
everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,
and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
into it, as if they had made it all.

<p/>Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from
anything he (<font color='blue'><b>passengers</b></font>) saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was
hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from
the eyes of the body, of his (<font color='blue'><b>passengers</b></font>) two companions. In those days, travellers
were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on
the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,
when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in
<div class="bookquote">``the Captain's''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard
of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) own particular perch behind the mail, beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) feet,
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>), where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
deposited on a substratum of cutlass.

<p/>The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they
all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but
the horses; as to which cattle he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) could with a clear conscience have
taken his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the
journey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wo-ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>said the coachman. <div class="bookquote">``So, then! One more pull and you're at the
top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to
it!--Joe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>the guard replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What o’clock do you make it, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes, good, past eleven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My blood!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the vexed coachman, <div class="bookquote">``and not atop of Shooter's
yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div><p/>The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,
made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed
suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its
passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach
stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three
had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
into the mist and darkness, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) would have put himself in a fair way of
getting shot instantly as a highwayman.

<p/>The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses
stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tst! Joe!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They both listened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>returned the guard, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) hold
of the door, and mounting nimbly to his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) place. <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen! In the king's
name, all of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With this hurried adjuration, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) blunderbuss, and stood on
the offensive.

<p/>The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;
the two other passengers were close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>), and about to follow. He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>)
remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained
in the road below him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>). They all looked from the coachman to the guard,
and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked
back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up
his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) ears and looked back, without contradicting.

<p/>The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet
indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the
passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the
quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding
the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.

<p/>The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So-ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>the guard sang out, as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) could roar. <div class="bookquote">``Yo there! Stand!
I shall fire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,
a man's voice called from the mist, <div class="bookquote">``Is that the Dover mail?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind what it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>the guard retorted. <div class="bookquote">``What are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Is_ that the Dover mail?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you want to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want a passenger, if it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What passenger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarvis Lorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>passenger</b></font>)</div><p/>Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) name. The guard,
the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) distrustfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep where you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>the guard called to the voice in the mist,
<div class="bookquote">``because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in
your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div>asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering
speech. <div class="bookquote">``Who wants me? Is it Jerry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>growled the guard to
himself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)'s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Lorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know this messenger, guard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the
road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and
pulled up the window. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) may come close; there's nothing wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope there ain't, but I can't make so `Nation sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>said the
guard, in gruff soliloquy. <div class="bookquote">``Hallo you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! And hallo you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you've got holsters to that
saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh `em. For I'm a devil
at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So
now let's look at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>rider</b></font>)</div><p/>The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,
and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider
stooped, and, casting up his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) eyes at the guard, handed the passenger
a small folded paper. The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and
rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guard!''  (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div>said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.

<p/>The watchful guard, with his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) right hand at the stock of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) raised
blunderbuss, his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) left at the barrel, and his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) eye on the horseman,
answered curtly, <div class="bookquote">``Sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the horseman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank. You must
know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown
to drink. I may read this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so be as you're quick, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and
read--first to himself and then aloud: ```Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.'
It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED
TO LIFE.''

<p/>Jerry started in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) saddle. <div class="bookquote">``That's a Blazing strange answer, too,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) hoarsest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as
well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div><p/>With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at
all assisted by his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted
their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general
pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape
the hazard of originating any other kind of action.

<p/>The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) blunderbuss
in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and
having looked to the supplementary pistols that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) wore in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) belt,
looked to a smaller chest beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) seat, in which there were a
few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was
furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown
and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had only to shut
himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,
and get a light with tolerable safety and ease -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) were lucky-RRB- in
five minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>coach</b></font>)</div>softly over the coach roof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear the message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you make of it, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing at all, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a coincidence, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>the guard mused, <div class="bookquote">``for I made the same of it
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not
only to ease his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) face, and
shake the wet out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) hat-brim, which might be capable of
holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
hearing and the night was quite still again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) turned to walk down the
hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your
fore-legs till I get you on the level,''  (<font color='red'><b>this messenger</b></font>)</div>said this hoarse messenger,
glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) mare. ```Recalled to life.' That's a Blazing strange
message. Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You'd
be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,
Jerry!''




<p/>III. The Night Shadows


<p/>A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A
solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every
one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every
room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of
its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the
awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I
turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time
to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable
water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses
of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the
book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read
but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an
eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood
in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,
my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable
consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In
any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there
a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?

<p/>As to this, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the
messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the
first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the
three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had
been in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) own coach and six, or his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) own coach and sixty, with the
breadth of a county between him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) and the next.

<p/>The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at
ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
own counsel, and to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hat cocked over his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had eyes that
assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with
no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they
were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too
far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like
a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees. When he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) stopped
for drink, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) moved this muffler with his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) left hand, only while he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
poured his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) liquor in with his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) right; as soon as that was done, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
muffled again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Jerry, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the messenger</b></font>)</div>said the messenger, harping on one theme as he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) rode.
<div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't
suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>)'d
been a drinking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) message perplexed his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) mind to that degree that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was fain, several
times, to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hat to scratch his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) head. Except on the crown,
which was raggedly bald, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all
over it, and growing down hill almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) broad, blunt nose. It was
so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might
have declined him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trotted back with the message he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to deliver to the night
watchman in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as arose out of the message, and took such
shapes to the mare as arose out of _her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)_ private topics of uneasiness.
They seemed to be numerous, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) shied at every shadow on the road.

<p/>What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon
its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,
likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms
their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.

<p/>Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank
passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what
lay in it to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) from pounding against the next passenger,
and driving him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) corner, whenever the coach got a special
jolt--nodded in his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) place, with half-shut eyes, the little
coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the
bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great
stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,
and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with
all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then
the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger -LRB-and it was not a
little that he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) knew about them-RRB-, opened before him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) went in among
them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them
safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) had last seen them.

<p/>But, though the bank was almost always with him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>), and though the coach
-LRB-in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate-RRB- was
always with him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run, all through the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) way to dig some one
out of a grave.

<p/>Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did
not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by
years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,
and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,
defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;
so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands
and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
spectre:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buried how long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div><p/>The answer was always the same: <div class="bookquote">``Almost eighteen years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that you are recalled to life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They tell me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you care to live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I show her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) to you? Will you come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes
the broken reply was, <div class="bookquote">``Wait! It would kill me if I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) too soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,
<div class="bookquote">``Take me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it
was, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>). I don't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div><p/>After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) fancy would dig,
and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>)
hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth
hanging about his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) face and hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) would suddenly fan away to dust. The
passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the
reality of mist and rain on his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) cheek.

<p/>Yet even when his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving
patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating
by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the
real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express
sent after him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), and the real message returned, would all be there. Out
of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) would accost
it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buried how long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost eighteen years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you care to live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the passengers</b></font>)</div><p/>Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) to pull up the window, draw his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) arm
securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms, until his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) mind lost its hold of them, and they again
slid away into the bank and the grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buried how long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost eighteen years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div><p/>The words were still in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hearing as just spoken--distinctly in
his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hearing as ever spoken words had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) life--when the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the
shadows of the night were gone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a
ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,
and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighteen years!''  (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div>said the passenger, looking at the sun. <div class="bookquote">``Gracious
Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>IV. The Preparation


<p/>When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,
the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hotel</b></font>)
custom was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hotel</b></font>) did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey
from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
traveller upon.

<p/>By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather
like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out
of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and
muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The
tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,
sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.
Show Concord! Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off
gentleman's boots in Concord. -LRB-You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.-RRB-
Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a passenger</b></font>)</div><p/>The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,
all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another
drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all
loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord
and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a
brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large
square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way to
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) breakfast.

<p/>The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman
in brown. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat,
with its light shining on him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), waiting for the meal, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat so still,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might have been sitting for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) portrait.

<p/>Very orderly and methodical he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked, with a hand on each knee, and a
loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) flapped waist-coat,
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a good leg, and was a little vain
of it, for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a
fine texture; his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which
looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.
His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stockings,
was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A
face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the
quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and
reserved expression of Tellson's Bank. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had a healthy colour in his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
cheeks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.
But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were
principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps
second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.

<p/>Completing his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) resemblance to a man who was sitting for his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) portrait,
Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breakfast roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said to the drawer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chair to it:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
time to-day. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may only ask for a
gentleman from Tellson's Bank. Please to let me know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. Tellson's Bank in London, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A
vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,
sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last
from France.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people's
time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and
Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen
years ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from
the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rounding his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mouth and both his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stepped backward from the
table, the waiter shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) napkin from his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) right arm to his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) left,
dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while
he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the
immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.

<p/>When Mr. Lorry had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) went out for a stroll on
the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine
ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was
destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and
brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong
a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little
fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by
night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide
made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,
sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable
that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.

<p/>As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became
again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud
too. When it was dark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) dinner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breakfast, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind was busily digging,
digging, digging, in the live red coals.

<p/>A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>digger</b></font>) out of work.
Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) last
glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) set down his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) glass untouched. <div class="bookquote">``This is Mam'selle!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/>In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette
had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from
Tellson's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none
then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson's
immediately, if it suited his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pleasure and convenience.

<p/>The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) odd little flaxen
wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment.
It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black
horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and
oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep
graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected
from them until they were dug out.

<p/>The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for
the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall
candles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) saw standing to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) by the table between them and
the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,
and still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand. As
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden
hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own with an inquiring look, and
a forehead with a singular capacity -LRB-remembering how young and smooth
it was-RRB-, of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright
fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>),
of a child whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms on the passage across that very
Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran
high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of
the gaunt pier-glass behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), on the frame of which, a hospital
procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were
offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the
feminine gender--and he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) formal bow to Miss Manette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray take a seat, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a
little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I kiss your hand, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier
date, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) formal bow again, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that
some intelligence--or discovery--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The word is not material, miss; either word will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so
long dead--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry moved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chair, and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for
anybody in their absurd baskets!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate
with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for
the purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I was prepared to hear, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) curtseyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) -LRB-young ladies made curtseys in those days-RRB-, with a
pretty desire to convey to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) felt how much older and wiser he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
was than she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) another bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by
those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to
France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with
me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,
during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection. The
gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to
beg the favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) waiting for me here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``to be entrusted with the charge. I shall
be more happy to execute it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me
by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a
strong and eager interest to know what they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After a pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
ears, <div class="bookquote">``It is very difficult to begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) did not begin, but, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) indecision, met her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) glance. The young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty
and characteristic, besides being singular--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) hand,
as if with an involuntary action she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) caught at, or stayed some passing
shadow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, and extended them outwards with
an argumentative smile.

<p/>Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of
which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression
deepened itself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) had hitherto remained standing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) mused, and the
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) eyes again, went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you
as a young English lady, Miss Manette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to
acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than
if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with
your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Story!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) seemed wilfully to mistake the word she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) had repeated, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) added,
in a hurry, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call
our connection our customers. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a French gentleman; a scientific
gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not of Beauvais?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) there.
Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that
time in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) married--an English lady--and
I was one of the trustees. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) affairs, like the affairs of many other
French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands.
In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;
there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like
sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my
business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in
the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere
machine. To go on--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to think'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--the
curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``that when I was
left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years,
it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put it with some ceremony to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) then
conducted the young lady straightway to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair again, and, holding
the chair-back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) left hand, and using his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) right by turns to rub
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chin, pull his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wig at the ears, or point what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said, stood looking
down into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself
just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold
with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect
that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of
Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business of
Tellson's House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance
of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary
Mangle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>After this odd description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry
flattened his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) flaxen wig upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head with both hands -LRB-which was most
unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
before-RRB-, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) former attitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So far, miss -LRB-as you have remarked-RRB-, this is the story of your
regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died
when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did--Don't be frightened! How you start!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did, indeed, start. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wrist with both her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) left hand from
the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in so violent a tremble: <div class="bookquote">``pray control your agitation--a matter of
business. As I was saying--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) look so discomposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stopped, wandered, and began anew:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had suddenly
and silently disappeared; if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been spirited away; if it had not
been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could
trace him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the
privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one
to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife had
implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have
been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I entreat you to tell me more, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will. I am going to. You can bear it?''

if this doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The little child was a daughter, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A daughter. A-a-matter of business--don't be distressed. Miss, if the

that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
inheritance of any part of the agony she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had known the pains of, by
rearing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the belief that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father was dead--No, don't kneel! In

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact
business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly
mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Without directly answering to this appeal, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat so still when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had
very gently raised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right, that's right. Courage! Business! You have business before
you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with
you. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) unavailing search for your father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) left you, at two years old,
to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud
upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked down, with an admiring pity, on the
flowing golden hair; as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) pictured to himself that it might have
been already tinged with grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new
discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wrist held closer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stopped. The expression in the
forehead, which had so particularly attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) notice, and which was
now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been--been found. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is alive. Greatly changed, it is too
probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.
Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if I can: you, to
restore him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A shiver ran through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) frame, and from it through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, in a
low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were saying it in a dream,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to see his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Ghost! It will be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Ghost--not him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``There, there,
there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.
You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I have been free, I

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one thing more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attention: <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been found under
another name; his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be
worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to
know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,
because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject,
anywhere or in any way, and to remove him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)--for a while at all
events--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even
Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of
the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring
to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries,
and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, `Recalled to Life;'
which may mean anything. But what is the matter! She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) doesn't notice a
word! Miss Manette!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
sat under his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, utterly insensible; with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes open and fixed
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
branded into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead. So close was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hold upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
feared to detach himself lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) should hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) called
out loudly for assistance without moving.

<p/>A wild-looking woman, whom even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to
be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some
extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head a most
wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,
or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the
inn servants, and soon settled the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) detachment from the
poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chest, and sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
flying back against the nearest wall.

<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I really think this must be a man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Lorry's breathless
reflection, simultaneously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) coming against the wall.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, look at you all!''  (<font color='red'><b>the inn servants</b></font>)</div>bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring
at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don't you go and fetch
things? I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts, cold
water, and vinegar, quick, I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with great skill and
gentleness: calling her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``my precious!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``my bird!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and spreading her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
golden hair aside over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoulders with great pride and care.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you in brown!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;
<div class="bookquote">``couldn't you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) what you had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), without frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
to death? Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pretty pale face and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cold hands. Do
you call _that_ being a Banker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler
sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn
servants under the mysterious penalty of <div class="bookquote">``letting them know''  (<font color='red'><b>the inn servants</b></font>)</div>something
not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) charge by a
regular series of gradations, and coaxed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drooping head
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will do well now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No thanks to you in brown, if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does. My darling pretty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility, <div class="bookquote">``that you accompany Miss Manette to France?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A likely thing, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the strong woman. <div class="bookquote">``If it was ever
intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
would have cast my lot in an island?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to
consider it.




<p/>V. The Wine-shop


<p/>A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just
outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.

<p/>All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular
stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have
thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,
had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own
jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,
made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help
women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all
run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in
the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with
handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants'
mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;
others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and
there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed
pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted
fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the
wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up
along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,
if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
presence.

<p/>A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,
and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There
was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a
special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part
of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the
luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,
shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen
together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been
most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these
demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who
had left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw sticking in the firewood he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was cutting, set it in
motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of
hot ashes, at which she (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) had been trying to soften the pain in her (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) own
starved fingers and toes, or in those of her (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) child, returned to it; men
with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into
the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom
gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.

<p/>The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street
in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had
stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many
wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks
on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) baby, was
stained with the stain of the old rag she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wound about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head again.
Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a
tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>)
head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled
upon a wall with his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.

<p/>The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the
street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.

<p/>And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary
gleam had driven from his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) sacred countenance, the darkness of it was
heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;
but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a
terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the
fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,
passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered
in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which
had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the
children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the
grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,
was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out
of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless
chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,
among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the
baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) scanty stock of
bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that
was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every
farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant
drops of oil.

<p/>Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding
street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and
slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor
compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted
into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or
inflicting. The trade signs -LRB-and they were almost as many as the shops-RRB-
were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman
painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of
meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,
croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were
gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives
and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the
gunmaker's stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,
with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but
broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down
the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy
rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across
the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,
and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and
the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.

<p/>For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so
long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) method, and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their
condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over
France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of
song and feather, took no warning.

<p/>The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its
appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside
it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine. <div class="bookquote">``It's not my affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), with a final shrug
of the shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``The people from the market did it. Let them bring
another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the joker</b></font>)</div><p/>There, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) joke,
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) across the way:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The fellow pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) joke with immense significance, as is often
the way with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is
often the way with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tribe too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>said the wine-shop
keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of
mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you write
in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place
to write such words in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) expostulation he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cleaner hand -LRB-perhaps accidentally,
perhaps not-RRB- upon the joker's heart. The joker rapped it with his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>)
own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing
attitude, with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) stained shoes jerked off his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) foot into his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>)
hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
practical character, he (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) looked, under those circumstances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it on, put it on,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. <div class="bookquote">``Call wine, wine; and finish
there.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With that advice, he (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) soiled hand upon the joker's
dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on
his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.

<p/>This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a
bitter day, he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) wore no coat, but carried one slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) shoulder.
His (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) brown arms were bare to
the elbows. Neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) wear anything more on his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) head than his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) own
crisply-curling short dark hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) was a dark man altogether, with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on
the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn
the man.

<p/>Madame Defarge, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own age, with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand
heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of
manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might
have predicated that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not often make mistakes against herself
in any of the reckonings over which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presided. Madame Defarge being
sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright
shawl twined about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, though not to the concealment of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) large
earrings. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knitting was before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had laid it down to pick
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right elbow supported
by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lord came in, but
coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) darkly defined eyebrows over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) toothpick by the breadth of a
line, suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would do well to look round the
shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stepped over the way.

<p/>The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) eyes about, until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine. As he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) passed behind the counter, he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, <div class="bookquote">``This is our man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Defarge
to himself; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How goes it, Jacques?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Is
all the spilt wine swallowed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every drop, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>answered Monsieur Defarge.

<p/>When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,
picking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) teeth with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,
and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyebrows by the breadth of another line.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur
Defarge, <div class="bookquote">``that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or
of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Monsieur Defarge returned.

<p/>At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still
using her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of
cough, and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyebrows by the breadth of another line.

<p/>The last of the three now said his (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) say, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) empty
drinking vessel and smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I
right, Jacques?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>was the response of Monsieur Defarge.

<p/>This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment
when Madame Defarge put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) toothpick by, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyebrows up, and
slightly rustled in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold then! True!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>muttered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen--my wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The customers</b></font>)</div><p/>The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three
flourishes. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) acknowledged their homage by bending her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, and
giving them a quick look. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glanced in a casual manner round the
wine-shop, took up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit, and became absorbed in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband day</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, who had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bright eye observantly
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you
wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the
fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``near to the window of
my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been
there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur
Defarge were studying his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) corner, and begged the favour of a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Willingly, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to
the door.

<p/>Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first
word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had
not lasted a minute, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nodded and went out. The gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.

<p/>Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,
joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own
company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) old master, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lips. It was
a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable
transformation had come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in a few seconds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had no good-humour
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,
angry, dangerous man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began
ascending the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the latter whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alone! God help him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), who should be with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, in the
same low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) always alone, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own desire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own necessity. As he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was, when I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) after they
found me and demanded to know if I would take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and, at my peril be
discreet--as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was then, so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is greatly changed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Changed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The keeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) hand,
and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so
forcible. Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
two companions ascended higher and higher.

<p/>Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile
indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides
flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and
hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted
the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost
insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt
and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own disturbance of mind, and to
his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.
Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made
at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left
uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer
or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any
promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.

<p/>At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the
third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story
was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in
advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about
here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) carried over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoulder, took out a key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The door is locked then, my friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay. Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it necessary to turn the key.''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Monsieur Defarge whispered it
closer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) ear, and frowned heavily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why! Because he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has lived so long, locked up, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be
frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what
harm--if his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) door was left open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>repeated Defarge, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. And a beautiful
world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things
are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under
that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word
of it had reached the young lady's ears. But, by this time she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) trembled
under such strong emotion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face expressed such deep anxiety,
and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to speak a word or two of reassurance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a
moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,
all the good you bring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>), all the relief, all the happiness you
bring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>), begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.
That's well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were
soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at
once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at
the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which
the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing
footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed
themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
wine-shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>explained Monsieur
Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Leave us, good boys; we have business here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The three glided by, and went silently down.

<p/>There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of
the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.
Lorry asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in a whisper, with a little anger:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I show him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ think it is well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are the few? How do you choose them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the
sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another
thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stooped, and looked in
through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) struck
twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to
make a noise there. With the same intention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) drew the key across it,
three or four times, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put it clumsily into the lock, and turned
it as heavily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could.

<p/>The door slowly opened inward under his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked into the
room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more
than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry
got his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was sinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A-a-a-business, business!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) urged, with a moisture that was not of
business shining on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">``Come in, come in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) answered, shuddering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of it? What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>). Of my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>conductor</b></font>)</div><p/>Rendered in a manner desperate, by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) state and by the beckoning of
their conductor, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) drew over his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) neck the arm that shook upon his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>)
shoulder, lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a little, and hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) into the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) sat her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
down just within the door, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>).

<p/>Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,
took out the key again, and held it in his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) hand. All this he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) did,
methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>)
could make. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) walked across the room with a measured tread to
where the window was. He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) stopped there, and faced round.

<p/>The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim
and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the
roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any
other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this
door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.
Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it
was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being
done in the garret; for, with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) back towards the door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very
busy, making shoes.




<p/>VI. The Shoemaker


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Shoemaker</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that
bent low over the shoemaking.

<p/>It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation, as if it were at a distance:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are still hard at work, I see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the
voice replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I am working.''  (<font color='red'><b>the questioner</b></font>)</div>This time, a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.

<p/>The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the
faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and
suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive
it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered
home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.

<p/>Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked
up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical
perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were
aware of had stood, was not yet empty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, who had not removed his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) gaze from the shoemaker,
<div class="bookquote">``to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shoemaker</b></font>)</div><p/>The shoemaker stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) work; looked with a vacant air of listening,
at the floor on one side of him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>); then similarly, at the floor on the
other side of him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>); then, upward at the speaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can bear a little more light?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must bear it, if you let it in.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Laying the palest shadow of a
stress upon the second word.-RRB-

<p/>The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that
angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) lap, pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
labour. His (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
feet and on his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) bench. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very
long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and
thinness of his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) face would have caused them to look large, under his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) yet
dark eyebrows and his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) confused white hair, though they had been really
otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.
His (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) body
to be withered and worn. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) old canvas frock, and his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) loose
stockings, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion
from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of
parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) had put up a hand between his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) eyes and the light, and the very bones
of it seemed transparent. So he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,
pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) work. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) never looked at the figure before him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), without
first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) had
lost the habit of associating place with sound; he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) never spoke, without
first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>asked Defarge,
motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But, the question reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bent over it again.

<p/>Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker
looked up. He (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
unsteady fingers of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) hands strayed to his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) looked at
it -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) lips and his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) nails were of the same pale lead-colour-RRB-, and then
the hand dropped to his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) once more bent over the shoe. The
look and the action had occupied but an instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a visitor, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is a visitor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The shoemaker</b></font>)</div><p/>The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>)
work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when
he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sees one. Show him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry took it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shoemaker</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shoemaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's
information?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a lady's shoe. It is a young lady's walking-shoe. It is in the
present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>)
glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the maker's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge.

<p/>Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) had no work to hold, he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) laid the knuckles of the right hand
in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) bearded chin, and
so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission. The task of
recalling him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) from the vagrancy into which he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) always sank when he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>)
had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or
endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a
fast-dying man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ask me for my name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Assuredly I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One Hundred and Five, North Tower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One Hundred and Five, North Tower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent to work
again, until the silence was again broken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not a shoemaker by trade?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would have transferred the
question to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>): but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back
on the questioner when they had sought the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I
learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>)
hands the whole time. His (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face
from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) started, and
resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a
subject of last night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after
a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) hand for the shoe that had been taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>), Mr.
Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>The shoe dropped to the ground, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat looking fixedly at the
questioner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Manette'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>; Mr. Lorry laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand upon Defarge's arm; <div class="bookquote">``do you
remember nothing of this man? Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Look at me. Is there no old
banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your
mind, Monsieur Manette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.
Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>). They were overclouded
again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) who
had crept along the wall to a point where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) now stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), with hands which at first had been only
raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) off and
shut out the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), but which were now extending towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>),
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) warm young
breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression
repeated -LRB-though in stronger characters-RRB- on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) fair young face, that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/>Darkness had fallen on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in its place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked at the two, less and
less attentively, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
took the shoe up, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), monsieur?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>asked Defarge in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have
unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so
well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat. There was something awful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stooped
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) labour.

<p/>Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stood, like a spirit,
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) work.

<p/>It happened, at length, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had occasion to change the instrument
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoemaker's knife. It lay on that side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
which was not the side on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had taken it up, and was
stooping to work again, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes caught the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
raised them, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face. The two spectators started forward,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stayed them with a motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had no fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
striking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) with the knife, though they had.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) with a fearful look, and after a while his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lips began
to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in
the pauses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) quick and laboured breathing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was heard to say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With the tears streaming down her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) two hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
lips, and kissed them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>); then clasped them on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breast, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) ruined head there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not the gaoler's daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sighed <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Not yet trusting the tones of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat down on the bench
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) recoiled, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm. A strange
thrill struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) did so, and visibly passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) frame; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
laid the knife down softly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) golden hair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed
aside, and fell down over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) neck. Advancing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand by little and
little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
shoemaking.

<p/>But not for long. Releasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to
be sure that it was really there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) work, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
attached to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) opened this, carefully, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knee, and it contained
a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden
hairs, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had, in some old day, wound off upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) finger.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hair into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand again, and looked closely at it. <div class="bookquote">``It is
the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As the concentrated expression returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) forehead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) seemed to
become conscious that it was in hers too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) full to the
light, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had laid her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned
out--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was
brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. `You will
leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they
may in the spirit.' Those were the words I said. I remember them very
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) formed this speech with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lips many times before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could utter it.
But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) did find spoken words for it, they came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) coherently,
though slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How was this?--_Was it you_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spectators</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more, the two spectators started, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with a
frightful suddenness. But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sat perfectly still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) grasp, and only
said, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near
us, do not speak, do not move!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Whose voice was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands released her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) uttered this cry, and went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) white
hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
shoemaking did die out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) refolded his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) little packet and
tried to secure it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breast; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) still looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and
gloomily shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can't be. See what the
prisoner is. These are not the hands she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew, this is not the face
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew, this is not a voice she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ever heard. No, no. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was--and He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your
name, my gentle angel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Hailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) softened tone and manner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daughter fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) knees
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) appealing hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,
and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I
cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may
tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless
me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) cold white head mingled with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) radiant hair, which warmed and
lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you hear in my voice--I don't know that it is so, but I hope it
is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in
touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when
I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you
with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the
remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,
weep for it, weep for it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) closer round the neck, and rocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) breast like a
child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,
and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And
if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,
and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my
honoured father, and implore his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pardon for having never for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake
striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of
my poor mother hid his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep

tears upon my face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank
God for us, thank God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had sunk in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arms, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) breast: a sight so
touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.

<p/>When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heaving
breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm
called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and
daughter from the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay
there in a lethargy, worn out. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had nestled down with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
head might lie upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arm; and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hair drooping over him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) curtained
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from the light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If, without disturbing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand to Mr. Lorry as

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. <div class="bookquote">``More
than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.
Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
methodical manners; <div class="bookquote">``and if business is to be done, I had better do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then be so kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div>urged Miss Manette, <div class="bookquote">``as to leave us here. You see how
composed he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with me
now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from
interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), when you come back,
as quiet as you leave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). In any case, I will take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) until
you return, and then we will remove him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div><p/>Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and
in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage
and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,
for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
to do it.

<p/>Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) head down on the
hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The darkness
deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed
through the chinks in the wall.

<p/>Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and
had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and
meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the
lamp he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) carried, on the shoemaker's bench -LRB-there was nothing else in the
garret but a pallet bed-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and
assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) feet.

<p/>No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind, in
the scared blank wonder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew what had happened,
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) recollected what they had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They
tried speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>); but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was so confused, and so very slow to
answer, that they took fright at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bewilderment, and agreed for
the time to tamper with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had a wild, lost manner of
occasionally clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, that had not been seen
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) before; yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had some pleasure in the mere sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
ate and drank what they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to eat and drink, and put on the cloak
and other wrappings, that they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to wear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) readily responded to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daughter's drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and took--and kept--her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand
in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own.

<p/>They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.
Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps
of the long main staircase when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stopped, and stared at the roof and
round at the walls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But, before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could repeat the question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) murmured an answer as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had repeated it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember? No, I don't remember. It was so very long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had no recollection whatever of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) having been brought from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mutter,
<div class="bookquote">``One Hundred and Five, North Tower;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), it
evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>). On their reaching the courtyard he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) instinctively altered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was
no drawbridge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daughter's hand and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head again.

<p/>No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the
many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural
silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and
that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and
saw nothing.

<p/>The prisoner had got into a coach, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) daughter had followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) asking,
miserably, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame
Defarge immediately called to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would get them, and
went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) quickly
brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned
against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.

<p/>Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word <div class="bookquote">``To the Barrier!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>The
postilion cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) whip, and they clattered away under the feeble
over-swinging lamps.

<p/>Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better
streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,
illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. <div class="bookquote">``Your papers,
travellers!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See here then, Monsieur the Officer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge,
getting down, and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gravely apart, <div class="bookquote">``these are the papers of
monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>), at the--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) voice, there was a flutter among the
military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day
or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. <div class="bookquote">``It is well.
Forward!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from the uniform. <div class="bookquote">``Adieu!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>from Defarge. And so, under a short
grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great
grove of stars.

<p/>Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from
this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
lost to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you care to be recalled to life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And the old answer:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The end of the first book.





<p/>Book the Second--the Golden Thread




<p/>I. Five Years Later


<p/>Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very
dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,
moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence
in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if
it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was
no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business. Tellson's -LRB-they said-RRB- wanted
no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no
embellishment. Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but
Tellson's, thank Heaven--!

<p/>Any one of these partners would have disinherited his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) son on the
question of rebuilding Tellson's. In this respect the House was much
on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
objectionable, but were only the more respectable.

<p/>Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection
of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps,
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little
counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,
and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing
<div class="bookquote">``the House,''  (<font color='red'><b>House</b></font>)</div>you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,
where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its
hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden
drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they
were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among
the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good
polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms
made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their
parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family
papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great
dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you
by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released
from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads
exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
Abyssinia or Ashantee.

<p/>But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's.
Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's?
Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note
was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the
purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder
of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to
Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of
three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to
Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it
might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
reverse--but, it cleared off -LRB-as to this world-RRB- the trouble of each
particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
after. Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business,
its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid
low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately
disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the
ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.

<p/>Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the
oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young
man into Tellson's London house, they hid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somewhere till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
old. They kept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a dark place, like a cheese, until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the full
Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Then only was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) permitted to
be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breeches
and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.

<p/>Outside Tellson's--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an
odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live
sign of the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was never absent during business hours, unless
upon an errand, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was represented by his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) son: a grisly urchin
of twelve, who was his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) express image. People understood that Tellson's,
in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always
tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted
this person to the post. His (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful
occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the
easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had received the added
appellation of Jerry.

<p/>The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,
Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March
morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. -LRB-Mr. Cruncher himself
always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under
the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a
popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name upon it.-RRB-

<p/>Mr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were
but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as
it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) lay abed was
already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged
for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth
was spread.

<p/>Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin
at home. At first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll
and surge in bed, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) rose above the surface, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) spiky hair
looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bust me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) ain't at it agin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees in a
corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the
person referred to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. <div class="bookquote">``You're at it
agin, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) threw a boot at
the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the
odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy, that,
whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, varying his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) apostrophe after missing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
mark--<div class="bookquote">``what are you up to, Aggerawayter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only saying my prayers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saying your prayers! You're a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping
yourself down and praying agin me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You weren't. And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with. Here!
your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your
father's prosperity. You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.
You've got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping
herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out
of the mouth of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Cruncher -LRB-who was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) shirt-RRB- took this very ill, and, turning
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) personal
board.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you suppose, you conceited female,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, with
unconscious inconsistency, <div class="bookquote">``that the worth of _your_ prayers may be?
Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worth no more than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Cruncher. <div class="bookquote">``They ain't worth
much, then. Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you. I can't
afford it. I'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If
you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and
child, and not in opposition to `em. If I had had any but a unnat'ral
wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might
have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.
B-u-u-ust me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) clothes, <div class="bookquote">``if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed thing and
another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my
boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I
tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>here he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) wife once more, <div class="bookquote">``I won't be gone agin,
in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as
laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if
it wasn't for the pain in `em, which was me and which somebody else, yet
I'm none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've
been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you
say now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Growling, in addition, such phrases as <div class="bookquote">``Ah! yes! You're religious, too.
You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
and child, would you? Not you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
from the whirling grindstone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook
himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) boot-cleaning and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) general preparation for business.
In the meantime, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,
and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) father's did,
kept the required watch upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) greatly disturbed that poor
woman at intervals, by darting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) sleeping closet, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) toilet, with a suppressed cry of <div class="bookquote">``You are going to flop, mother.
--Halloa, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in
again with an undutiful grin.

<p/>Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
breakfast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular
animosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) wife explained that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had merely <div class="bookquote">``asked a blessing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crunches</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crunches</b></font>) rather expected
to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crunches</b></font>) wife's petitions. <div class="bookquote">``I
ain't a going to be blest out of house and home. I won't have my wittles
blest off my table. Keep still!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crunches</b></font>) had been up all night at a party
which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed
inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o’clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) smoothed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) ruffled
aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) could overlay his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) natural self with, issued forth to the occupation
of the day.

<p/>It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) favourite
description of himself as <div class="bookquote">``a honest tradesman.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) stock consisted of
a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool,
young Jerry, walking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father's side, carried every morning to
beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,
with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's
feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), Mr.
Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar
itself,--and was almost as in-looking.

<p/>Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's,
Jerry took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry
standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to
inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
boys who were small enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) amiable purpose. Father and son,
extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic
in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two
eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that
the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the
youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) as of everything else
in Fleet-street.

<p/>The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's
establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Porter wanted!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tellson/Bank/Tellson 's Bank</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hooray, father! Here's an early job to begin with!''

 (<font color='red'><b>parent</b></font>)</div><p/>Having thus given his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on
the stool, entered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) reversionary interest in the straw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father
had been chewing, and cogitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Al-ways rusty! His (<font color='blue'><b>Porter</b></font>) fingers is al-ways rusty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>muttered young Jerry.
<div class="bookquote">``Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) don't get no iron
rust here!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>II. A Sight


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?''  (<font color='red'><b>clerks</b></font>)</div>said one of the oldest of
clerks to Jerry the messenger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. <div class="bookquote">``I _do_
know the Bailey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much
better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
in question, <div class="bookquote">``than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a witness</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the
door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) will then let you in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Into the court, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Into the court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to
interchange the inquiry, <div class="bookquote">``What do you think of this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to wait in the court, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) asked, as the result of that
conference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.
Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry's
attention, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,
to remain there until he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wants you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
you are there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,
Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) in silence until he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) came to the
blotting-paper stage, remarked:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Treason!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's quartering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>said Jerry. <div class="bookquote">``Barbarous!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the law,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>remarked the ancient clerk, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) surprised
spectacles upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is the law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It's hard enough to kill
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but it's wery hard to spile him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>retained the ancient clerk. <div class="bookquote">``Speak well of the law. Take
care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take
care of itself. I give you that advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>said Jerry. <div class="bookquote">``I
leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the old clerk; <div class="bookquote">``we all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry
ways. Here is the letter. Go along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) made an outward show of, <div class="bookquote">``You are a lean old one,
too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) bow, informed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) son, in passing, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) destination,
and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) way.

<p/>They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had
not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came
into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) off the bench. It
had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced
his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>).
For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,
from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on
a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a
half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.
So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It
was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted
a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for
the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and
softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in
blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice
illustration of the precept, that <div class="bookquote">``Whatever is is right;''  (<font color='red'><b>the Old Bailey</b></font>)</div>an aphorism
that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome
consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.

<p/>Making his (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this
hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
way quietly, the messenger found out the door he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sought, and handed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play
at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the
former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey
doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the
criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.

<p/>After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into
court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's on?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) asked, in a whisper, of the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) found himself next
to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's coming on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Treason case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The quartering one, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returned the man, with a relish; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'ll be drawn on a hurdle to
be half hanged, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'ll be taken down and sliced before his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) own
face, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) inside will be taken out and burnt while he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) looks on,
and then his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) head will be chopped off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'ll be cut into quarters.
That's the sentence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'s found Guilty, you mean to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>Jerry added, by way of proviso.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! they'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) guilty,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you be afraid of
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
saw making his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) hand. Mr. Lorry
sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged
gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers
before him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>): and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands
in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) chin and signing
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up
to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and who quietly nodded and sat down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's _he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)_ got to do with the case?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spoken with.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blest if I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>said Jerry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blest if I know that either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>said Jerry.

<p/>The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the
central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,
went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.

<p/>Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
ceiling, stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). All the human breath in the place, rolled
at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round
pillars and corners, to get a sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); spectators in back rows
stood up, not to miss a hair of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); people on the floor of the court,
laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help
themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)--stood a-tiptoe, got
upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall
of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
whet he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had taken as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) came along, and discharging it to mingle with
the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,
that flowed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), and already broke upon the great windows behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
in an impure mist and rain.

<p/>The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition was that of a young gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was plainly
dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, which was long and
dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck; more to be out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
situation engendered came through the brown upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheek, showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was otherwise quite self-possessed,
bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.

<p/>The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,
was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood in peril of a less
horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being spared--by just so much would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have lost in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various
spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and
powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.

<p/>Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to
an indictment denouncing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) -LRB-with infinite jingle and jangle-RRB- for that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) having, on divers
occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French
King, in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and
so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of
our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the
said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our
said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation
to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with
huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood
there before him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) trial; that the jury were swearing in; and
that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.

<p/>The accused, who was -LRB-and who knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) was-RRB- being mentally hanged,
beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from
the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) was quiet and
attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) hands resting on the slab of wood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>), so
composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.

<p/>Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together. Haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the
glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one
day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind. Be
that as it may, a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) position making him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) conscious of a bar
of light across his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) looked up; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) saw the glass his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
face flushed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) right hand pushed the herbs away.

<p/>It happened, that the action turned his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face to that side of the court
which was on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) left. About on a level with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes, there sat,
in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) look
immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>)
aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), turned to them.

<p/>The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than
twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father; a man of a very
remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair,
and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as
it was now, in a moment, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became a
handsome man, not past the prime of life.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter had one of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hands drawn through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sat by
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and the other pressed upon it. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had drawn close to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
dread of the scene, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pity for the prisoner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) forehead had
been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very
noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who
had had no pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) were touched by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and the whisper went about,
<div class="bookquote">``Who are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerry, the messenger, who had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) own observations, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) own
manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
absorption, stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) neck to hear who they were. The crowd about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and
from him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got
to Jerry:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Witnesses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For which side?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Against.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Against what side?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The prisoner's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Judge</b></font>)</div><p/>The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them,
leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the
axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.




<p/>III. A Disappointment


<p/>Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before
them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) life. That this correspondence with the
public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or
even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the
prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and
repassing between France and England, on secret business of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of
traitorous ways to thrive -LRB-which happily it never was-RRB-, the real
wickedness and guilt of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) business might have remained undiscovered.
That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who
was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the
prisoner's schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
Majesty's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.
That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) position and
attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been the prisoner's
friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could no longer cherish
in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) bosom, on the sacred altar of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) country. That, if statues
were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public
benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as
they were not so decreed, he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) probably would not have one. That, Virtue,
as had been observed by the poets -LRB-in many passages which he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) well
knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;
whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
they knew nothing about the passages-RRB-, was in a manner contagious; more
especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.
That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had
communicated itself to the prisoner's servant, and had engendered in him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
a holy determination to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) master's table-drawers and pockets,
and secrete his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) papers. That, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Attorney-General-RRB- was prepared to
hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,
in a general way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) preferred him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Attorney-General's-RRB-
brothers and sisters, and honoured him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) -LRB-Mr.
Attorney-General's-RRB- father and mother. That, he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) called with confidence
on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two
witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) Majesty's forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by
sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had habitually conveyed
such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be
proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting; but that it was all the
same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as
showing the prisoner to be artful in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) precautions. That, the proof
would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged
in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the
very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.
That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew they
were-RRB-, and being a responsible jury -LRB-as _they_ knew they were-RRB-, must
positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), whether
they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their
pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion
of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that
there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon
pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off. That head
Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of
everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) solemn asseveration that he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) already considered the prisoner as
good as dead and gone.

<p/>When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in
anticipation of what he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was soon to become. When toned down again, the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.

<p/>Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his (<font color='blue'><b>Solicitor-General</b></font>) leader's lead, examined the
patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) pure soul was
exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if
it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) noble bosom
of its burden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), sitting not far from Mr.
Lorry, begged to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting
opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.

<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ever been a spy himself? No, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) scorned the base insinuation.
What did he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) live upon? His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) property. Where was his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) property? He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) didn't
precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody's.
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inherited it? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had. From whom? Distant relation. Very
distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors'
prison? Didn't see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors'
prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three
times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever
been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs?
Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell
downstairs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentleman</b></font>) own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at
dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?
Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not
more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.
Ever pay him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a
very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?
No. Sure he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more
about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No.
Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government
pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear
no. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer
patriotism? None whatever.

<p/>The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) way through the case at a
great rate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
simplicity, four years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
packet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity--never thought of such a thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) began to have suspicions of
the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), soon afterwards. In arranging
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) clothes, while travelling, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoner's pockets, over and over again. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoner's desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had not put them there first. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen
at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and
Boulogne. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) country, and couldn't bear it, and had given
information. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
only a plated one. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had known the last witness seven or eight years;
that was merely a coincidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) didn't call it a particularly curious
coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)_ only motive too. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).

<p/>The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis
Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson's bank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wrapped up as

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was not one of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been--like
myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly have seen that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), to your

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the

voyage with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At what hour did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) come on board?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At a little after midnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the dead of the night. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) the only passenger who came on board

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind about `happening,' Mr. Lorry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was the only passenger who

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and
I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now
turned again, stood up where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had sat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father rose with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand drawn through his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>youth beauty</b></font>)</div><p/>To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was
far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.
Standing, as it were, apart with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grave, not all
the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
to remain quite still. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) efforts
to control and steady his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same
occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the young lady just now referred to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O! most unhappily, I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Judge</b></font>)</div><p/>The plaintive tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) compassion merged into the less musical voice
of the Judge, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) said something fiercely: <div class="bookquote">``Answer the questions put
to you, and make no remark upon them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
passage across the Channel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Recall it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><p/>In the midst of a profound stillness, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) faintly began: <div class="bookquote">``When the
gentleman came on board--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean the prisoner?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>inquired the Judge, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) brows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my Lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then say the prisoner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When the prisoner came on board, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) noticed that my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>turning
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes lovingly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was
afraid to take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out of the air, and I had made a bed for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on the
deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side to take
care of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). There were no other passengers that night, but we four.
The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could
shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I
had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would
set when we were out of the harbour. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did it for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expressed
great gentleness and kindness for my father's state, and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
felt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) come on board alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many were with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two French gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had they conferred together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was
necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don't know what
papers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like these in shape and size?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly, but indeed I don't know, although they stood whispering very
near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they
spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that
they looked at papers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, to the prisoner's conversation, Miss Manette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The prisoner was as open in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) confidence with me--which arose out
of my helpless situation--as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was kind, and good, and useful to my
father. I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>bursting into tears, <div class="bookquote">``I may not repay him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by doing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
harm to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Buzzing from the blue-flies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must
give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness,
he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was
therefore travelling under an assumed name. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said that this business
had, within a few days, taken him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to France, and might, at intervals,
take him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) backwards and forwards between France and England for a long
time to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said
that, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on
England's part. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George
Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the
Third. But there was no harm in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way of saying this: it was said
laughingly, and to beguile the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a actor</b></font>)</div><p/>Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
when the Judge looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about George Washington.

<p/>Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) deemed it
necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's
father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once. When he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or
three years and a half ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you identify him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or
speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) conversation with your daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I can do neither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
either?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) answered, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``There is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without
trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) answered, in a tone that went to every heart, <div class="bookquote">``A long imprisonment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you newly released on the occasion in question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They tell me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you no remembrance of the occasion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what
time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the
time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter
here. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored
my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had become
familiar. I have no remembrance of the process.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Attorney-General</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down
together.

<p/>A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being
to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked,
in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and
got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) did
not remain, but from which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) travelled back some dozen miles or more,
to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness
was called to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) as having been at the precise time required,
in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,
waiting for another person. The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining
this witness with no result, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had never seen the prisoner
on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a
little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Opening
this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The witness</b></font>)</div><p/>The witness was quite sure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the witness</b></font>)</div><p/>Not so like -LRB-the witness said-RRB- as that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) could be mistaken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>pointing
to him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) who had tossed the paper over, <div class="bookquote">``and then look well upon the
prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought
into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became
much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver -LRB-the prisoner's
counsel-RRB-, whether they were next to try Mr. Carton -LRB-name of my learned
friend-RRB- for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)
would ask the witness to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) whether what happened once, might
happen twice; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) would have been so confident if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had seen
this illustration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) rashness sooner, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) would be so
confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) part of the case to
useless lumber.

<p/>Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) following of the evidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) had now to attend while Mr.
Stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit
of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and
traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) certainly did look
rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) friend and partner,
and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family
affairs in France, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) being of French extraction, did require his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) making
those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a
consideration for others who were near and dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>),
even for his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped
and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they
had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that
reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;
how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the
State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed
-LRB-with as grave a face as if it had not been true-RRB-, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could
not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.

<p/>Mr. Stryver then called his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to
attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.
Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and
Cly were even a hundred times better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had thought them, and the
prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning
the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.

<p/>And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.

<p/>Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
changed neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) place nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) attitude, even in this excitement.
While his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) papers before him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>),
whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and
grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) seat,
and slowly paced up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) platform, not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) state was feverish; this one man
sat leaning back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) torn gown half off him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) head after its removal, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) pockets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
day. Something especially reckless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) demeanour, not only gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner -LRB-which his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) momentary earnestness,
when they were compared together, had strengthened-RRB-, that many of the
lookers-on, taking note of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) now, said to one another they would
hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the
observation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) next neighbour, and added, <div class="bookquote">``I'd hold half a guinea
that _he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)_ don't get no law-work to do. Don't look like the sort of one
to get any, do he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>neighbour</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>)
appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette's head dropped upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father's breast, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was the first to see it, and to say audibly:
<div class="bookquote">``Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) out.
Don't you see she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will fall!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was much commiseration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was removed, and much
sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father. It had evidently been a great distress to
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), to have the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) imprisonment recalled. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had shown
strong internal agitation when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was questioned, and that pondering or
brooding look which made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old, had been upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), like a heavy cloud,
ever since. As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a
moment, spoke, through their foreman.

<p/>They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord -LRB-perhaps with George
Washington on his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) mind-RRB- showed some surprise that they were not agreed,
but signified his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,
and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in
the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the
jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get
refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat
down.

<p/>Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father went out,
now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest,
could easily get near him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the
way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don't be a moment
behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You
are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long
before I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) knuckled it in
acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up
at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is the young lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is greatly distressed; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father is comforting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
feels the better for being out of court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell the prisoner so. It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman
like you, to be seen speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) publicly, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry reddened as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) were conscious of having debated the point
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind, and Mr. Carton made his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) way to the outside of the bar.
The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), all
eyes, ears, and spikes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Darnay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The prisoner</b></font>)</div><p/>The prisoner came forward directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)
will do very well. You have seen the worst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) agitation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) so
for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) stood,
half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) elbow against the bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Carton, still only half turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do you expect,
Mr. Darnay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The worst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their
withdrawing is in your favour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div><p/>Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no
more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other
in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above
them.

<p/>An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded
passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.
The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide
of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) along
with them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jerry! Jerry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) got
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, sir! It's a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) a paper through the throng. <div class="bookquote">``Quick! Have you got
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Hastily written on the paper was the word <div class="bookquote">``ACQUITTED.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had sent the message, `Recalled to Life,' again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>muttered
Jerry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) turned, <div class="bookquote">``I should have known what you meant, this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out
with a vehemence that nearly took him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) legs, and a loud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in
search of other carrion.




<p/>IV. Congratulatory


<p/>From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.
Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) escape from
death.

<p/>It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>)
twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
had not extended to the mournful cadence of his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) low grave voice, and
to the abstraction that overclouded him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) fitfully, without any apparent
reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) long
lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition
from the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) soul, it was also in its nature to arise of
itself, and to draw a gloom over him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>), as incomprehensible to those
unacquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
Bastille thrown upon him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) by a summer sun, when the substance was three
hundred miles away.

<p/>Only his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was the golden thread that united him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) to a Past beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>)
misery, and to a Present beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) misery: and the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) voice,
the light of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) face, the touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand, had a strong beneficial
influence with him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) almost always. Not absolutely always, for she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could
recall some occasions on which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) power had failed; but they were few
and slight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) believed them over.

<p/>Mr. Darnay had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned
to Mr. Stryver, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little
more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was, stout,
loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
way of shouldering himself -LRB-morally and physically-RRB- into companies and
conversations, that argued well for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) shouldering his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way up in life.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) wig and gown on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) said, squaring himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)
late client to that degree that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean
out of the group: <div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.
Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the
less likely to succeed on that account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,''
 (<font color='red'><b>client</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) late client, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as
another man's, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, <div class="bookquote">``Much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry
said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver. <div class="bookquote">``Well! you have been present all day,
and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And as such,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had
now shouldered back into the group, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had previously shouldered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) out of it--<div class="bookquote">``as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up
this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.
Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``I have a night's work to
do yet. Speak for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``and for Mr. Darnay, and for
Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) the question pointedly, and with a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) father.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at
Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,
not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
thoughts had wandered away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>said Lucie, softly laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go home, my father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a long breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) answered <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
impression--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) himself had originated--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would not be
released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the
passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,
and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of
gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.
Walking between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into
the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter
departed in it.

<p/>Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way back
to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or
interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning
against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) now
stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's
proceedings; nobody had known of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) was unrobed, and was none the
better for it in appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the
business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business
appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, <div class="bookquote">``You have mentioned that before,
sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We
have to think of the House more than ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ know, _I_ know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be
nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,
I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And indeed, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I really don't
know what you have to do with the matter. If you'll excuse me, as very
much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your
business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Carton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity you have not, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you would attend to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord love you, no!--I shouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Carton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) indifference,
<div class="bookquote">``business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.
Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance
for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!
I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
life.--Chair there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.
Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's. Carton,
who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
then, and turned to Darnay:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must
be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on
these street stones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly seem yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>returned Charles Darnay, <div class="bookquote">``to belong to this world
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far
advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to think I _am_ faint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or
some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) down Ludgate-hill to
Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were
shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat
opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) at the same table, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) separate bottle of port
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) fully half-insolent manner upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.
Darnay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
mended as to feel that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be an immense satisfaction!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) said it bitterly, and filled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) glass again: which was a large
one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we
are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are
not much alike in any particular, you and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) being there with
this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was
at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now your dinner is done,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Carton presently said, <div class="bookquote">``why don't you call a
health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What health? What toast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I'll
swear it's there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>Looking his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) companion full in the face while he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) drank the toast, Carton
flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) glass over his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to
pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) said, filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) new goblet.

<p/>A slight frown and a laconic <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were the answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it
feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such
sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Darnay answered not a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Not
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) showed she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was pleased, but I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this
disagreeable companion had, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own free will, assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in the
strait of the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the careless rejoinder.
<div class="bookquote">``It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did
it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I particularly like you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Mr. Carton,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other, oddly disconcerted, <div class="bookquote">``I have
not asked myself the question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But ask yourself the question now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ don't think I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton. <div class="bookquote">``I begin to have a very good
opinion of your understanding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, <div class="bookquote">``there is
nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
parting without ill-blood on either side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Carton rejoining, <div class="bookquote">``Nothing in life!''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>Darnay rang. <div class="bookquote">``Do you call the whole
reckoning?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) answering in the affirmative, <div class="bookquote">``Then
bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at
ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) good night.
Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat
of defiance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) manner, and said, <div class="bookquote">``A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think
I am drunk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think? You know I have been drinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since I must say so, I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I
care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don't let your sober face elate you,
however; you don't know what it may come to. Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a
glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you particularly like the man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) muttered, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own image; <div class="bookquote">``why
should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing
in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have
made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shows you
what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change
places with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was? Come on, and
have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) resorted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few
minutes, and fell asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) arms, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hair straggling over the
table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).




<p/>V. The Jackal


<p/>Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is
the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate
statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
in the course of a night, without any detriment to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reputation as a
perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.
The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.
Stryver, already fast shouldering his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way to a large and lucrative
practice, behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) compeers in this particular, any more than in the
drier parts of the legal race.

<p/>A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had
begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite,
specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the
visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the
florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of
the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.

<p/>It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib
man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments.
But, a remarkable improvement came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) as to this. The more
business he (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) got, the greater his (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow; and however late at night he (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) sat carousing with Sydney
Carton, he (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) always had his (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) points at his (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) fingers' ends in the morning.

<p/>Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great
ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,
might have floated a king's ship. Stryver never had a case in hand,
anywhere, but Carton was there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) pockets, staring
at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about,
among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton
would never be a lion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) was an amazingly good jackal, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>)
rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten o’clock, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man sir</b></font>)</div>said the man at the tavern, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had charged to
wake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``ten o’clock, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_What's_ the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten o’clock, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean? Ten o’clock at night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I remember. Very well, very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man
dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up, tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat on, and walked out. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned into the Temple,
and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's
Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.

<p/>The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) slippers on,
and a loose bed-gown, and his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) throat was bare for his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) greater ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>)
had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
may be observed in all free livers of his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) class, from the portrait of
Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of
Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a little late, Memory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers,
where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in
the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon
it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day's client; or
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) dine--it's all one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the
identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have
been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Stryver laughed till he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) precocious paunch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the jackal</b></font>)</div><p/>Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) dress, went into an adjoining
room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel
or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them
out, he (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) folded them on his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down
at the table, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Now I am ready!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver,
gaily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) looked among his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) papers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only two sets of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me the worst first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There they are, Sydney. Fire away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the jackal</b></font>)</div><p/>The lion then composed himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) back on a sofa on one side of the
drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) own paper-bestrewn table
proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to
his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in
a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) hands in
his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some
lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,
so deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) task, that his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) eyes did not even follow the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>)
stretched out for his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) glass--which often groped about, for a minute or
more, before it found the glass for his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) lips. Two or three times, the
matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on
him (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) to get up, and steep his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the
jug and basin, he (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) anxious
gravity.

<p/>At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and
proceeded to offer it to him (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>). The lion took it with care and caution,
made his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) selections from it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) remarks upon it, and the jackal
assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>)
hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then
invigorated himself with a bumper for his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) throttle, and a fresh application
to his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;
this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Stryver.

<p/>The jackal removed the towels from his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) head, which had been steaming
again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses
to-day. Every question told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always am sound; am I not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to
it and smooth it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the jackal</b></font>)</div><p/>With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, nodding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) head over him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) reviewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) in the present and the past, <div class="bookquote">``the
old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
now in despondency!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other, sighing: <div class="bookquote">``yes! The same Sydney, with the same
luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows. It was my way, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) sat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) legs stretched out before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>), looking at the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carton,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) friend, squaring himself at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) with a bullying air,
as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney
Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) into it, <div class="bookquote">``your way
is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look
at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, botheration!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Sydney, with a lighter and more
good-humoured laugh, <div class="bookquote">``don't _you_ be moral!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How have I done what I have done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``how do I do what I
do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it's not worth
your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to
do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Carton. At this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) laughed again, and they both laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pursued Carton, <div class="bookquote">``you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,
picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we
didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always
nowhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And whose fault was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always
driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It's a gloomy
thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking.
Turn me in some other direction before I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, holding up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) glass. <div class="bookquote">``Are you turned in a pleasant direction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Apparently not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) became gloomy again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty witness,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) muttered, looking down into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) glass. <div class="bookquote">``I have had
enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)_ pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, man alive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was the admiration of the whole Court!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge
of beauty? She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was a golden-haired doll!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Sydney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) with sharp eyes,
and slowly drawing a hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) florid face: <div class="bookquote">``do you know, I rather
thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,
and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a
yard or two of a man's nose, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can see it without a perspective-glass.
I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I'll have no more drink;
I'll get to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) host followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) out on the staircase with a candle, to light
him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
windows. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the
dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a
lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.

<p/>Waste forces within him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>), and a desert all around, this man stood still
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the
wilderness before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and
perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
from which the loves and graces looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), gardens in which the
fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight.
A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
houses, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw himself down in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes on a neglected bed, and its
pillow was wet with wasted tears.

<p/>Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
incapable of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own help and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own happiness, sensible of the blight
on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and resigning himself to let it eat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away.




<p/>VI. Hundreds of People


<p/>The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the
waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried
it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lived,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into
business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the
quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) life.

<p/>On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in
the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine
Sundays, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was accustomed to be with
them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and
generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) happened to have
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the
Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them.

<p/>A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be
found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of
the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,
north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers
grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a
consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,
instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which
the peaches ripened in their season.

<p/>The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.

<p/>There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In
a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all
visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray
workman putting his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind
the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way
from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.

<p/>Doctor Manette received such patients here as his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) old reputation, and
its revival in the floating whispers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) story, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) scientific knowledge, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) otherwise into moderate request, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) earned as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wanted.

<p/>These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and
notice, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
on the fine Sunday afternoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor Manette at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Expected home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Lucie at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Expected home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Pross at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>handmaid</b></font>)</div><p/>Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the
fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I am at home myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
birth, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off
by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,
that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the
rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,
the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by
delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in
themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry
stood looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>),
with something of that peculiar expression which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew so well by this
time, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) approved?

<p/>There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) detected all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), walked from one to another. The first was
the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books,
and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's
bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looking about, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) keeps
that reminder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sufferings about him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why wonder at that?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was the abrupt inquiry that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) start.

<p/>It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose
acquaintance he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and
had since improved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! You'd have thought!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to
express that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) no malice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am pretty well, I thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; <div class="bookquote">``how
are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing to boast of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross. <div class="bookquote">``I am very much put out about my
Ladybird.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For gracious sake say something else besides `indeed,' or you'll
fidget me to death,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross: whose character -LRB-dissociated from
stature-RRB- was shortness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, is bad enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``but better. Yes, I am
very much put out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask the cause?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to
come here looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hundreds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.

<p/>It was characteristic of this lady -LRB-as of some other people before her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
time and since-RRB- that whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) original proposition was questioned,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) exaggerated it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could think of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and
paid me for it; which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) certainly should never have done, you may take
your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
for nothing--since she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was ten years old. And it's really very hard,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.

<p/>Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head;
using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
fit anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
are always turning up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross. <div class="bookquote">``When you began it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ began it, Miss Pross?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you? Who brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) father to life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>), for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) -LRB-I could have forgiven
him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)-RRB-, to take Ladybird's affections away from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) also knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) by
this time to be, beneath the service of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eccentricity, one of those
unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and
admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost
it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew enough of the world to know that there
is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had such an exalted
respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own
mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stationed Miss
Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Pross; <div class="bookquote">``and that was my brother Solomon, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) hadn't made a
mistake in life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had
established the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel
who had stripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) of everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) possessed, as a stake to
speculate with, and had abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) poverty for evermore, with
no touch of compunction. Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon
-LRB-deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake-RRB- was quite a serious
matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) good opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of
business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had
sat down there in friendly relations, <div class="bookquote">``let me ask you--does the Doctor,
in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Pross, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't say he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) don't
refer to it within himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) thinks of it much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you imagine--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) up
short with:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
sometimes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now and then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
bright eye, as it looked kindly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that Doctor Manette has any
theory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) own, preserved through all those years, relative to
the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
oppressor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a
mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dull?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.

<p/>Rather wishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, <div class="bookquote">``No, no,
no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor
Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now
intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) is so devotedly
attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)? Believe me, Miss
Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of
zealous interest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) is afraid
of the whole subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's plain enough, I should think, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) may be. It's a dreadful
remembrance. Besides that, his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) loss of himself grew out of it. Not
knowing how he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) lost himself, or how he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) recovered himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) may never
feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn't make the
subject pleasant, I should think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. <div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss
Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression
always shut up within him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't be helped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Touch that
string, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.
In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) gets up in
the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking
up and down, walking up and down, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) room. Ladybird has learnt to
know then that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) old prison. She (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hurries to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and they go on together, walking up
and down, walking up and down, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is composed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) never says
a word of the true reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) restlessness, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) finds it
best not to hint at it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). In silence they go walking up and down
together, walking up and down together, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) love and company have
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own imagination, there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) possessing such a thing.

<p/>The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
<div class="bookquote">``and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a
peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fancied
they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though
the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross
was ready at the street door to receive them.

<p/>Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking
off her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) darling's bonnet when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) came up-stairs, and touching it up
with the ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and
folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) rich hair with
as much pride as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) could possibly have taken in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own hair if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) darling was a pleasant
sight too, embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) and thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and protesting against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) taking so much trouble for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)--which last she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) only dared to do
playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own
chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
them, and telling Miss Pross how she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
beaming at all this in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) little wig, and thanking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bachelor
stars for having lighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) declining years to a Home. But, no
Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain
for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction.

<p/>Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of
the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
always acquitted herself marvellously. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) dinners, of a very modest
quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
better. Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
impart culinary mysteries to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>). From these decayed sons and daughters
of Gaul, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) as quite a Sorceress,
or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Godmother</b></font>)
pleased.

<p/>On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days
persisted in taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
regions, or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
which no one but her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,
Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.

<p/>It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
there in the air. As everything turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), and revolved about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>),
they went out under the plane-tree, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) carried the wine down for
the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had installed herself, some
time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
plane-tree, talking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) glass replenished. Mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads.

<p/>Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
was only One.

<p/>Doctor Manette received him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross
suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
retired into the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) called it, in familiar conversation, <div class="bookquote">``a fit of the
jerks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) best condition, and looked specially young. The
resemblance between him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as
they sat side by side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) shoulder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) resting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) arm on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) chair, it was very agreeable to trace the

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
vivacity. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, Doctor Manette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the
plane-tree--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
which happened to be the old buildings of London--<div class="bookquote">``have you seen much of
the Tower?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of
it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ have been there, as you remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay, with a smile,
though reddening a little angrily, <div class="bookquote">``in another character, and not in a
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a
curious thing when I was there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>Lucie asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which
had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of
its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone
in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to
execution, had cut as his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) last work, three letters. They were done with
some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.
At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or
legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested
that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The
floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the
earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found
the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lucie, <div class="bookquote">``you are ill!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had suddenly started up, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) head. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) manner and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) look quite terrified them all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they
made me start. We had better go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large
drops, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) showed the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hand with rain-drops on it. But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
either detected, or fancied it detected, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face, as it turned
towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
when it turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in the passages of the Court House.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stopped under it to remark to them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
was not yet proof against slight surprises -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) ever would be-RRB-, and
that the rain had startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/>Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>)
made only Two.

<p/>The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was
done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the
heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father; Darnay sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>); Carton
leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of
the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the
ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div>said Doctor
Manette. <div class="bookquote">``It comes slowly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It comes surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton.

<p/>They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a
dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.

<p/>There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes
resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a
footstep was there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay, when they had
listened for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>asked Lucie. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes, I have
sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of
a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
solemn--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we
originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have
sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made
the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
by-and-bye into our lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sydney Carton struck in, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) moody way.

<p/>The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more
rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,
as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some
coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in
the distant streets, and not one within sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or
are we to divide them among us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
into my life, and my father's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take them into mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton. <div class="bookquote">``_I_ ask no questions and make no
stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,
and I see them--by the Lightning.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) added the last words, after there
had been a vivid flash which had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) lounging in the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hear them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) added again, after a peal of thunder. <div class="bookquote">``Here they
come, fast, fierce, and furious!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the rush and roar of rain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) typified, and it stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>),
for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and
lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's
interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at
midnight.

<p/>The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when
Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set
forth on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches
of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was
usually performed a good two hours earlier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``to
bring the dead out of their graves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don't expect to--what
would do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>answered Jerry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, Mr. Carton,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man of business. <div class="bookquote">``Good night, Mr.
Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,
bearing down upon them, too.




<p/>VII. Monseigneur in Town


<p/>Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
fortnightly reception in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) inner room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
was about to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many
things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
rapidly swallowing France; but, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) morning's chocolate could not so
much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four
strong men besides the Cook.

<p/>Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the
Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>)
pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to
conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips. One lacquey carried
the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed
the chocolate with the little instrument he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) bore for that function;
a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) of the two gold
watches-RRB-, poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to
dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) high
place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) escutcheon if his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
men; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) must have died of two.

<p/>Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy
and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at
a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so
impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far
more influence with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance
for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly
favoured!--always was for England -LRB-by way of example-RRB-, in the regretted
days of the merry Stuart who sold it.

<p/>Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which
was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) way--tend to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) own power and pocket. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) pleasures, general and
particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world
was made for them. The text of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) order -LRB-altered from the original
by only a pronoun, which is not much-RRB- ran: <div class="bookquote">``The earth and the fulness
thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) affairs, both private and public; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) had, as to both classes of
affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances
public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and
must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances
private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after
generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence
Monseigneur had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) sister from a convent, while there was yet
time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could
wear, and had bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with
a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer
rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior
mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) own wife included, looked
down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) with the loftiest contempt.

<p/>A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) halls, six body-women
waited on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
forage where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) matrimonial
relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality
among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.

<p/>For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with
every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any
reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere -LRB-and not
so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both-RRB-, they would
have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have
been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers
destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;
civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the
worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;
all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in
pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the
score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,
yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives
passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were
no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly
patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had
discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving
Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this
wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of
the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been
since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of
exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various
notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies
among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half
of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among
the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) manners and
appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of
bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far
towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing
known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,
and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
supped as at twenty.

<p/>The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that
things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting
them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic
sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves
whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the
spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
Future, for Monseigneur's guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other
three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
jargon about <div class="bookquote">``the Centre of Truth:''  (<font color='red'><b>these Dervishes</b></font>)</div>holding that Man had got out of the
Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got
out of the Circumference, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was to be kept from flying out of
the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,
by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much
discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never
became manifest.

<p/>But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been
ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally
correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such
delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant
swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would
surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen
of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) devouring hunger far away.

<p/>Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through
Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals
of Justice, and all society -LRB-except the scarecrows-RRB-, the Fancy Ball
descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was
required to officiate <div class="bookquote">``frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,
and white silk stockings.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Executioner</b></font>)</div>At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a
rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his (<font color='blue'><b>Executioner</b></font>) brother
Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call
him (<font color='blue'><b>Executioner</b></font>), presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at
Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled
hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would
see the very stars out!

<p/>Monseigneur having eased his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) four men of their burdens and taken his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>)
chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and
fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in
body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never
troubled it.

<p/>Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one
happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably
passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of
Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due
course of time got himself shut up in his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) sanctuary by the chocolate
sprites, and was seen no more.

<p/>The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon
but one person left of all the crowd, and he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) hat under his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) arm
and his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) snuff-box in his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)
way out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I devote you,''  (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div>said this person, stopping at the last door on his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) way,
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, <div class="bookquote">``to the Devil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div><p/>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) shook the snuff from his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) fingers as if he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) had shaken the
dust from his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) feet, and quietly walked downstairs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and
with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every
feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,
beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top
of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little
change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing
colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of
treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with
attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much
too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a
handsome face, and a remarkable one.

<p/>Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) carriage, and
drove away. Not many people had talked with him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) at the reception; he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had
stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer
in his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable
to him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to see the common people dispersed before his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) horses, and
often barely escaping from being run down. His (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) man drove as if he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) were
charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had
sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,
that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician
custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second
time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were
left to get out of their difficulties as they could.

<p/>With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of
consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage
dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming
before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its
wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a
number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.

<p/>But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have
stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded
behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,
and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has gone wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur, calmly looking out.

<p/>A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was
down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!''  (<font color='red'><b>a man child</b></font>)</div>said a ragged and submissive man, <div class="bookquote">``it is
a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) make that abominable noise? Is it his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,
into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly
got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the
Marquis clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand for an instant on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) sword-hilt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Killed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at
their length above his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) head, and staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The people</b></font>)</div><p/>The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was
nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) but watchfulness
and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the
people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they
remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat
and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) eyes
over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) purse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is extraordinary to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that you people cannot take care
of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in
the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The
tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, <div class="bookquote">``Dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest
made way. On seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the miserable creature fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder,
sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were
stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They
were as silent, however, as the men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know all, I know all,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the last comer. <div class="bookquote">``Be a brave man, my
Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to
live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour
as happily?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a philosopher, you there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``How do
they call you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They call me Defarge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what trade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis,
throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) another gold coin, <div class="bookquote">``and spend it as you will. The horses
there; are they right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the
Marquis leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) seat, and was just being driven away with the
air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had
paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) ease was suddenly
disturbed by a coin flying into his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) carriage, and ringing on its floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold!''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur the Marquis. <div class="bookquote">``Hold the horses! Who threw that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a
moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face on
the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was the
figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You dogs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,
except as to the spots on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nose: <div class="bookquote">``I would ride over any of you very
willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal
threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he (<font color='blue'><b>brigand</b></font>)
should be crushed under the wheels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of
what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not
a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.
But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the
Marquis in the face. It was not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) dignity to notice it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
contemptuous eyes passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and over all the other rats; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) seat again, and gave the word <div class="bookquote">``Go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats
had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking
on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the
spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through
which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bundle and
bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle
while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running
of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who
had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness
of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran
into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,
time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together
in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all
things ran their course.




<p/>VIII. Monseigneur in the Country


<p/>A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On
inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent
tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected
disposition to give up, and wither away.

<p/>Monsieur the Marquis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) travelling carriage -LRB-which might have been
lighter-RRB-, conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up
a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was
no impeachment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) high breeding; it was not from within; it was
occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) control--the setting
sun.

<p/>The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. <div class="bookquote">``It will
die out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the
heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow
left when the drag was taken off.

<p/>But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a
church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a
fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects
as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was
coming near home.

<p/>The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor
tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor
fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All
its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,
shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the
fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of
the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,
were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax
for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be
paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until
the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.

<p/>Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,
their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest
terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;
or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.

<p/>Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) postilions'
whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the
fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow
sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the
meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
truth through the best part of a hundred years.

<p/>Monsieur the Marquis cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) eyes over the submissive faces that
drooped before him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), as the like of himself had drooped before
Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces
drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender
of the roads joined the group.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring me hither that fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis to the courier.

<p/>The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round
to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I passed you on the road?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, it is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you look at, so fixedly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, I looked at the man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) stooped a little, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) tattered blue cap pointed under the
carriage. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) fellows stooped to look under the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What man, pig? And why look there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon, Monseigneur; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>demanded the traveller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, the man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You
know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your clemency, Monseigneur! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not of this part of the country. Of
all the days of my life, I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head hanging over--like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
face thrown up to the sky, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) head hanging down; then recovered
himself, fumbled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) cap, and made a bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,
white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all
eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had any spectre on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
conscience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, you did well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to see a thief accompanying my carriage,
and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) aside, Monsieur
Gabelle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary
united; he (<font color='blue'><b>Postmaster</b></font>) had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Postmaster</b></font>) arm in an
official manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! Go aside!''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Gabelle/Gabelle</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Gabelle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lay hands on this stranger if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) seeks to lodge in your village
to-night, and be sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) business is honest, Gabelle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>some friends</b></font>)</div><p/>The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
particular friends, pointing out the chain with his (<font color='blue'><b>Postmaster</b></font>) blue cap. Some
half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him (<font color='blue'><b>Postmaster</b></font>) out, and
presented him (<font color='blue'><b>Postmaster</b></font>) breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as
a person plunges into the river.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See to it, Gabelle. Go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The half-dozen</b></font>)</div><p/>The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or
they might not have been so fortunate.

<p/>The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer
gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the
points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the
courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.

<p/>At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,
with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor
figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) had
studied the figure from the life--his (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) own life, maybe--for it was
dreadfully spare and thin.

<p/>To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head as the carriage came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), rose quickly, and
presented herself at the carriage-door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>With an exclamation of impatience, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) unchangeable face,
Monseigneur looked out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How, then! What is it? Always petitions!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>)
cannot pay something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) has paid all, Monseigneur. He (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! He (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) is quiet. Can I restore him (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) lies yonder, under a little heap of poor
grass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Again, well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked an old woman, but was young. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manner was one of passionate
grief; by turns she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) veinous and knotted hands together
with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly,
caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to
feel the appealing touch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of
want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Again, well? Can I feed them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. My petition is,
that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed
over him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to show where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly
forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I
shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they
are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur!
Monseigneur!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The valet</b></font>)</div><p/>The valet had put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away from the door, the carriage had broken into
a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was left far
behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) chateau.

<p/>The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>), and rose, as
the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group
at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid
of the blue cap without which he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) was nothing, still enlarged upon his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>)
man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they
could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled
in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more
stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
been extinguished.

<p/>The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,
was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged
for the light of a flambeau, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) carriage stopped, and the great door
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chateau was opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arrived from England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, not yet.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>IX. The Gorgon's Head


<p/>It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,
with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of
staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony
business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and
stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in
all directions. As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was
finished, two centuries ago.

<p/>Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau
preceded, went from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness
to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the
flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great
door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being
in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl's voice there was none,
save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of
those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then
heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.

<p/>The great door clanged behind him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a
hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;
grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a
peasant, gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) lord
was angry.

<p/>Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,
Monsieur the Marquis, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) flambeau-bearer going on before, went up
the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own private apartment of three rooms: his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) bed-chamber and two
others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon
the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries
befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.
The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;
but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
pages in the history of France.

<p/>A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round
room, in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers. A small
lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds
closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; <div class="bookquote">``they
said he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was not arrived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>Nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>); but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been expected with Monseigneur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! It is not probable he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the
table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
sumptuous and choice supper. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chair was opposite to the window, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) soup, and was raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) glass of Bordeaux to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
lips, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) put it down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) calmly asked, looking with attention at the
horizontal lines of black and stone colour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur? That?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The servant</b></font>)</div><p/>The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into
the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), looking round
for instructions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the imperturbable master. <div class="bookquote">``Close them again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) supper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was
half way through it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) again stopped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand,
hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the
front of the chateau.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask who is arrived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had been some few leagues behind
Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had diminished the distance
rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.
He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was to be told -LRB-said Monseigneur-RRB- that supper awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) then and
there, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was prayed to come to it. In a little while he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) came.
He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had been known in England as Charles Darnay.

<p/>Monseigneur received him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in a courtly manner, but they did not shake
hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You left Paris yesterday, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) said to Monseigneur, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
seat at table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday. And you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I come direct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been a long time coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary; I come direct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time
intending the journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been detained by'' (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>--the nephew stopped a moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
answer--<div class="bookquote">``various business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the polished uncle.

<p/>So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.
When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,
looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
fine mask, opened a conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
sustained me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to death,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle; <div class="bookquote">``it is not necessary to say, to death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>returned the nephew, <div class="bookquote">``whether, if it had carried me to
the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/>The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight
lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good
breeding that it was not reassuring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>pursued the nephew, <div class="bookquote">``for anything I know, you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
circumstances that surrounded me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle, pleasantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, however that may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>resumed the nephew, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) with
deep distrust, <div class="bookquote">``I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,
and would know no scruple as to means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend, I told you so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the
two marks. <div class="bookquote">``Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I recall it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical
instrument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In effect, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>pursued the nephew, <div class="bookquote">``I believe it to be at once your
bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
France here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not quite understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>returned the uncle, sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) coffee.
<div class="bookquote">``Dare I ask you to explain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would
have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle, with great calmness. <div class="bookquote">``For the honour
of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
Pray excuse me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before
yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>observed the nephew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not say happily, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>returned the uncle, with refined
politeness; <div class="bookquote">``I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for
consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence
your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,
at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle
aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that
might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted
-LRB-comparatively-RRB- to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such
things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right
of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room -LRB-my bedroom-RRB-,
one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) daughter--_his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)_ daughter? We have
lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the
assertion of our station, in these days, might -LRB-I do not go so far as
to say would, but might-RRB- cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very
bad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) head;
as elegantly despondent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself, that great means of regeneration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern
time also,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>said the nephew, gloomily, <div class="bookquote">``that I believe our name to be
more detested than any name in France.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle. <div class="bookquote">``Detestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>pursued the nephew, in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) former tone, <div class="bookquote">``a face I can
look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A compliment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``to the grandeur of the family,
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) legs.

<p/>But, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand, the fine mask looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,
and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of
indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear
and slavery, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>observed the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``will keep the dogs
obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>looking up to it, <div class="bookquote">``shuts
out the sky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) that night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) might have been at a loss to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own from
the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof
he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) vaunted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new
way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meanwhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``I will preserve the honour and repose
of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we
terminate our conference for the night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A moment more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An hour, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>said the nephew, <div class="bookquote">``we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits
of wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_We_ have done wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,
and delicately pointing, first to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew, then to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account
to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father's time, we did
a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father's time,
when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint
inheritor, and next successor, from himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Death has done that!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And has left me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>answered the nephew, <div class="bookquote">``bound to a system that is
frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last
look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to
redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seeking them from me, my nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) on the
breast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--<div class="bookquote">``you
will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) face, was
cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) stood looking
quietly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) snuff-box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand. Once again he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) on the breast, as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) finger were the fine point of
a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) ran him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) through the
body, and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have
lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had said it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better to be a rational creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) added then, after ringing a small
bell on the table, <div class="bookquote">``and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,
Monsieur Charles, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This property and France are lost to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>said the nephew, sadly; <div class="bookquote">``I
renounce them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It
is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed
to me from you, to-morrow--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--or twenty years hence--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do me too much honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis; <div class="bookquote">``still, I prefer that
supposition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to
relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,
under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,
mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,
and suffering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly -LRB-if such a thing is possible-RRB- from the
weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in
another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse
on it, and on all this land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle. <div class="bookquote">``Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new
philosophy, graciously intend to live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at
their backs, may have to do some day--work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In England, for example?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The
family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be
lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The
Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
valet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) observed then, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) calm face to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew
with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may
be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You
know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With a daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis. <div class="bookquote">``You are fatigued. Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) smiling face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
which struck the eyes and ears of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew forcibly. At the same
time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin
straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that
looked handsomely diabolic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>repeated the Marquis. <div class="bookquote">``A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So
commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). The nephew
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), in vain, in passing on to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night!''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle. <div class="bookquote">``I look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) bed, if you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
added to himself, before he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) rang his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) little bell again, and summoned his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
valet to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own bedroom.

<p/>The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still
night. Rustling about the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) softly-slippered feet making no
noise on the floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just
coming on.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) moved from end to end of his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the
scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) mind; the slow
toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the
prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at
the fountain, and the mender of roads with his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) blue cap pointing out the
chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the
tall man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms up, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am cool now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``and may go to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) thin
gauze curtains fall around him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) composed himself to sleep.

<p/>The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them.

<p/>For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,
stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,
taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and
the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and
freed.

<p/>The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark
hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,
and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.

<p/>Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water
of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces
crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the
weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur
the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.
At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open
mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.

<p/>Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement
windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth
shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely
lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the
fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men
and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows
out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church
and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter
prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot.

<p/>The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and
surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been
reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;
now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs
pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.

<p/>All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the
return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried
figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?

<p/>What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already
at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) day's dinner -LRB-not
much to carry-RRB- lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to
peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it
to a distance, dropped one over him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) as they sow chance seeds? Whether or
no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) life,
down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) got to the
fountain.

<p/>All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about
in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other
emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought
in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of
the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was
highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting
himself in the breast with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) blue cap. What did all this portend,
and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind
a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle
-LRB-double-laden though the horse was-RRB-, at a gallop, like a new version of
the German ballad of Leonora?

<p/>It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.

<p/>The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added
the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years.

<p/>It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine
mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the
heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt
was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drive him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) fast to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) tomb. This, from Jacques.''




 (<font color='red'><b>X.</b></font>)</div><p/>X. Two Promises


<p/>More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles
Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French
language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
would have been a Professor; in that age, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was a Tutor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) read with
young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
living tongue spoken all over the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) cultivated a taste for
its stores of knowledge and fancy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could write of them, besides, in
sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not
at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were
to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a
tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and
profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>)
work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became
known and encouraged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was well acquainted, more-over, with the
circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) country, and those were of ever-growing interest.
So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) prospered.

<p/>In London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor
to lie on beds of roses; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had had any such exalted expectation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
would not have prospered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had expected labour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) found it, and
did it and made the best of it. In this, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) prosperity consisted.

<p/>A certain portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) time was passed at Cambridge, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) time he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) passed in
London.

<p/>Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of the love of a
woman.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had never
heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) compassionate voice;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
confronted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had not yet spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on the subject; the assassination
at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,
long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had never yet, by so
much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) heart.

<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) reasons for this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) knew full well. It was again a
summer day when, lately arrived in London from his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) college occupation,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer
day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) found the Doctor reading in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) arm-chair at a window. The energy
which had at once supported him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was now a
very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
of resolution, and vigour of action. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) recovered energy he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had at first been in the
exercise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), now entered Charles Darnay, at
sight of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) book and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your
return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were
both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``Miss
Manette--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stopped short, <div class="bookquote">``and your return will
delight us all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) has gone out on some household matters, but will
soon be home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor Manette, I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was from home. I took the opportunity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)
being from home, to beg to speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a blank silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, with evident constraint. <div class="bookquote">``Bring your chair here,
and speak on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less
easy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) at length began, <div class="bookquote">``for some year and a half, that I hope the topic
on which I am about to touch may not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
had kept it so a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, drawing it back:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Lucie the topic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hard for me to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) at any time. It is very hard for me
to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor
Manette!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said deferentially.

<p/>There was another blank silence before her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) father rejoined:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
Darnay hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I go on, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Another blank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly
I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and
the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>). You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face turned away, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes bent on the
ground. At the last words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand again, hurriedly,
and cried:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles
Darnay's ears long after he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had ceased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) motioned with the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had
extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter
so received it, and remained silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
moments. <div class="bookquote">``I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) chair, but did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), or
raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) chin dropped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) white hair
overshadowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you spoken to Lucie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor written?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is
to be referred to your consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father thanks
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes did not go with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay, respectfully, <div class="bookquote">``how can I fail to know, Doctor
Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there
is, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
itself. I know that, as in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) childhood she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no parent, so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) present
years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from the world beyond this life, you could
hardly be invested, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sight, with a more sacred character than that
in which you are always with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I know that when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is clinging to
you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
neck. I know that in loving you she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees and loves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother broken-hearted,
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I
have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) father sat silent, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) face bent down. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) breathing was a
little quickened; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) repressed all other signs of agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) and you
with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as
long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even
now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>).
Heaven is my witness that I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) father, mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``I have thought so
before now. I believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, do not believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice
struck with a reproachful sound, <div class="bookquote">``that if my fortune were so cast as
that, being one day so happy as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) my wife, I must at any time
put any separation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) and you, I could or would breathe a
word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I
should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at
a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not
now touch this honoured hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own upon it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like
you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide
with Lucie her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
come in aid of it, and bind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) closer to you, if such a thing can be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) touch still lingered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) father's hand. Answering the touch for a
moment, but not coldly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) father rested his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands upon the arms of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference. A struggle was evidently in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face; a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank
you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have
you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None. As yet, none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
ascertain that, with my knowledge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
might -LRB-mistaken or not mistaken-RRB- have that hopefulness to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you seek any guidance from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it
in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you seek any promise from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do seek that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well
understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)
innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I
could retain no place in it against her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand equally well, that a word from her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father in any suitor's
favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason,
Doctor Manette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay, modestly but firmly, <div class="bookquote">``I would not ask that
word, to save my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one
respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask, sir, if you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) is--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hesitated, her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) father
supplied the rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is sought by any other suitor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is what I meant to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) father considered a little before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want
a promise from me. Tell me what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) own
part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will
bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you
may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The
condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
require, I will observe immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I give the promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, <div class="bookquote">``without any condition. I believe
your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I
believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self. If she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) should ever tell me
that you are essential to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) perfect happiness, I will give her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to you.
If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand gratefully; their hands were joined as
the Doctor spoke:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,
new or old, against the man she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) really loved--the direct responsibility
thereof not lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head--they should all be obliterated for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
sake. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me
than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>So strange was the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) faded into silence, and so strange
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) fixed look when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said something to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor Manette</b></font>)</div>said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile.
<div class="bookquote">``What was it you said to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was at a loss how to answer, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) remembered having spoken of a
condition. Relieved as his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) mind reverted to that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is
not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and
why I am in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor of Beauvais.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no
secret from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant, the Doctor even had his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) two hands at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ears; for
another instant, even had his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) two hands laid on Darnay's lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie
should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you
promise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Willingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me your hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) will be home directly, and it is better she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>It was dark when Charles Darnay left him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), and it was an hour later and
darker when Lucie came home; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hurried into the room alone--for
Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
reading-chair empty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Father dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing was said in answer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) heard a low hammering sound in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) looked in at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
blood all chilled, <div class="bookquote">``What shall I do! What shall I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) uncertainty lasted but a moment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hurried back, and tapped at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) door, and softly called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). The noise ceased at the sound of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) presently came out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and they walked up and down
together for a long time.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) came down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bed, to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) sleep that night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
slept heavily, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) tray of shoemaking tools, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) old unfinished
work, were all as usual.




<p/>XI. A Companion Picture


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sydney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>jackal</b></font>)</div><p/>Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,
and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making
a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before the setting in
of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
bring grist to the mill again.

<p/>Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)
through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
the towelling; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was in a very damaged condition, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) now pulled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) turban off and threw it into the basin in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver the portly, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) lay on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Do_ you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel disposed to say much. Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I know her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to guess, at five o’clock in the morning, with my brains
frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask
me to dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting
posture. <div class="bookquote">``Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
because you are such an insensible dog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, <div class="bookquote">``are such a
sensitive and poetical spirit--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, <div class="bookquote">``though I don't prefer
any claim to being the soul of Romance -LRB-for I hope I know better-RRB-, still
I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a luckier, if you mean that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say gallantry, while you are about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested Carton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! I'll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver,
inflating himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) friend as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) made the punch, <div class="bookquote">``who cares more to
be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
to be agreeable, in a woman's society, than you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney Carton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but before I go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) bullying
way, <div class="bookquote">``I'll have this out with you. You've been at Doctor Manette's house
as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your
moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,
Sydney!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to
be ashamed of anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Sydney; <div class="bookquote">``you ought to be much obliged
to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall not get off in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
rejoinder at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you
to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned
fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had made, and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, squaring himself; <div class="bookquote">``I have less need to make
myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.
Why do I do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw you do it yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>muttered Carton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do it because it's politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I
get on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Carton, with a careless air; <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would keep to that. As
to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) asked the question with some appearance of scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no business to be incorrigible,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) friend's answer,
delivered in no very soothing tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney Carton.
<div class="bookquote">``Who is the lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,
Sydney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, preparing him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) with ostentatious friendliness
for the disclosure he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was about to make, <div class="bookquote">``because I know you don't mean
half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I
make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to
me in slighting terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; and in these chambers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Sydney Carton looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) punch and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) complacent friend;
drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) punch and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) complacent friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young
lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a
little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I
think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion of
a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
of mine, who had no ear for music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you know all about it, Syd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care about
fortune: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to
please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``Why should I be
astonished?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You approve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``Why should I not approve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) friend Stryver, <div class="bookquote">``you take it more easily than I fancied
you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would
be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your
ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had
enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I
feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels
inclined to go to it -LRB-when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can stay away-RRB-, and I feel
that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me
credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to
say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you
know; you really are in a bad way. You don't know the value of money,
you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;
you really ought to think about a nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>The prosperous patronage with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) said it, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) look twice as
big as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was, and four times as offensive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, let me recommend you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>pursued Stryver, <div class="bookquote">``to look it in the face.
I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face,
you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of
you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor
understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some
respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way,
or lodging-letting way--and marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), against a rainy day. That's the
kind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney.




<p/>XII. The Fellow of Delicacy


<p/>Mr. Stryver having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) happiness known
to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental
debating of the point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) came to the conclusion that it would be as
well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange
at their leisure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) should give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand a week or two
before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
and Hilary.

<p/>As to the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had not a doubt about it, but clearly
saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly
grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a
plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) called himself for the
plaintiff, there was no getting over his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) evidence, the counsel for
the defendant threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) brief, and the jury did not even turn to
consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer
case could be.

<p/>Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal
proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to
Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) to present
himself in Soho, and there declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) noble mind.

<p/>Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way from the Temple,
while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.
Anybody who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) projecting himself into Soho while he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was yet
on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) full-blown way
along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have
seen how safe and strong he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) past Tellson's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) both banking at Tellson's and
knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.
Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness
of the Soho horizon. So, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pushed open the door with the weak rattle
in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient
cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.
Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
bars to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
under the clouds were a sum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do? I hope you are well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) always seemed too big for any
place, or space. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)
squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if
the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.

<p/>The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would
recommend under the circumstances, <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do
you do, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) manner
of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook
hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shook in a
self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co..

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Lorry, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
business character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
have come for a private word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, bending down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) ear, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eye strayed
to the House afar off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) arms confidentially on the
desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I am going to make an offer of myself
in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chin, and looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
visitor dubiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear me, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>repeated Stryver, drawing back. <div class="bookquote">``Oh dear you, sir?
What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My meaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the man of business, <div class="bookquote">``is, of course, friendly and
appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,
my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.
Stryver--''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in the oddest
manner, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) were compelled against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) will to add, internally,
<div class="bookquote">``you know there really is so much too much of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, slapping the desk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) contentious hand,
opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) eyes wider, and taking a long breath, <div class="bookquote">``if I understand you,
Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry adjusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) little wig at both ears as a means towards that
end, and bit the feather of a pen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D--n it all, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``am I not eligible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``If you say
eligible, you are eligible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I not prosperous?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>asked Stryver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And advancing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you come to advancing you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be
able to make another admission, <div class="bookquote">``nobody can doubt that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>demanded Stryver,
perceptibly crestfallen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! I--Were you going there now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Straight!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, with a plump of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fist on the desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver. <div class="bookquote">``Now, I'll put you in a corner,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>forensically
shaking a forefinger at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are a man of business and bound to
have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that I should succeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``D--n _me_!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>cried Stryver, <div class="bookquote">``but this beats everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
Stryver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_
a Bank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``and having summed up three leading reasons for
complete success, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says there's no reason at all! Says it with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
head on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had said it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) head off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and
when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of
causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young
lady, my good sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, <div class="bookquote">``the
young lady. The young lady goes before all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, squaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)
elbows, <div class="bookquote">``that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
present in question is a mincing Fool?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry,
reddening, <div class="bookquote">``that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose
taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a piece of my
mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's
blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) turn to be angry;
Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in
no better state now it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I mean to tell you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``Pray let there
be no mistake about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood
hitting a tune out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) teeth with it, which probably gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) the
toothache. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) broke the awkward silence by saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not
to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench
bar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all I can say of it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, <div class="bookquote">``that
this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now understand me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``As a man of business, I am
not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried
Miss Manette in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have
spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I
may not be right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, whistling. <div class="bookquote">``I can't undertake to find third
parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense
in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's
new to me, but you are right, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And
understand me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, <div class="bookquote">``I
will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any
gentleman breathing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There! I beg your pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be
painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor
Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You
know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with
the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you
in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its
soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
best spared. What do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long would you keep me in town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the
evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I say yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stryver: <div class="bookquote">``I won't go up there now, I am not so
hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
in to-night. Good morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a
concussion of air on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) passage through, that to stand up against it
bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength
of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were
always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly
believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in
the empty office until they bowed another customer in.

<p/>The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
gone so far in his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
moral certainty. Unprepared as he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) was for the large pill he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had to
swallow, he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) got it down. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)
forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, <div class="bookquote">``my way
out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) found
great relief. <div class="bookquote">``You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``I'll do that for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o’clock,
Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) mind than the subject of
the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) even showed surprise when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) saw Mr. Lorry, and was
altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>emissary</b></font>)</div>said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of
bootless attempts to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>) round to the question. <div class="bookquote">``I have been to
Soho.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Soho?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, to be sure! What am I
thinking of!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``that I was right in the
conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my
advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, <div class="bookquote">``that I
am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's
account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
us say no more about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>rejoined Stryver, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) head in a smoothing and
final way; <div class="bookquote">``no matter, no matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it does matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry urged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Having supposed that there was
sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is
not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is
done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have
repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish
aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been
a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am
glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing
for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could
have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not
proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means
certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to
that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and
giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you
will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,
I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,
and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;
you were right, it never would have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked quite stupidly at Mr.
Stryver shouldering him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) towards the door, with an appearance of
showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) erring head.
<div class="bookquote">``Make the best of it, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``say no more about it;
thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was. Mr. Stryver
was lying back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) sofa, winking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) ceiling.




<p/>XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy


<p/>If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) certainly never shone in the
house of Doctor Manette. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had been there often, during a whole year,
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
cared to talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
pierced by the light within him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).

<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) did care something for the streets that environed that house,
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no
transitory gladness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>); many a dreary daybreak revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) solitary
figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture
in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time
brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) more scantily than ever; and often when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had got up again, and haunted that
neighbourhood.

<p/>On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver -LRB-after notifying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) jackal
that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had thought better of that marrying matter'' (<font color='red'><b>jackal</b></font>)</div>-RRB- had carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)
delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health
for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod
those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) feet became
animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,
they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) to the Doctor's door.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) work, alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had
never been quite at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) ease with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and received him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) with some little
embarrassment as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) seated himself near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) table. But, looking up at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) observed
a change in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What
is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to
live no better life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows it is a shame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why not change it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Looking gently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was surprised and saddened to see that
there were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes. There were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) voice too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall
sink lower, and be worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) leaned an elbow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) table, and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand. The
table trembled in the silence that followed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) softened, and was much distressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) to
be so, without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of
what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
it would make me very glad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you for your sweet compassion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) unshaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face after a little while, and spoke steadily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid to hear me. Don't shrink from anything I say. I am like
one who died young. All my life might have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am
sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the
mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was pale and trembling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) relief with a fixed despair
of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
been holden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the
love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,
poor creature of misuse as you know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been
conscious this day and hour, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happiness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,
disgrace you, pull you down with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I know very well that you can have
no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall
you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your
confidence? I know this is a confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) modestly said, after a
little hesitation, and in earnest tears, <div class="bookquote">``I know you would say this to
no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very
little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that
you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not
been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this
home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had
died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that
I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from
old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I
have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off
sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all
a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lay down,
but I wish you to know that you inspired it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the
weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,
heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in
its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
service, idly burning away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy
than you were before you knew me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can
make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for
good, with you, at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come
here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,
the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;
and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
deplore and pity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with
all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,
and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let
me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life
was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
alone, and will be shared by no one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that will be a consolation to you, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carton,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) answered, after an agitated pause, <div class="bookquote">``the secret is
yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. And again, God bless you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) lips, and moved towards the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it
again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In
the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and
shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made
to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried
in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was so unlike what he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had ever shown himself to be, and it was so
sad to think how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had thrown away, and how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) every day kept
down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)
stood looking back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be comforted!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An
hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn
but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any
wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I
shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be
what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make
to you, is, that you will believe this of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, Mr. Carton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve
you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say
it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to
you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would
embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold
me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one
thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new
ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a
happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright
beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is
a man who would give his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, to keep a life you love beside you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Farewell!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said a last <div class="bookquote">``God bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).




<p/>XIV. The Honest Tradesman


<p/>To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) stool in
Fleet-street with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) grisly urchin beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), a vast number and
variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit
upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and
not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending
westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,
both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
the sun goes down!

<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) straw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,
like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,
since a small part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) income was derived from the pilotage of timid
women -LRB-mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life-RRB- from
Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have the honour of drinking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very good health. And it was from
the gifts bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) recruited his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) finances, as just now observed.

<p/>Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in
the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,
but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>).

<p/>It fell out that he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few, and belated women few, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) breast that Mrs.
Cruncher must have been <div class="bookquote">``flopping''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cruncher</b></font>)</div>in some pointed manner, when an
unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>)
attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
funeral, which engendered uproar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) offspring, <div class="bookquote">``it's a
buryin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hooroar, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Young</b></font>)</div>cried Young Jerry.

<p/>The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watched
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What d’ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey
to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for
_me_!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hooroars! Don't
let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D’ye
hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I warn't doing no harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>Young Jerry protested, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drop it then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher; <div class="bookquote">``I won't have none of _your_ no
harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing
round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach
there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were
considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position
appeared by no means to please him (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>), however, with an increasing rabble
surrounding the coach, deriding him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), making grimaces at him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), and
incessantly groaning and calling out: <div class="bookquote">``Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.

<p/>Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
always pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed
Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance
excited him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) greatly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) asked of the first man who ran against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, brother? What's it about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked another man. <div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returned the man, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth
nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
greatest ardour, <div class="bookquote">``Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled
against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and from this person he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned that the funeral was the
funeral of one Roger Cly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a spy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Cruncher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old Bailey spy,''  (<font color='red'><b>informant</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) informant. <div class="bookquote">``Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey
Spi--i--ies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) had
assisted. <div class="bookquote">``I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>). Dead, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead as mutton,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other, <div class="bookquote">``and can't be too dead. Have `em
out, there! Spies! Pull `em out, there! Spies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have `em out, and to pull `em out, mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd's opening the coach
doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands
for a moment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) was so alert, and made such good use of his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) time,
that in another moment he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) was scouring away up a bye-street, after
shedding his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
other symbolical tears.

<p/>These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a
crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.
They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being
much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers
was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) spiky head from
the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning
coach.

<p/>The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.
The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the
hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), under
close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended
by his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a
popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional
ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to
that part of the procession in which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) walked.

<p/>Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination
was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there
in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and
highly to its own satisfaction.

<p/>The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter
genius -LRB-or perhaps the same-RRB- conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of
window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy
and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had
been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm
the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were
coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps
the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual
progress of a mob.

<p/>Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained
behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
The place had a soothing influence on him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) procured a pipe from a
neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and
maturely considering the spot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) usual way,
<div class="bookquote">``you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>)
was a young `un and a straight made `un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Having smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) turned
himself about, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) might appear, before the hour of closing, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
station at Tellson's. Whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) meditations on mortality had touched
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) liver, or whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) general health had been previously at all
amiss, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) desired to show a little attention to an eminent
man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) made a short call upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) way back.

<p/>Young Jerry relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father with dutiful interest, and reported No
job in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the
usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son went home to tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I tell you where it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) wife, on
entering. <div class="bookquote">``If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I
shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you
for it just the same as if I seen you do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you're at it afore my face!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
angry apprehension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am saying nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.
You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Jerry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! It _is_
yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,
but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general
ironical dissatisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and your yes, Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) saucer. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! I think so. I believe you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going out to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) decent wife, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) took
another bite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go with you, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son, briskly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you mayn't. I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That's
where I'm going to. Going a fishing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you bring any fish home, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>returned that
gentleman, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``that's questions enough for you; I ain't a
going out, till you've been long abed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) in
conversation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) disadvantage. With this view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) urged his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) in
conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) could bring against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), rather than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for a moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own reflections. The devoutest
person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
honest prayer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) did in this distrust of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) wife. It was as if a
professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And mind you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher. <div class="bookquote">``No games to-morrow! If I, as a
honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none
of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring
on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
customer to you, if you don't. _I_`m your Rome, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) began grumbling again:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don't
know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by your
flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) _is_
your’n, ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,
and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boy out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) mother to
perform her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first duty, and, whatever else she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did or neglected, above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) other parent.

<p/>Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry
was ordered to bed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) mother, laid under similar injunctions,
obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes, and did not start upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) excursion until nearly one
o’clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) rose up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) chair,
took a key out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought
forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other
fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
in skilful manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
extinguished the light, and went out.

<p/>Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) went to
bed, was not long after his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father. Under cover of the darkness he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
court, followed out into the streets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was in no uneasiness concerning
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the
door stood ajar all night.

<p/>Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
walls, and doorways, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) eyes were close to one another, held his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not
gone far, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and
the two trudged on together.

<p/>Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a
lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,
that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) might have supposed the
second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split
himself into two.

<p/>The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low
brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which
the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.
Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that
Young Jerry saw, was the form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) honoured parent, pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands
and knees.

<p/>It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) did,
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking
in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard
that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church
tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not
creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to
fish.

<p/>They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.
Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) made off,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) hair as stiff as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father's.

<p/>But, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not
only stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) running away, but lured him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) back again. They
were still fishing perseveringly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) peeped in at the gate for
the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a
screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were
strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what
it would be; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) saw it, and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) honoured parent about to
wrench it open, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
made off again, and never stopped until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had run a mile or more.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,
it being a spectral sort of race that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) ran, and one highly desirable
to get to the end of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had a strong idea that the coffin he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had seen
was running after him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>); and, pictured as hopping on behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), bolt
upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
and hopping on at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) side--perhaps taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) arm--it was a pursuer to
shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it
was making the whole night behind him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) dreadful, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boy's Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways
too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him (<font color='blue'><b>Kite</b></font>) up. All this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him (<font color='blue'><b>Kite</b></font>), so that when the boy
got to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own door he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had reason for being half dead. And even then
it would not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but followed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) upstairs with a bump on every
stair, scrambled into bed with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breast when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fell asleep.

<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father in the
family room. Something had gone wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>); at least, so Young Jerry
inferred, from the circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) holding Mrs. Cruncher by the
ears, and knocking the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head against the head-board of the
bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you I would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``and I did.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>said Jerry, <div class="bookquote">``and me
and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I try to be a good wife, Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the poor woman protested, with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) business? Is it obeying your
husband to disobey him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on the wital subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's enough for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``to be the wife of a
honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) took to his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) trade or when he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) didn't. A honouring and obeying
wife would let his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious
woman? If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have
no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has
of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in
the honest tradesman's kicking off his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) clay-soiled boots, and lying down
at his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) lying on
his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) rusty hands under his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) head for a pillow, his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) son lay
down too, and fell asleep again.

<p/>There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.
Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) should observe any symptoms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) saying Grace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) was brushed
and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son to pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
ostensible calling.

<p/>Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) arm at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father's side
along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) of the previous night, running home through darkness and
solitude from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) grim pursuer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) cunning was fresh with the day,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not
improbable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,
that fine morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep
at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: <div class="bookquote">``what's a
Resurrection-Man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``How
should I know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you knowed everything, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the artless boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hem! Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
hat to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) spikes free play, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s a tradesman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) goods, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Young</b></font>)</div>asked the brisk Young Jerry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) goods,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">``is a
branch of Scientific goods.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the lively boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it is something of that sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite
growed up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head in a dubious and moral way.
<div class="bookquote">``It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop
your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and
there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
for.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,
to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to
himself: <div class="bookquote">``Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will
yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>XV. Knitting


<p/>There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
Defarge. As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No
vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
the dregs of it.

<p/>This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been
early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun
on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early
brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and
slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could
not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These
were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy
looks.

<p/>Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop
was not visible. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the
threshold looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), nobody asked for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), nobody wondered to see
only Madame Defarge in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) seat, presiding over the distribution of
wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), as much defaced
and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.

<p/>A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's
gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built
towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her (<font color='blue'><b>spies</b></font>) sleeve
with her (<font color='blue'><b>spies</b></font>) toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
a long way off.

<p/>Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>), until midday. It was
high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) streets and under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a
mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered
the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had
followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though
the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day, gentlemen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Defarge.

<p/>It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited
an answering chorus of <div class="bookquote">``Good day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is bad weather, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.

<p/>Upon which, every man looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour, and then all cast down
their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: <div class="bookquote">``I have
travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
Jacques. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>)--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) to
drink, my wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the
mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) blue cap to the company,
and drank. In the breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) blouse he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) carried some coarse dark
bread; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near
Madame Defarge's counter. A third man got up and went out.

<p/>Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took less
than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) breakfast.
He (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>); not even
Madame Defarge, who had taken up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) knitting, and was at work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you finished your repast, friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) asked, in due season.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a
courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the
staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man
sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.

<p/>No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had
gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired
man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through the chinks in the wall.

<p/>Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness
encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) will tell you all.
Speak, Jacques Five!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swarthy forehead with
it, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Where shall I commence, monsieur?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Commence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, <div class="bookquote">``at the
commencement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) then, messieurs,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>began the mender of roads, <div class="bookquote">``a year ago this
running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the
chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun
going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
hanging by the chain--like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) village
during a whole year.

<p/>Jacques One struck in, and asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) had ever seen the man before?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>answered the mender of roads, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) perpendicular.

<p/>Jacques Three demanded how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) afterwards recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) then?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) tall figure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mender of roads, softly, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>)
finger at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) nose. ``When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,
`Say, what is he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) like?' I make response, `Tall as a spectre.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have said, short as a dwarf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques</b></font>)</div>returned Jacques Two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>)
confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not
offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) finger,
standing near our little fountain, and says, `To me! Bring that rascal!'
My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) is right there, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>murmured Defarge, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) who had
interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``Go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. <div class="bookquote">``The tall man
is lost, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter, the number,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is well hidden, but at last
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is unluckily found. Go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to
go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see
coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms bound--tied to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sides--like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) indispensable cap, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) represented a man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
elbows bound fast at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hips, with cords that were knotted behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass -LRB-for it is a solitary road, that, where any
spectacle is well worth looking at-RRB-, and at first, as they approach, I
see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and
that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun
going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that
their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves
with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near
to me, I recognise the tall man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognises me. Ah, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as
on the evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and I first encountered, close to the same spot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) described it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were there, and it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw it
vividly; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen much in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not
show the soldiers that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with
our eyes. `Come on!' says the chief of that company, pointing to the
village, `bring him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fast to his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) tomb!' and they bring him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) faster. I
follow. His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) wooden
shoes are large and clumsy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) is lame. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) is lame, and
consequently slow, they drive him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) with their guns--like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the
butt-ends of muskets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) falls. They
laugh and pick him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) up again. His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) face is bleeding and covered with dust,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) into
the village; all the village runs to look; they take him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) past the mill,
and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the
darkness of the night, and swallow him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)--like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth as wide as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, and shut it with a sounding
snap of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth. Observant of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unwillingness to mar the effect by
opening it again, Defarge said, <div class="bookquote">``Go on, Jacques.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the village,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low
voice, <div class="bookquote">``withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,
except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating
my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on
my way to my work. There I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>), high up, behind the bars of a lofty
iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) has no
hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) regards me like a
dead man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all
of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the
countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One
and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) chin resting on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally
intent, on one knee behind them, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) agitated hand always gliding
over the network of fine nerves about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) mouth and nose; Defarge
standing between them and the narrator, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) had stationed in the
light of the window, by turns looking from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) to them, and from them to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) remains up there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) iron cage some days. The village looks
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a
distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work
of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all
faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards
the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They
whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) will not be
executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) was enraged and made mad by the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) child; they say
that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?
It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen then, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Number One of that name sternly interposed.
<div class="bookquote">``Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,
yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) carriage in the street,
sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the
hazard of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in
his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And once again listen, Jacques!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the kneeling Number Three:
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a
strikingly greedy air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) hungered for something--that was neither
food nor drink; <div class="bookquote">``the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,
and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) blows. You hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear, messieurs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,''  (<font color='red'><b>the countryman</b></font>)</div>resumed the
countryman, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) is brought down into our country to be executed on
the spot, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) will very certainly be executed. They even whisper
that because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the
father of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) tenants--serfs--what you will--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) will be executed as a
parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand, armed
with the knife, will be burnt off before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face; that, into wounds
which will be made in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs, there will be
poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man
says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lies?
I am not a scholar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the countryman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen once again then, Jacques!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man air</b></font>)</div>said the man with the restless hand
and the craving air. <div class="bookquote">``The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was
all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and
nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than
the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager
attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was
done--why, how old are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty-five,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, with grim impatience. <div class="bookquote">``Long live the Devil! Go
on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;
even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday
night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.
Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by
the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the
water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,
and pointed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers
have marched into the prison in the night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldiers</b></font>) is in the midst
of many soldiers. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldiers</b></font>) is bound as before, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldiers</b></font>) mouth there is
a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him (<font color='blue'><b>soldiers</b></font>) look almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>soldiers</b></font>)
laughed.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suggested it, by creasing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two thumbs,
from the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``On the top of the gallows is
fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldiers</b></font>) is hanged
there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked at one another, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue cap to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face,
on which the perspiration had started afresh while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recalled the
spectacle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw
water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have
I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to
bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,
across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,
messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The hungry man gnawed one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at the other
three, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger quivered with the craving that was on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all, messieurs. I left at sunset -LRB-as I had been warned to do-RRB-,
and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met -LRB-as I was
warned I should-RRB- this comrade. With him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>), I came on, now riding and now
walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here
you see me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div><p/>After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, <div class="bookquote">``Good! You have acted
and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the
door?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the
top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.

<p/>The three had risen, and their heads were together when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) came back to
the garret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How say you, Jacques?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>demanded Number One. <div class="bookquote">``To be registered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be registered, as doomed to destruction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>returned Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Magnificent!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>croaked the man with the craving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The chateau, and all the race?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The chateau and all the race,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>returned Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Extermination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, <div class="bookquote">``Magnificent!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>and began
gnawing another finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques Two</b></font>)</div>asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, <div class="bookquote">``that no embarrassment
can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is
safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always
be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>returned Defarge, drawing himself up, <div class="bookquote">``if madame my wife
undertook to keep the register in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) memory alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not lose
a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own stitches and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
own symbols, it will always be as plain to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as the sun. Confide in
Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) name or
crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who
hungered, asked: <div class="bookquote">``Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) is
very simple; is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) not a little dangerous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) knows nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``at least nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>); let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) remain with me; I will take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>), and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>)
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and
Court; let him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) see them on Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the hungry man, staring. <div class="bookquote">``Is it a good sign, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) natural prey, if you wish
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) to bring it down one day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already
dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the
pallet-bed and take some rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed no persuasion, and was soon
asleep.

<p/>Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found
in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious
dread of madame by which he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was constantly haunted, his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) life was very
new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) counter, so expressly
unconscious of him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), and so particularly determined not to perceive that
his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) shook in his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) wooden shoes whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) eye lighted on her (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>). For, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)
contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next; and he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) felt assured that if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should take it
into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brightly ornamented head to pretend that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) do a
murder and afterwards flay the victim, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out.

<p/>Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted
-LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was-RRB- to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the
afternoon, still with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of the King and Queen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You work hard, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said a man near her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>answered Madame Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``I have a good deal to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you make, madame?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Many things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For instance--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For instance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>returned Madame Defarge, composedly, <div class="bookquote">``shrouds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>The man moved a little further away, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue cap: feeling it mightily close
and oppressive. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed a King and Queen to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
fortunate in having his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King
and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the
shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) temporary
intoxication, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,
Long live everybody and everything! as if he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had never heard of
ubiquitous Jacques in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,
terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye,
more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) absolutely wept
with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three
hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,
and throughout Defarge held him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) by the collar, as if to restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
from flying at the objects of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) brief devotion and tearing them to
pieces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) on the back when it was over, like a
patron; <div class="bookquote">``you are a good boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a patron</b></font>)</div><p/>The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of
having made a mistake in his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) late demonstrations; but no.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the fellow we want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, in his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) ear; <div class="bookquote">``you make
these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more
insolent, and it is the nearer ended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the mender of roads, reflectively; <div class="bookquote">``that's true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would
stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than
in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath
tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot
deceive them too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
confirmation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you would shout and shed tears for anything, if
it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to
pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would
pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly yes, madame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true, madame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, with
a wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;
<div class="bookquote">``now, go home!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>XVI. Still Knitting


<p/>Madame Defarge and monsieur her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) husband returned amicably to the
bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) grave, listened to
the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,
for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village
scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the
village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that
when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to
faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled
up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel
look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the
stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder
was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which
everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all
started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares
who could find a living there.

<p/>Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the
stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres
of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the
night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole
world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling
star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in
the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every
vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.

<p/>The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,
in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their
journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier
guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two
of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was intimate
with, and affectionately embraced.

<p/>When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) dusky wings,
and they, having finally alighted near the Saint's boundaries, were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>)
streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) husband:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very little to-night, but all he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) knows. There is another spy
commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>)
can say, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) knows of one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyebrows with a cool
business air. <div class="bookquote">``It is necessary to register him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>). How do they call that
man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is English.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) had
been so careful to get it accurately, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) then spelt it with perfect
correctness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated madame. <div class="bookquote">``Good. Christian name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.
<div class="bookquote">``Good. His (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) appearance; is it known?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;
complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face
thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,
sinister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh my faith. It is a portrait!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) shall be
registered to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed -LRB-for it was midnight-RRB-,
and where Madame Defarge immediately took her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) post at her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) desk, counted
the small moneys that had been taken during her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) absence, examined the
stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of
her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally
dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to bed. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) turned out the contents of the bowl
of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
night. All this while, Defarge, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth, walked
up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which
condition, indeed, as to the business and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) domestic affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
walked up and down through life.

<p/>The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a
neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was
by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
whiffed the compound of scents away, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smoked-out pipe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are fatigued,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said madame, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glance as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knotted the
money. <div class="bookquote">``There are only the usual odours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a little tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) husband acknowledged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a little depressed, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said madame, whose quick eyes had
never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh, the men, the men!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>began Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated madame, nodding firmly; <div class="bookquote">``but my dear! You are
faint of heart to-night, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
breast, <div class="bookquote">``it _is_ a long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife; <div class="bookquote">``and when is it not a long time?
Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said
Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>demanded madame, composedly, <div class="bookquote">``does it take to make and store
the lightning? Tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Defarge raised his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that
too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not take a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame, <div class="bookquote">``for an earthquake to
swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the
earthquake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A long time, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything
before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not
seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame, extending her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) right hand, for emphasis,
<div class="bookquote">``that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and
coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it
is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world
that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider
the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with
more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My brave wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>returned Defarge, standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) head
a little bent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) hands clasped at his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) back, like a docile and
attentive pupil before his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) catechist, <div class="bookquote">``I do not question all this. But
it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,
it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>catechist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh well! How then?''  (<font color='red'><b>another enemy</b></font>)</div>demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there
were another enemy strangled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.
<div class="bookquote">``We shall not see the triumph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have helped it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned madame, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) extended hand in
strong action. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all
my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew
certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I
would--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then madame, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) felt charged with
cowardice; <div class="bookquote">``I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.
When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the
time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
little counter with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chain of money as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knocked its brains
out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arm in a serene
manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.

<p/>Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual place in the
wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not
drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,
and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell
dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner -LRB-as if they
themselves were elephants, or something as far removed-RRB-, until they met
the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they
thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.

<p/>A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
felt to be a new one. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knitting, and began to pin her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) head-dress, before she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) looked at the figure.

<p/>It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the
customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the
wine-shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>the new-comer</b></font>)</div>said the new-comer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day, monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said it aloud, but added to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knitting:
<div class="bookquote">``Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black
hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,
thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister
expression! Good day, one and all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a
mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame complied with a polite air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marvellous cognac this, madame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame
Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said,
however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knitting. The
visitor watched her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity
of observing the place in general.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You knit with great skill, madame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am accustomed to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty pattern too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_You_ think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said madame, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pastime,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said madame, still looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) with a smile while her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
fingers moved nimbly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for use?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
madame, drawing a breath and nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) head with a stern kind of
coquetry, <div class="bookquote">``I'll use it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be
decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two
men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of
looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.
Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there
one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) eyes open,
but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a
poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and
unimpeachable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_John_,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>thought madame, checking off her (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) work as her (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) fingers knitted,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) eyes looked at the stranger. <div class="bookquote">``Stay long enough, and I shall knit
`BARSAD' before you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a husband, madame?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Children?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Business seems bad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Business is very bad; the people are so poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As _you_ say,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>madame retorted, correcting him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), and deftly knitting an
extra something into his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) name that boded him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) no good.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.
Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ think?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned madame, in a high voice. <div class="bookquote">``I and my husband have
enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we
think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and
it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without
embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The spy</b></font>)</div><p/>The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) could find or make, did
not allow his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) baffled state to express itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) sinister face; but,
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) elbow on Madame
Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) cognac.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! the poor
Gaspard!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With a sigh of great compassion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My faith!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned madame, coolly and lightly, <div class="bookquote">``if people use knives
for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) knew beforehand what the
price of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) luxury was; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) has paid the price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) soft voice to a tone
that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary
susceptibility in every muscle of his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) wicked face: <div class="bookquote">``I believe there
is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor
fellow? Between ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>madame</b></font>)</div>asked madame, vacantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--Here is my husband!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge.

<p/>As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) by touching his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, <div class="bookquote">``Good day,
Jacques!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Defarge stopped short, and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day, Jacques!''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>the spy repeated; with not quite so much
confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You deceive yourself, monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>returned the keeper of the wine-shop.
<div class="bookquote">``You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy day</b></font>)</div>said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: <div class="bookquote">``good
day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spy day</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>answered Defarge, drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when
you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy
and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one has told me so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Having said it, he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) passed behind the little counter, and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
hand on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the
person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would
have shot with the greatest satisfaction.

<p/>The spy, well used to his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) business, did not change his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) unconscious
attitude, but drained his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh
water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it
out for him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>), took to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitting again, and hummed a little song over
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>observed Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>muttered Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>pursued the spy, <div class="bookquote">``that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, with much indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) old domestic,
had the charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), I know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was delivered to you. You see I am
informed of the circumstances?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such is the fact, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge. He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) had had it conveyed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>), in an accidental touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) wife's elbow as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitted and
warbled, that he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) would do best to answer, but always with brevity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, <div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter came; and it was
from your care that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter took him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), accompanied by a neat brown
monsieur; how is he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of
Tellson and Company--over to England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such is the fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>fact Defarge</b></font>)</div>repeated Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very interesting remembrances!''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy. <div class="bookquote">``I have known Doctor
Manette and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter, in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't hear much about them now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In effect,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>madame struck in, looking up from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) work and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little
song, <div class="bookquote">``we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe
arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,
they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held
no correspondence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly so, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>replied the spy. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) is going to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>echoed madame. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was pretty enough to have been married long
ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! You know I am English.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I perceive your tongue is,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>returned madame; <div class="bookquote">``and what the tongue is, I
suppose the man is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) did not take the identification as a compliment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) made the best
of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) cognac to the
end, he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to
one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard -LRB-ah,
poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!-RRB-, it is a curious thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) is
going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present
Marquis. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) lives unknown in England, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is no Marquis there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is
Mr. Charles Darnay. D’Aulnais is the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) mother's family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. Do what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would, behind the little counter,
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pipe, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
troubled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no
spy if he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) had failed to see it, or to record it in his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) mind.

<p/>Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be
worth, and no customers coming in to help him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) to any other, Mr. Barsad
paid for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had drunk, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) leave: taking occasion to say,
in a genteel manner, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) departed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the
husband and wife remained exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) had left them, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) should
come back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) wife
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) stood smoking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) hand on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chair: <div class="bookquote">``what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) has
said of Ma’amselle Manette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) has said it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned madame, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyebrows a little, <div class="bookquote">``it
is probably false. But it may be true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is--''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Defarge began, and stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)
sake, Destiny will keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) husband out of France.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) husband's destiny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) usual composure,
<div class="bookquote">``will take him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is to go, and will lead him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to the end that is
to end him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). That is all I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange'' (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>--said
Defarge, rather pleading with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) wife to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to admit it,
<div class="bookquote">``that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father, and herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)
husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by
the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered
madame. <div class="bookquote">``I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here
for their merits; that is enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rolled up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitting when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had said those words, and presently
took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head.
Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its
disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very
shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.

<p/>In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned
himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came
to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame
Defarge with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) work in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women
knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the
jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,
the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.

<p/>But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame
Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer
among every little knot of women that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had spoken with, and left
behind.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) husband smoked at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) door, looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) with admiration. <div class="bookquote">``A
great woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully
grand woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and
the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as
the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another
darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing
pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into
thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a
wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty,
Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat
knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around
a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,
counting dropping heads.




<p/>XVII. One Night


<p/>Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter sat
under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder
radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.

<p/>Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had reserved this last evening
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are happy, my dear father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite, my child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it
was yet light enough to work and read, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had neither engaged herself
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) usual work, nor had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) read to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had employed herself in
both ways, at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this
time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the
love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love
for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by
the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Even as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) could not command her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) voice.

<p/>In the sad moonlight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by the neck, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) face
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of
the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and
its going.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,
quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will
ever interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your
own heart, do you feel quite certain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could
scarcely have assumed, <div class="bookquote">``Quite sure, my darling! More than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
added, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tenderly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``my future is far brighter, Lucie,
seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever
was--without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could hope _that_, my father!--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain
it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot
fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be
wasted--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand towards his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lips, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took it in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and repeated
the word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the
natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,
how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) unconscious admission that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) would have been unhappy
without Charles, having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); and replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My child, you did see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and it is Charles. If it had not been
Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I
should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the first time, except at the trial, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) ever hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
refer to the period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) suffering. It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) a strange and new
sensation while his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) words were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) ears; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) remembered it long
afterwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand towards the moon.
<div class="bookquote">``I have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) from my prison-window, when I could not bear her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
light. I have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) when it has been such torture to me to think
of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against
my prison-walls. I have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), in a state so dull and lethargic,
that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I
could draw across her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines
with which I could intersect them.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) added in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) inward and pondering
manner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) looked at the moon, <div class="bookquote">``It was twenty either way, I remember,
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The strange thrill with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) go back to that time,
deepened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) in
the manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) reference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) only seemed to contrast his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had
been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether it
was a son who would some day avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father. -LRB-There was a time in my
imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.-RRB- Whether it
was a son who would never know his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's story; who might even live
to weigh the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's having disappeared of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own
will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) drew closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cheek and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of
me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have
cast up the years of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) age, year after year. I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) married
to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a
blank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have
brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and
the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) knew nothing of you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) cared nothing for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations could--I have imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) as coming to me in my cell, and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.
But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of
sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another
and more real child. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) outward appearance I know no more than
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) mother. The other had that likeness too--as you
have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?
I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
perplexed distinctions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) collected and calm manner could not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) blood from running
cold, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) thus tried to anatomise his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) old condition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), in the moonlight,
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) married
life was full of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) loving remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) lost father. My picture
was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) room, and I was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) prayers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) life was active,
cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love
that was I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) showed me her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) children,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor of Beauvais, <div class="bookquote">``and
they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed
a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked
up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) could never deliver me; I
imagined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) always brought me back after showing me such things.
But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and
blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beauvais</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless
me as fervently to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night
for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great
happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the
happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), solemnly commended her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) to Heaven, and humbly thanked
Heaven for having bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) on him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). By-and-bye, they went into the
house.

<p/>There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.

<p/>Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only
three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) regretted that Charles
was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) away; and drank to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) affectionately.

<p/>So, the time came for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.
But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came
downstairs again, and stole into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) room; not free from unshaped fears,
beforehand.

<p/>All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lay
asleep, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) needless candle in the
shadow at a distance, crept up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bed, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) lips to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>);
then, leaned over him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>Into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) held the
mastery of them even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,
resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be
beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) timidly laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) dear breast, and put up a prayer that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) might ever be as true to him (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) love aspired to be, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>)
sorrows deserved. Then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand, and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) lips once
more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves
of the plane-tree moved upon his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) face, as softly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) lips had moved
in praying for him (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>).




<p/>XVIII. Nine Days


<p/>The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
closed door of the Doctor's room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was speaking with Charles
Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.
Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of
reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,
but for the yet lingering consideration that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) brother Solomon should
have been the bridegroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,
and who had been moving round her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) to take in every point of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) quiet,
pretty dress; <div class="bookquote">``and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought
you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought
what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring
on my friend Mr. Charles!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bride</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't mean it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and
therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really? Well; but don't cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said the gentle Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not crying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross; <div class="bookquote">``_you_ are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I, my Pross?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>-LRB-By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>),
on occasion.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such
a present of plate as you have made `em, is enough to bring tears into
anybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till
I couldn't see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am highly gratified,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``though, upon my honour, I
had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there
might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>From Miss Pross.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asked the
gentleman of that name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>rejoined Miss Pross; <div class="bookquote">``you were a bachelor in your cradle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) little wig, <div class="bookquote">``that
seems probable, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you were cut out for a bachelor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>pursued Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``before you
were put in your cradle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``that I was very unhandsomely dealt
with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm soothingly round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) waist, <div class="bookquote">``I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and
I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave
your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your
own; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next
fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's
shall go to the wall -LRB-comparatively speaking-RRB- before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). And when, at
the fortnight's end, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes to join you and your beloved husband, on
your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear
Somebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an
old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)
own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) held the fair face from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to look at the
well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright
golden hair against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.

<p/>The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) came out with Charles
Darnay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they
went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face.
But, in the composure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was unaltered, except that to the
shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), like a cold
wind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) daughter, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) down-stairs to the chariot
which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in
another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange
eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.

<p/>Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to
breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the
door at parting.

<p/>It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) father
cheered her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
enfolding arms, <div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Charles! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was
gone.

<p/>The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the
preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,
and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great
change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted
there, had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) a poisoned blow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been
expected in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was
the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) absent
manner of clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head and drearily wandering away into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own
room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the
wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, <div class="bookquote">``I
think we had best not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) just now, or at all disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back
presently. Then, we will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a ride into the country, and dine
there, and all will be well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of
Tellson's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was detained two hours. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) came back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) ascended the
old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus
into the Doctor's rooms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was stopped by a low sound of knocking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, with a start. <div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">``O me, O me! All is
lost!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``What is to be told to Ladybird?
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) doesn't know me, and is making shoes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could to calm her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and went himself into the
Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had seen the shoemaker at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) work before, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head was bent
down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was very busy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) work again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) coat and waistcoat; his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) shirt was open at the
throat, as it used to be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) did that work; and even the old
haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) worked
hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.

<p/>Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, and observed that it was a
shoe of the old size and shape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took up another that was lying by
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and asked what it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A young lady's walking shoe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) muttered, without looking up. <div class="bookquote">``It
ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper
occupation. Think, dear friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing would induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to speak more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked up, for an instant at
a time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract
a word from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and
words fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on
the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind.

<p/>Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above
all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;
the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). In
conjunction with Miss Pross, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a
few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) having been
called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) own hand, represented to have been
addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) by the same post.

<p/>These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in
the hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) kept
another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
thought the best, on the Doctor's case.

<p/>In the hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) recovery, and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the
first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) life, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) post by the window in the same
room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), since, on being pressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) became worried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) abandoned that
attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), as a silent protest against the delusion into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had
fallen, or was falling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) remained, therefore, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) seat near the
window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could think of, that it was a free place.

<p/>Doctor Manette took what was given him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to eat and drink, and worked on,
that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour
after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) life, to read or write.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose
and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you go out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked down at the floor on either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in the old manner,
looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.
Lorry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) saw, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) leaned forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bench in the dusk,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knees and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was in
some misty way asking himself, <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.

<p/>Miss Pross and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) divided the night into two watches, and observed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
at intervals from the adjoining room. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paced up and down for a long
time before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay down; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did finally lay himself down, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fell asleep. In the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was up betimes, and went straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
bench and to work.

<p/>On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) cheerfully by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) name,
and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
returned no reply, but it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heard what was said, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry
to have Miss Pross in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) work, several times during the day;
at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father then
present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing
amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long
enough, or often enough to harass him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and it lightened Mr. Lorry's
friendly heart to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked up oftener, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/>When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) as before:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Doctor, will you go out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>As before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``Out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could extract no answer
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the
meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had
sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
slipped away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bench.

<p/>The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.
The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,
seven days, eight days, nine days.

<p/>With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and
heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was
well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,
was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) had never been so intent on
his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) work, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in
the dusk of the ninth evening.




<p/>XIX. An Opinion


<p/>Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) post. On the
tenth morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) suspense, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) when it was dark
night.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes and roused himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) doubted, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had
done so, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the
Doctor's room and looking in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) perceived that the shoemaker's bench
and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading
at the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) usual morning dress, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face -LRB-which
Mr. Lorry could distinctly see-RRB-, though still very pale, was calmly
studious and attentive.

<p/>Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had satisfied himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was awake, Mr. Lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own; for, did not his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes show him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
friend before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed
as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had so strong an impression had actually happened?

<p/>It was but the inquiry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) first confusion and astonishment, the
answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), Jarvis Lorry, there?
How came he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to have fallen asleep, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) clothes, on the sofa in Doctor
Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?

<p/>Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) side. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
had had any particle of doubt left, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) talk would of necessity have
resolved it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was by that time clear-headed, and had none.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) appeared to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) customary state of mind, Mr.
Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) anxiety, so anxious to obtain.

<p/>Miss Pross, submitting herself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) judgment, the scheme was worked
out with care. Having abundance of time for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) usual methodical
toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) usual
white linen, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the
usual way, and came to breakfast.

<p/>So far as it was possible to comprehend him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe
advance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) at first supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daughter's marriage had taken
place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to
the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thinking and
counting, and evidently made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) uneasy. In all other respects, however,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sought. And that aid was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own.

<p/>Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) and the
Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a
very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is
very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less
so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, which were discoloured by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) late work, the
Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had already glanced
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hands more than once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor Manette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) affectionately on the
arm, <div class="bookquote">``the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray
give your mind to it, and advise me well for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sake--and above all,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter's--his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter's, my dear Manette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, <div class="bookquote">``some mental
shock--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be explicit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``Spare no detail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,
of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,
the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how
long, because I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) cannot calculate the time himself, and there
are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from
which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) cannot trace
himself--as I once heard him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) publicly relate in a striking manner. It is
the case of a shock from which he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) has recovered, so completely, as to
be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and
great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,
there has been,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) paused and took a deep breath--<div class="bookquote">``a slight relapse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, <div class="bookquote">``Of how long duration?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine days and nights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did it show itself? I infer,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hands again, <div class="bookquote">``in the
resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, did you ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the Doctor, distinctly and
collectedly, though in the same low voice, <div class="bookquote">``engaged in that pursuit
originally?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when the relapse fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in most respects--or in all
respects--as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think in all respects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter. Does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter know of the relapse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. It has been kept from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and I hope will always be kept from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, and murmured, <div class="bookquote">``That was very kind. That was
very thoughtful!''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand in return, and neither of
the two spoke for a little while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear Manette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) most
considerate and most affectionate way, ``I am a mere man of business,
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not
possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of
intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom
I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this
relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it
be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come
about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been
more desirous in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,
if I knew how.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,
knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be
able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
and teach me how to be a little more useful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and
Mr. Lorry did not press him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it probable,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,
<div class="bookquote">``that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
unforeseen by its subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it dreaded by him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said it with an involuntary shudder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's
mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``be sensibly relieved if he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on
him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even
believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand on the Doctor's arm again,
after a short silence on both sides, <div class="bookquote">``to what would you refer this
attack?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor Manette</b></font>)</div>returned Doctor Manette, <div class="bookquote">``that there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind, that those associations
would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a
particular occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) less able to bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor Manette</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) remember what took place in the relapse?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Lorry,
with natural hesitation.

<p/>The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head, and
answered, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, as to the future,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>hinted Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the future,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, recovering firmness, <div class="bookquote">``I should have
great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so soon, I
should have great hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), yielding under the pressure of a complicated
something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,
and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that
the worst was over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well! That's good comfort. I am thankful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thankful!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>repeated the Doctor, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head with reverence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two other points,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``on which I am anxious to
be instructed. I may go on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot do your friend a better service.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>The Doctor gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the first, then. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) do too much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not. It may be the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind, to be always in
singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in
part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy
things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) may have observed himself, and made the discovery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is not under too great a strain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I am quite sure of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Manette, if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) were overworked now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a
violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think so. I do not think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div>said Doctor Manette with the
firmness of self-conviction, <div class="bookquote">``that anything but the one train of
association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has
happened, and after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost
believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assurance out of personal
endurance and distress. It was not for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend to abate that
confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
really was, and approached his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) second and last point. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt it to
be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old Sunday morning
conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen in the
last nine days, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must face it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) throat, <div class="bookquote">``we
will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. We will say, to put a
case and for the sake of illustration, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) had been used, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) bad
time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) was unexpectedly
found at his (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) forge again. Is it not a pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) should keep it by
him (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, and beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) foot
nervously on the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) has always kept it by him (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``Now, would it not be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) should let it go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) foot nervously on the
ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not find it easy to advise me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``I quite
understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head, and stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div>said Doctor Manette, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) after an uneasy pause,
<div class="bookquote">``it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings
of this poor man's mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became more
practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental
torture; that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reach. Even now, when I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is more hopeful of
himself than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence, the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might need that old employment, and not
find it, gives him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) looked like his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) illustration, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes to Mr. Lorry's
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and
bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go
with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the
forge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, tremulously, <div class="bookquote">``it is such an old
companion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not keep it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) gained
in firmness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) saw the Doctor disquieted. <div class="bookquote">``I would recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to
sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.
Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter's
sake, my dear Manette!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take
it away while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was present. Let it be removed when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not there;
let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) miss his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old companion after an absence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They
passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the
three following days he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth
day he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) went away to join Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband. The precaution that
had been taken to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) silence, Mr. Lorry had previously
explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had no suspicions.

<p/>On the night of the day on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) left the house, Mr. Lorry went into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross
carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and
guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while
Miss Pross held the candle as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) were assisting at a murder--for
which, indeed, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) grimness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was no unsuitable figure. The
burning of the body -LRB-previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose-RRB- was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,
shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible
crime.




<p/>XX. A Plea


<p/>When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home
many hours, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) presented himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was not improved in habits, or
in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of
speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) when no one overheard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Darnay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Carton, <div class="bookquote">``I wish we might be friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are already friends, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't
mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be
friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), in all good-humour and
good-fellowship, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) did mean?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Carton, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I find that easier to comprehend
in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You
remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than
usual?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
you had been drinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I
always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day,
when all days are at an end for me! Don't be alarmed; I am not going to
preach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming
to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Carton, with a careless wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) hand, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) waved that
away. <div class="bookquote">``On the drunken occasion in question -LRB-one of a large number, as
you know-RRB-, I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I
wish you would forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot it long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to
me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,
and a light answer does not help me to forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it was a light answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>returned Darnay, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your forgiveness
for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my
surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the
faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good
Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to
remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the great service,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Carton, <div class="bookquote">``I am bound to avow to you, when
you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I
don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! I
say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You make light of the obligation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>returned Darnay, <div class="bookquote">``but I will not
quarrel with _your_ light answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose;
I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am
incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it,
ask Stryver, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)'ll tell you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done
any good, and never will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I don't know that you `never will.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure
to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent
reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be
permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might
be regarded as an useless -LRB-and I would add, if it were not for the
resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental-RRB- piece of
furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I
doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I
should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I
dare say, to know that I had it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you try?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have
indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so, Carton, by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute
afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss
Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), in short, not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), but as anybody might who saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) showed himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) fair young
wife; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) afterwards joined her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in their own rooms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) found
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are thoughtful to-night!''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) arm about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dearest Charles,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) breast, and the inquiring
and attentive expression fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``we are rather thoughtful
to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, my Lucie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to
ask it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>What, indeed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hand putting aside the golden hair from the
cheek, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) other hand against the heart that beat for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my own? Why so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) always, and very
lenient on his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) faults when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) is not by. I would ask you to believe that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) has a heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a painful reflection to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles Darnay, quite
astounded, <div class="bookquote">``that I should have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) any wrong. I never thought this
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband, it is so. I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) is not to be reclaimed; there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) character or fortunes is reparable
now. But, I am sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) is capable of good things, gentle things,
even magnanimous things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked so beautiful in the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) faith in this lost man,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband could have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was for hours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, O my dearest Love!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) urged, clinging nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), laying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breast, and raising her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``remember how strong
we are in our happiness, and how weak he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) misery!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The supplication touched him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) home. <div class="bookquote">``I will always remember it, dear
Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and folded
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets,
could have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops
of pity kissed away by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of
that husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might have cried to the night--and the words would not
have parted from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips for the first time--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) sweet compassion!''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>XXI. Echoing Footsteps


<p/>A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where
the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, and herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) old directress and
companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in
the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of
years.

<p/>At first, there were times, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was a perfectly happy young wife,
when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) work would slowly fall from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes would be
dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,
afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart too much.
Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>):
doubts, of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of
footsteps at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would
be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so much, swelled to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
eyes, and broke like waves.

<p/>That time passed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little Lucie lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) bosom. Then, among the
advancing echoes, there was the tread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) tiny feet and the sound of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and
the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and the Divine friend of
children, to whom in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had confided hers, seemed to take
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arms, as He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took the child of old, and made it a sacred
joy to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,
weaving the service of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) happy influence through the tissue of all
their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband's
step was strong and prosperous among them; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father's firm and equal.
Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an
unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the
plane-tree in the garden!

<p/>Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not
harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own, lay in a halo on a
pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, with a radiant
smile, <div class="bookquote">``Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to
leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>those were not
tears all of agony that wetted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) young mother's cheek, as the spirit
departed from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and
forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words!

<p/>Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other
echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath
of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were
mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed
murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as
the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or
dressing a doll at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of
the Two Cities that were blended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) life.

<p/>The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some
half-dozen times a year, at most, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) claimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) privilege of coming in
uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had once
done often. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) never came there heated with wine. And one other thing
regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages.

<p/>No man ever really loved a woman, lost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a
blameless though an unchanged mind, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a wife and a mother,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children had a strange sympathy with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--an instinctive
delicacy of pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton
was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) chubby arms,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) place with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) grew. The little boy had spoken of
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), almost at the last. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Carton! Kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Stryver shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way through the law, like some great engine
forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) useful friend in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped
life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
it the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was to lead; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) no more thought of emerging from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>)
state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with
property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.

<p/>These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most
offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) like three
sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
Lucie's husband: delicately saying <div class="bookquote">``Halloa! here are three lumps of
bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie husband</b></font>)</div>The polite
rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.
Stryver with indignation, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) afterwards turned to account in the
training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the
pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was also in the habit of
declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) full-bodied wine, on the arts
Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to <div class="bookquote">``catch''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>), and on the
diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``not
to be caught.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally
parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) for the
latter by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had told it so often, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) believed
it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried
off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.

<p/>These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes
amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) little
daughter was six years old. How near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heart the echoes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
child's tread came, and those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) own dear father's, always active
and self-possessed, and those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) dear husband's, need not be told.
Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself
with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste, was music to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>). Nor, how there were echoes all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), sweet
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) ears, of the many times her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
more devoted to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) married -LRB-if that could be-RRB- than single, and of the
many times her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) help to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``What is
the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,
as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to
have too much to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly
in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about
little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,
as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.

<p/>On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.
Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were
all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the
lightning from the same place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I began to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) brown wig back, <div class="bookquote">``that
I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of
business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way
to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a
run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able
to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania
among some of them for sending it to England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That has a bad look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know what reason
there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson's are
getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course
without due occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay, <div class="bookquote">``you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade
himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sweet temper was soured, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) grumbled, <div class="bookquote">``but I
am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration. Where is
Manette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by
which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without
reason. You are not going out, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the
Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be
pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can't
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, it has been kept for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And sleeping soundly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right; all safe and well! I don't know why anything should be
otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out
all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now,
come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear
the echoes about which you have your theory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a theory; it was a fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fancy, then, my wise pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``They
are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's
life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the
footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in
the dark London window.

<p/>Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows
heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy
heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous
roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms
struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:
all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a
weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.

<p/>Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what
agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the
heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could
have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,
powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every
weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who
could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to
force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and
heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented
with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.

<p/>As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging
circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron
had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,
already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,
thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm
another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep near to me, Jacques Three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>cried Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``and do you, Jacques
One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these
patriots as you can. Where is my wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, well! Here you see me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame, composed as ever, but not
knitting to-day. Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,
in place of the usual softer implements, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) girdle were a pistol
and a cruel knife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you go, my wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I go,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame, <div class="bookquote">``with you at present. You shall see me at the head
of women, by-and-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. <div class="bookquote">``Patriots and
friends, we are ready! The Bastille!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped
into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on
depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums
beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack
began.

<p/>Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great
towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through
the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) up against
a cannon, and on the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) became a cannonier--Defarge of the
wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.

<p/>Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers,
cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! <div class="bookquote">``Work, comrades
all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques
Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all
the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>Thus Defarge of the
wine-shop, still at his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) gun, which had long grown hot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To me, women!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried madame his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``What! We can kill as well as
the men when the place is taken!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), with a shrill thirsty
cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and
revenge.

<p/>Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single
drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight
displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing
weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work
at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,
execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the
furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the
single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great
towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) gun, grown doubly hot
by the service of Four fierce hours.

<p/>A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly
perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly
the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the
wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer
walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!

<p/>So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) on, that even to
draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) breath or turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) head was as impracticable as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) had been
struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) was landed in the
outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>)
made a struggle to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>). Jacques Three was nearly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) side;
Madame Defarge, still heading some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) women, was visible in the
inner distance, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) knife was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) hand. Everywhere was tumult,
exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet
furious dumb-show.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Prisoners!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Records!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The secret cells!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The instruments of torture!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Prisoners!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, <div class="bookquote">``The Prisoners!''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>was
the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an
eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost
billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and
threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
undisclosed, Defarge laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) strong hand on the breast of one of
these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>)
hand--separated him (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) from the rest, and got him (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) between himself and the
wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show me the North Tower!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will faithfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, <div class="bookquote">``if you will come with me. But
there is no one there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>asked
Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The meaning, monsieur?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I
shall strike you dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kill him (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, it is a cell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Show it me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pass this way, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div><p/>Jacques Three, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) usual craving on him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>), and evidently disappointed
by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,
held by Defarge's arm as he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) held by the turnkey's. Their three heads had
been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much
as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the
noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and
its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around
outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,
occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the
air like spray.

<p/>Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry
waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,
linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and
there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;
but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a
tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls
and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible
to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had
come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.

<p/>The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung
the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed
in:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One hundred and five, North Tower!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The turnkey</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,
with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by
stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred
across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were
the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said
Defarge to the turnkey.

<p/>The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!--Look here, Jacques!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A. M.!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>croaked Jacques Three, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) read greedily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexandre Manette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge in his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) ear, following the letters
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. <div class="bookquote">``And here he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)
wrote `a poor physician.' And it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>), without doubt, who scratched
a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) had still the linstock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) own hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) made a sudden
exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and
table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold the light higher!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. <div class="bookquote">``Look
among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>throwing it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the
light higher, you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>With a menacing look at the turnkey he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) crawled upon the hearth, and,
peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,
and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar
and dust came dropping down, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) face to avoid; and
in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney
into which his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) groped with a
cautious touch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light
them, you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The turnkey</b></font>)</div><p/>The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping
again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and
retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense
of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once
more.

<p/>They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint
Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard
upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.
Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for
judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people's
blood -LRB-suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness-RRB- be
unavenged.

<p/>In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) grey coat and red
decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a
woman's. <div class="bookquote">``See, there is my husband!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, pointing him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) out.
<div class="bookquote">``See Defarge!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and
remained immovable close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>); remained immovable close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) through
the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) along; remained immovable
close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was got near his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) destination, and began to
be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) when the
long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) foot
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) neck, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) head.

<p/>The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) horrible idea
of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) could be and do. Saint
Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the
governor's body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge
where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. <div class="bookquote">``Lower
the lamp yonder!''  (<font color='red'><b>Saint</b></font>)</div>cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new
means of death; <div class="bookquote">``here is one of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) soldiers to be left on guard!''  (<font color='red'><b>Antoine</b></font>)</div>The
swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.

<p/>The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving
of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,
voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.

<p/>But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so
fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore
more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly
released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high
overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last
Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.
Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose
drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive
faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them;
faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped
lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, <div class="bookquote">``THOU DIDST
IT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>bear witness</b></font>)</div><p/>Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the
accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters
and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken
hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint
Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven
hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay,
and keep these feet far out of her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) life! For, they are headlong, mad,
and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask
at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once
stained red.




<p/>XXII. The Sea Still Rises


<p/>Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) could, with
the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame
Defarge sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.
Madame Defarge wore no rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) head, for the great brotherhood of
Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) streets had a
portentously elastic swing with them.

<p/>Madame Defarge, with her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,
contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several
knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense
of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on
the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: <div class="bookquote">``I know how
hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;
but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to
destroy life in you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Every lean bare arm, that had been without work
before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that
they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;
the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the
last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.

<p/>Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was
to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>hundreds</b></font>)
sisterhood knitted beside her (<font color='blue'><b>hundreds</b></font>). The short, rather plump wife of a starved
grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had
already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said The Vengeance. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, then! Who comes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Saint</b></font>)</div><p/>As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine
Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading
murmur came rushing along.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Defarge,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame. <div class="bookquote">``Silence, patriots!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) wore, and looked
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>)! <div class="bookquote">``Listen, everywhere!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame again. <div class="bookquote">``Listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open
mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had
sprung to their feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say then, my husband. What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``News from the other world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried madame, contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``The other world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people
that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from all throats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The news is of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is among us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Among us!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from the universal throat again. <div class="bookquote">``And dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not dead! He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feared us so much--and with reason--that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) caused himself
to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have
found him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in. I have
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) but now, on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had reason to fear us. Say all! _Had_ he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sinner</b></font>)</div><p/>Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) had
never known it yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) would have known it in his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) heart of hearts if he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)
could have heard the answering cry.

<p/>A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) wife looked
steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum
was heard as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) moved it at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feet behind the counter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Patriots!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, in a determined voice, <div class="bookquote">``are we ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) girdle; the drum was beating
in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and
The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms about
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to
house, rousing the women.

<p/>The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked
from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into
the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From
such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their
children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one
another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.
Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant
Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of
these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon
alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon
who told my old father that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might eat grass, when I had no bread
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these
breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our
suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my
knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers,
and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,
Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend
Foulon to pieces, and dig him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into the ground, that grass may grow from
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,
whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they
dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men
belonging to them from being trampled under foot.

<p/>Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at
the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out
of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with
such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not
a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the
wailing children.

<p/>No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where
this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent
open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,
and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) in the Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried madame, pointing with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knife. <div class="bookquote">``See the old villain bound
with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) back.
Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) eat it now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knife
under her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arm, and clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands as at a play.

<p/>The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to
others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the
clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,
and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent
expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at
a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some
wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture
to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a
telegraph between her (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) and the crowd outside the building.

<p/>At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head. The favour was
too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got
him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>)!

<p/>It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge
had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable
wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned
her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand in one of the ropes with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was tied--The Vengeance and
Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows
had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high
perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, <div class="bookquote">``Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)
out! Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) to the lamp!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) knees; now, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) feet; now, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) back; dragged, and struck at,
and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>)
face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always
entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of
action, with a small clear space about him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) as the people drew one
another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) go--as a cat
might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>)
while they made ready, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) besought her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>): the women passionately
screeching at him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) killed with grass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) mouth. Once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) shrieking; twice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and
held him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the
mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.

<p/>Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted
and danced his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when
the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the
people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard
five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) crimes
on flaring sheets of paper, seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>)--would have torn him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) out of the
breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) head and heart on
pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession
through the streets.

<p/>Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,
wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by
long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them
again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in
common, afterwards supping at their doors.

<p/>Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
hoped.

<p/>It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its last
knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his (<font color='blue'><b>customers</b></font>) wife, in
husky tones, while fastening the door:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last it is come, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh well!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned madame. <div class="bookquote">``Almost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Saint</b></font>)</div><p/>Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum's was the
only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The
Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) up and had
the same speech out of him (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint
Antoine's bosom.




<p/>XXIII. Fire Rises


<p/>There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where
the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>)
poor ignorant soul and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) poor reduced body together. The prison on the
crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,
but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of
them knew what his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not
be what he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was ordered.

<p/>Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as
shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,
dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated
animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn
out.

<p/>Monseigneur -LRB-often a most worthy individual gentleman-RRB- was a national
blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;
nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought
things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for
Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must
be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it
was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing
to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
unaccountable.

<p/>But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like
it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
it, and had seldom graced it with his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) presence except for the pleasures
of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting
the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces
of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in
the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the
disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
beautifying features of Monseigneur.

<p/>For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the
dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was and
to dust he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) must return, being for the most part too much occupied in
thinking how little he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had for supper and how much more he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) would eat if
he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had it--in these times, as he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) lonely labour,
and viewed the prospect, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) would see some rough figure approaching on
foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now
a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern
without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian
aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many
highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled
with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.

<p/>Such a man came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could get from a shower of hail.

<p/>The man looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill,
and at the prison on the crag. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had identified these objects
in what benighted mind he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a dialect that was just
intelligible:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How goes it, Jacques?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All well, Jacques.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Touch then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No dinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but supper now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the fashion,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>growled the man. <div class="bookquote">``I meet no dinner anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and
steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held
it from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and dropped something into it from between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger and
thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Touch then.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mender of roads.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, putting the pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. <div class="bookquote">``You go down
here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Devil with all that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interrupted the other, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) eye
over the landscape. <div class="bookquote">``_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.
Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
village.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. When do you cease to work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At sunset.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without
resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you
wake me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The wayfarer</b></font>)</div><p/>The wayfarer smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) pipe out, put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) breast, slipped off his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
great wooden shoes, and lay down on his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) back on the heap of stones. He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
was fast asleep directly.

<p/>As the road-mender plied his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling
away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man -LRB-who wore a red cap
now, in place of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue one-RRB- seemed fascinated by the figure on the
heap of stones. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were so often turned towards it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.
The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen
red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of
beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen
and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender
of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) feet were
footsore, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) ankles chafed and bleeding; his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) great shoes, stuffed
with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long
leagues, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) clothes were chafed into holes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) himself was into
sores. Stooping down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), the road-mender tried to get a peep at
secret weapons in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) breast or where not; but, in vain, for he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) slept
with his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) arms crossed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), and set as resolutely as his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) lips.
Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and
drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against
this figure. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) eyes from it to the horizon and
looked around, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) small fancy similar figures, stopped by no
obstacle, tending to centres all over France.

<p/>The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness, to sunshine on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face and shadow, to the paltering lumps
of dull ice on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,
the mender of roads having got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village, roused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sleeper</b></font>)</div>said the sleeper, rising on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow. <div class="bookquote">``Two leagues beyond the
summit of the hill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About. Good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,
squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and
appearing even to whisper to them in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispering to all the village.
When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,
as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A
curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered
together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of
looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,
chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) house-top
alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>)
chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to
the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need
to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.

<p/>The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its
solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened
the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace
flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a
swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through
the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the
stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis
had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four
lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all
was black again.

<p/>But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely
visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,
picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,
and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.
Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the
stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.

<p/>A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was
spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the
space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur
Gabelle's door. <div class="bookquote">``Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tocsin rang
impatiently, but other help -LRB-if that were any-RRB- there was none. The
mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood
with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the
sky. <div class="bookquote">``It must be forty feet high,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said they, grimly; and never moved.

<p/>The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on
the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;
removed from them, a group of soldiers. <div class="bookquote">``Help, gentlemen--officers! The
chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
timely aid! Help, help!''  (<font color='red'><b>The officers</b></font>)</div>The officers looked towards the soldiers who
looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting
of lips, <div class="bookquote">``It must burn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the soldiers</b></font>)</div><p/>As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the
village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and
fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in
every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to
authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,
and that post-horses would roast.

<p/>The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and
raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the
infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising
and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in
torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the
two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke
again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake
and contending with the fire.

<p/>The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,
scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce
figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten
lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran
dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the
heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and
splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied
birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures
trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded
roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next
destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,
abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.

<p/>Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment
of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter
days--became impatient for an interview with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabelle</b></font>), and, surrounding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabelle</b></font>)
house, summoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabelle</b></font>) to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,
Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabelle</b></font>) door, and retire to hold counsel
with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again
withdrew himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabelle</b></font>) housetop behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabelle</b></font>) stack of chimneys; this time
resolved, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabelle</b></font>) door were broken in -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabelle</b></font>) was a small Southern man
of retaliative temperament-RRB-, to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet, and crush a man or two below.

<p/>Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the
distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door,
combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having an
ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) posting-house gate,
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favour.
A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur
Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,
and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for that
while.

<p/>Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom
the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they
had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellows, upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up
in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,
North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,
no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate
successfully.




<p/>XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock


<p/>In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by
the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the
flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on
the shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays
of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful
tissue of the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) home.

<p/>Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of
a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted
in.

<p/>Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) not being appreciated: of his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) being so little wanted in France, as
to incur considerable danger of receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) dismissal from it, and
this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with
infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) could
ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years,
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no
sooner beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) terrors than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) noble heels.

<p/>The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the
mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good
eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride,
Sardanapalus's luxury, and a mole's blindness--but it had dropped
out and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its
outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was
all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and
<div class="bookquote">``suspended,''  (<font color='red'><b>Royalty</b></font>)</div>when the last tidings came over.

<p/>The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was
come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.

<p/>As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of
Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank. Spirits are supposed to
haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur
without a guinea haunted the spot where his (<font color='blue'><b>Bank</b></font>) guineas used to be.
Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most
to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson's was a munificent
house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming
storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made
provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there
by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer
from France reported himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>nobles</b></font>) tidings at Tellson's, almost as
a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that
time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this
was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in
consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news
out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran
through Temple Bar to read.

<p/>On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) desk, and Charles
Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in a low voice. The
penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now
the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an
hour or so of the time of closing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles
Darnay, rather hesitating, <div class="bookquote">``I must still suggest to you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand. That I am too old?''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a
disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Charles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, <div class="bookquote">``you touch
some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe
enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a
disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of
old, and is in Tellson's confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the
long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all
these years, who ought to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I were going myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly,
and like one thinking aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr.
Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You
are a wise counsellor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the
thought -LRB-which I did not mean to utter here, however-RRB- has passed through
my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for
the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) spoke
here in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) former thoughtful manner, <div class="bookquote">``that one might be listened to,
and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night,
after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you were talking to Lucie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. I wonder you
are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to
France at this time of day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``However, I am not going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles Darnay, with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``It is
more to the purpose that you say you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry
glanced at the distant House, and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``you can have no
conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and
of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The
Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they
might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set
afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these
with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise
getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power -LRB-without loss of
precious time-RRB- of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall
I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose
bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about
the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>House</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, glancing at
the House again, <div class="bookquote">``you are to remember, that getting things out of
Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an
impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought
to us here -LRB-I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to
whisper it, even to you-RRB-, by the strangest bearers you can imagine,
every one of whom had his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head hanging on by a single hair as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) passed
the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily
as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you really go to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of
delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you take no one with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing
to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my
bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>).
Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or
of having any design in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) head but to fly at anybody who touches his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)
master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and
youthfulness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little
commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and
live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with
Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too
much the way of Monseigneur under his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) reverses as a refugee, and it
was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this
terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under
the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or
omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched
millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that
should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,
years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such
vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the
restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,
and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured
without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was
such vapouring all about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, which had
already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) so.

<p/>Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
to Monseigneur, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), Darnay heard
with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between
going away that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.

<p/>The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had yet discovered any traces of the person to
whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own right
name. The address, turned into English, ran:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of
France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,
London, England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor Manette</b></font>)</div><p/>On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) one urgent and
express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should
be--unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate
between them. Nobody else knew it to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) name; his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own wife had no
suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; <div class="bookquote">``I have referred it,
I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this
gentleman is to be found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>House</b></font>)</div><p/>The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there
was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at
it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,
and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in
English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the
polished Marquis who was murdered,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one. <div class="bookquote">``Happy to say, I never
knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A craven who abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) post,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another--this Monseigneur had
been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of
hay--<div class="bookquote">``some years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Infected with the new doctrines,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a third, eyeing the direction
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) glass in passing; <div class="bookquote">``set himself in opposition to the last
Marquis, abandoned the estates when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) inherited them, and left them to
the ruffian herd. They will recompense him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) now, I hope, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) deserves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the blatant Stryver. <div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) though? Is that the sort of
fellow? Let us look at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) infamous name. D--n the fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on
the shoulder, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know the fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you, by Jupiter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mr. Darnay? D’ye hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) did? Don't ask, why, in these
times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do ask why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to
hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,
who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that
ever was known, abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) property to the vilest scum of the earth
that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a
man who instructs youth knows him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Well, but I'll answer you. I am sorry
because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's
why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and
said: <div class="bookquote">``You may not understand the gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bully
Stryver, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don't_
understand him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). You may tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) so, with my compliments. You may also
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), from me, that after abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) worldly goods and position
to this butcherly mob, I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is not at the head of them. But, no,
gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) fingers,
<div class="bookquote">``I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never
find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such
precious _protégés_. No, gentlemen; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll always show `em a clean pair
of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>With those words, and a final snap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) fingers, Mr. Stryver
shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk,
in the general departure from the Bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you take charge of the letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``You know where to
deliver it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been
addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and
that it has been here some time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From here, at eight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will come back, to see you off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,
Darnay made the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the
letter, and read it. These were its contents:


<p/>``Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.

<p/>``June 21, 1792. ``MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.

<p/>``After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the
village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and
brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a
great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the
ground.

<p/>``The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my
life -LRB-without your so generous help-RRB-, is, they tell me, treason against
the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an
emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not
against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that,
before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for
an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?

<p/>``Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that
emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)? I demand of Heaven, will he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your
ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!

<p/>``For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to
succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh
Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!

<p/>``From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and
nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the
assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.

<p/>``Your afflicted,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gabelle.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) family, stared him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) so
reproachfully in the face, that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) walked to and fro in the Temple
considering what to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) almost hid his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) face from the passersby.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew very well, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
resentful suspicions of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) uncle, and in the aversion with which his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was supposed to uphold,
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had acted imperfectly. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew very well, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) love for Lucie,
his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) renunciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) social place, though by no means new to his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own
mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had meant to
do it, and that it had never been done.

<p/>The happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own chosen English home, the necessity of being
always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week
following made all new again; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew very well, that to the force of
these circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had watched
the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled
until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from
France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of
confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out,
was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
France that might impeach him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) for it.

<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had oppressed no man, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had imprisoned no man; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) dues, that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had
relinquished them of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own will, thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it, won his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own private place there, and earned his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own
bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little
there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summer--and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had put the fact in plea and proof, for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
own safety, so that it could not but appear now.

<p/>This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) would go to Paris.

<p/>Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
to itself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) must go. Everything that arose before his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) mind drifted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
attraction. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
worked out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) who
could not fail to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was better than they, was not there,
trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
-LRB-injurious to himself-RRB- had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,
which had stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were
coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle's
letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
justice, honour, and good name.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) resolution was made. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must go to Paris.

<p/>Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must sail on, until he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
struck. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew of no rock; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) saw hardly any danger. The intention
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had done what he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had done, even although he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had left
it incomplete, presented it before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in France on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) presenting himself to assert
it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the
sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) walked to and fro with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) resolution made, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) considered that
neither Lucie nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father must know of it until he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was gone.
Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, always
reluctant to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old,
should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in
the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
situation was referable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of France in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not
discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence
in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) course.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arrived
in Paris he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would present himself to this old friend, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) must say
nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) intention now.

<p/>A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was
booted and equipped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have delivered that letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``I
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
perhaps you will take a verbal one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will, and readily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``if it is not dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) open pocket-book in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gabelle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Simply, `that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) has received the letter, and will come.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any time mentioned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) will start upon his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) journey to-morrow night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any person mentioned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,
and went out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the
misty air of Fleet-street. <div class="bookquote">``My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Lorry at parting, <div class="bookquote">``and take precious care of them till I come back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Charles Darnay shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage
rolled away.

<p/>That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat up late, and wrote
two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was under to go to Paris, and showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), at length, the reasons
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had, for feeling confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could become involved in no
personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and
their dear child to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) care, and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances. To both, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wrote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) would despatch letters
in proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) safety, immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) arrival.

<p/>It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind. It was a hard matter to
preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.
But, an affectionate glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wife, so happy and busy, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
resolute not to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) what impended -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had been half moved to do it,
so strange it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to act in anything without her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) quiet aid-RRB-, and
the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) would return by-and-bye
-LRB-an imaginary engagement took him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had secreted a valise
of clothes ready-RRB-, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
streets, with a heavier heart.

<p/>The unseen force was drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) fast to itself, now, and all the tides
and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before
midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) journey.
<div class="bookquote">``For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name!''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>was the poor prisoner's cry with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) strengthened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sinking heart, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) left all that was dear on earth behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and
floated away for the Loadstone Rock.


<p/>The end of the second book.





<p/>Book the Third--the Track of a Storm




<p/>I. In Secret


<p/>The traveller fared slowly on his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) way, who fared towards Paris from
England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad
horses, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) would have encountered to delay him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), though the fallen and
unfortunate King of France had been upon his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) throne in all his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) glory;
but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of
citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state
of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,
inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,
turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in
hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or
Death.

<p/>A very few French leagues of his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) journey were accomplished, when Charles
Darnay began to perceive that for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) along these country roads there
was no hope of return until he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) should have been declared a good citizen
at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) must on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) journey's end.
Not a mean village closed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) and England. The universal
watchfulness so encompassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been taken in a net,
or were being forwarded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) destination in a cage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could not have
felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) freedom more completely gone.

<p/>This universal watchfulness not only stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) on the highway twenty
times in a stage, but retarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) progress twenty times in a day, by
riding after him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) back, riding before him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) and stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
by anticipation, riding with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) and keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in charge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been
days upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) journey in France alone, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) went to bed tired out, in
a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.

<p/>Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
prison of the Abbaye would have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) on so far. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) difficulty at the
guard-house in this small place had been such, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) journey
to have come to a crisis. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was, therefore, as little surprised as
a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.

<p/>Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emigrant,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the functionary, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to send you on to Paris,
under an escort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could
dispense with the escort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) musket. <div class="bookquote">``Peace, aristocrat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as the good patriot says,''  (<font color='red'><b>the functionary</b></font>)</div>observed the timid functionary. <div class="bookquote">``You
are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no choice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles Darnay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Choice! Listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the same scowling red-cap. <div class="bookquote">``As if it was
not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is always as the good patriot says,''  (<font color='red'><b>the functionary</b></font>)</div>observed the functionary. <div class="bookquote">``Rise
and dress yourself, emigrant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by
a watch-fire. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) paid a heavy price for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) escort, and hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o’clock in the morning.

<p/>The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured
cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either
side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).

<p/>The escorted governed his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own horse, but a loose line was attached to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,
and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without
change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay
between them and the capital.

<p/>They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and
lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,
that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying
his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) to awaken any serious fears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) breast; for,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,
confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.

<p/>But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,
when the streets were filled with people--he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd
gathered to see him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called
out loudly, <div class="bookquote">``Down with the emigrant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) saddle, and,
resuming it as his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) safest place, said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own
will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a cursed emigrant,''  (<font color='red'><b>a farrier</b></font>)</div>cried a farrier, making at him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in a
furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; <div class="bookquote">``and you are a cursed
aristocrat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's
bridle -LRB-at which he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) was evidently making-RRB-, and soothingly said, <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>)
be; let him (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) be! He (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) will be judged at Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Judged!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farrier</b></font>)</div>repeated the farrier, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) hammer. <div class="bookquote">``Ay! and condemned
as a traitor.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>At this the crowd roared approval.

<p/>Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) horse's head to the
yard -LRB-the drunken patriot sat composedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) saddle looking on, with
the line round his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) wrist-RRB-, Darnay said, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could make his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
voice heard:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a
traitor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) lies!''  (<font color='red'><b>the smith</b></font>)</div>cried the smith. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) is a traitor since the decree. His (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) life
is forfeit to the people. His (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) cursed life is not his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) own!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which
another instant would have brought upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), the postmaster turned his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>)
horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) horse's flanks,
and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier
struck a blow upon them with his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no
more was done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this decree that the smith spoke of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>Darnay asked the
postmaster, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), and stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in the yard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When passed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the fourteenth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The day I left England!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be
others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and
condemning all to death who return. That is what he (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) meant when he (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) said
your life was not your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there are no such decrees yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>the postmaster</b></font>)</div>said the postmaster, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) shoulders; <div class="bookquote">``there
may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the postmaster</b></font>)</div><p/>They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and
lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and
would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn
up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in
Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and
wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by
the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their
way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.

<p/>Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are the papers of this prisoner?''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>demanded a resolute-looking man
in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.

<p/>Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was a free traveller and French citizen,
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had paid for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where,''  (<font color='red'><b>the personage</b></font>)</div>repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
whatever, <div class="bookquote">``are the papers of this prisoner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The drunken patriot had them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) cap, and produced them. Casting his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went
into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the
gate. Looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) while in this state of suspense, Charles
Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress
into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar
traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest
people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue
forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the
ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered
about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men
and women.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) saddle some half-hour, taking note of these
things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,
who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) delivered to the
escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
to dismount. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) did so, and the two patriots, leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) tired horse,
turned and rode away without entering the city.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) accompanied his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine
and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,
drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and
waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The
light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of
the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an
officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Citizen Defarge,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to Darnay's conductor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) took a slip of
paper to write on. <div class="bookquote">``Is this the emigrant Evremonde?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your age, Evremonde?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty-seven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married, Evremonde?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La
Force.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Darnay. <div class="bookquote">``Under what law, and for what offence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The officer</b></font>)</div><p/>The officer looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) slip of paper for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response
to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I
demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that
my right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the stolid reply. The officer
wrote until he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had finished, read over to himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had written,
sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words <div class="bookquote">``In secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must accompany
him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, <div class="bookquote">``who married the daughter of
Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>replied Darnay, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) with surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint
Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife came to your house to reclaim her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father? Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The word <div class="bookquote">``wife''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say
with sudden impatience, <div class="bookquote">``In the name of that sharp female newly-born,
and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the
truth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A bad truth for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and
looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so
sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a
little help?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None.''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you answer me a single question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free
communication with the world outside?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of
presenting my case?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried
in worse prisons, before now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But never by me, Citizen Defarge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Defarge glanced darkly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) for answer, and walked on in a steady
and set silence. The deeper he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) sank into this silence, the fainter hope
there was--or so Darnay thought--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) softening in any slight degree.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), therefore, made haste to say:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is of the utmost importance to me -LRB-you know, Citizen, even better
than I, of how much importance-RRB-, that I should be able to communicate to
Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,
the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the
prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>Defarge doggedly rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``nothing for you. My duty is to
my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.
I will do nothing for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) further, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) pride
was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets. The very children scarcely noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). A few passers turned
their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) as an aristocrat;
otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they
passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited
audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal
family. The few words that he (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) caught from this man's lips, first made
it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road -LRB-except at
Beauvais-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal
watchfulness had completely isolated him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).

<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) left England, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of course knew now. That
perils had thickened about him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fast, and might thicken faster and faster
yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of course knew now. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) could not but admit to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
might not have made this journey, if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) could have foreseen the events
of a few days. And yet his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by
the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future
was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant
hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few
rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knowledge as if it had
been a hundred thousand years away. The <div class="bookquote">``sharp female newly-born, and
called La Guillotine,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was hardly known to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), or to the generality
of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were
probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could
they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?

<p/>Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation
from his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife and child, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) foreshadowed the likelihood, or the
certainty; but, beyond this, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on
his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
arrived at the prison of La Force.

<p/>A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge
presented <div class="bookquote">``The Emigrant Evremonde.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What the Devil! How many more of them!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the man with the
bloated face.

<p/>Defarge took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two fellow-patriots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the Devil, I say again!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gaoler</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the gaoler, left with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<div class="bookquote">``How many more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gaoler</b></font>)</div><p/>The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely
replied, <div class="bookquote">``One must have patience, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>gaoler wife</b></font>)</div>Three turnkeys who entered
responsive to a bell she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, <div class="bookquote">``For
the love of Liberty;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
conclusion.

<p/>The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome
flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that
are ill cared for!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In secret, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gaoler</b></font>)</div>grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. <div class="bookquote">``As
if I was not already full to bursting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay
awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
subordinates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>said the chief, at length taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) keys, <div class="bookquote">``come with me,
emigrant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div><p/>Through the dismal prison twilight, his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) new charge accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) by
corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,
until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with
prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading
and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the
most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the
room.

<p/>In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning
unreality of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to
receive him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with
all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.

<p/>So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand
in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost
of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of
frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) eyes
that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.

<p/>It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) motionless. The gaoler standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) side, and the other
gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance
in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly
coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the
mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and
likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its
utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress
of disease that had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) to these gloomy shades!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, <div class="bookquote">``I have the
honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you
on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate
happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,
to ask your name and condition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in
words as suitable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could find.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
eyes, who moved across the room, <div class="bookquote">``that you are not in secret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chief gaoler</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say
so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several
members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted
but a short time.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I grieve to inform
the society--in secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room
to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), and many voices--among
which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) good wishes and encouragement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) turned at the grated door, to
render the thanks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and
the apparitions vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) sight forever.

<p/>The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had
ascended forty steps -LRB-the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them-RRB-, the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a
solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gaoler</b></font>)</div>said the gaoler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why am I confined alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do I know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can buy pen, ink, and paper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At
present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four
walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was
gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought in the same wandering way, <div class="bookquote">``Now am I left, as if I were
dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned from it
with a sick feeling, and thought, <div class="bookquote">``And here in these crawling creatures
is the first condition of the body after death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five
paces by four and a half.''  (<font color='red'><b>The prisoner</b></font>)</div>The prisoner walked to and fro in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) cell,
counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) made shoes, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) made
shoes, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) made shoes.''  (<font color='red'><b>The prisoner</b></font>)</div>The prisoner counted the measurement again, and
paced faster, to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) mind with him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) from that latter repetition.
<div class="bookquote">``The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among
them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the
embrasure of a window, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a light shining upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) golden
hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake,
through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
made shoes, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made shoes, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and
a half.''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting
and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it
still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
knew, in the swell that rose above them.




<p/>II. The Grindstone


<p/>Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was
in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from
the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to
a great nobleman who had lived in it until he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) made a flight from the
troubles, in his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) own cook's dress, and got across the borders. A
mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) was still in his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>)
metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation
of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men
besides the cook in question.

<p/>Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the
sin of having drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) high wages, by being more than ready and
willing to cut his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and
indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's
house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all
things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce
precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month
of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of
Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were
drinking brandy in its state apartments.

<p/>A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris,
would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.
For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have
said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid
over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson's had whitewashed the
Cupid, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest
linen, aiming -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) very often does-RRB- at money from morning to
night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in
Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and
also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest
provocation. Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things
exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had
taken fright at them, and drawn out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money.

<p/>What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would
lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in
Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons,
and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with
Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into
the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis
Lorry could, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought heavily of these questions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat by
a newly-lighted wood fire -LRB-the blighted and unfruitful year was
prematurely cold-RRB-, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) honest and courageous face there was a
deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the
room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) occupied rooms in the Bank, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) fidelity to the House of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they
derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about
that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,
was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages
of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two
great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the
open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared
to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,
or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless
objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) seat by the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had
opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had closed both again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shivered through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) frame.

<p/>From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came
the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring
in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
nature were going up to Heaven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``that no one near and
dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) have mercy on all
who are in danger!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought,
<div class="bookquote">``They have come back!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and sat listening. But, there was no loud
irruption into the courtyard, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had expected, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heard the gate
clash again, and all was quiet.

<p/>The nervousness and dread that were upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally
awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) got up to
go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) door suddenly
opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) fell back in
amazement.

<p/>Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father! Lucie with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arms stretched out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and with
that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. <div class="bookquote">``What is the
matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?
What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>With the look fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) paleness and wildness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) panted
out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms, imploringly, <div class="bookquote">``O my dear friend! My husband!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your husband, Lucie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What of Charles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, in Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't
collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) here unknown to
us; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the
bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices
came pouring into the courtyard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that noise?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, turning towards the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``Don't look out! Manette, for your life,
don't touch the blind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor turned, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand upon the fastening of the window, and
said, with a cool, bold smile:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been
a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In
France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would
touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I
knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I
told Lucie so.--What is that noise?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand was again upon the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. <div class="bookquote">``No, Lucie, my
dear, nor you!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't be so
terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) being in
this fatal place. What prison is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La Force!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in
your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to
do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or
I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;
you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you
to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must
instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a
room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not
delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do
nothing else than this. I know you are true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room, and turned the
key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and
partly opened the blind, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand upon the Doctor's arm, and
looked out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) into the courtyard.

<p/>Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near
enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The
people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they
had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up
there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.

<p/>But, such awful workers, and such awful work!

<p/>The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two
men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of
the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than
the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.
False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their
hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with
howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung
forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women
held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping
blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks
struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the
sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all
over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain
upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace
and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through
and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be
sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to
the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments
of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And
as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in
their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.

<p/>All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of
any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it
were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for
explanation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) friend's ashy face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at
the locked room, <div class="bookquote">``murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you
say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you
have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It
may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Doctor Manette pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,
and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) streaming white hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) remarkable face, and the impetuous
confidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) manner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put the weapons aside like water,
carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and
the unintelligible sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>),
surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all
linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with
cries of--<div class="bookquote">``Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner's
kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save
the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>and a thousand answering shouts.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window
and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father was
assisted by the people, and gone in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child and Miss Pross with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>); but, it never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew.

<p/>Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feet,
clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own
bed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) pretty
charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O
the long, long night, with no return of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father and no tidings!

<p/>Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the
irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>cried Lucie, affrighted. <div class="bookquote">``Hush! The soldiers' swords are
sharpened there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``The place is national property now,
and used as a kind of armoury, my love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) softly detached himself
from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so
besmeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by
the side of the grindstone, and looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) with a vacant air.
Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) rest on its
dainty cushions.

<p/>The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,
and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood
alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had
never given, and would never take away.




<p/>III. The Shadow


<p/>One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.
Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had no right to
imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the Bank roof. His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own possessions, safety, life, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would have hazarded
for Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust
he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) held was not his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own, and as to that business charge he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was a strict
man of business.

<p/>At first, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) mind reverted to Defarge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) thought of finding out
the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the
same consideration that suggested him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), repudiated him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) lived in the
most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in
its dangerous workings.

<p/>Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay
tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) said
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that
Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to
this, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) were to be released, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up
in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.

<p/>To this lodging he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) at once removed Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child, and Miss Pross:
giving them what comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could, and much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had himself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own occupations.
A disturbed and doleful mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) brought to bear upon them, and slowly
and heavily the day lagged on with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/>It wore itself out, and wore him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) out with it, until the Bank closed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
was again alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) room of the previous night, considering what to
do next, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a
man stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your servant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
to fifty years of age. For answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) repeated, without any change of
emphasis, the words:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen you somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps at my wine-shop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: <div class="bookquote">``You come from Doctor
Manette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what says he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)? What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) send me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Defarge gave into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the
words in the Doctor's writing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.
I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
from Charles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife. Let the bearer see his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>It was dated from La Force, within an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you accompany me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading
this note aloud, <div class="bookquote">``to where his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife resides?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>returned Defarge.

<p/>Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hat and they went down into the
courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame Defarge, surely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, who had left her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) in exactly
the same attitude some seventeen years ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>observed her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Madame go with us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) moved as
they moved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. That she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.
It is for their safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being
The Vengeance.

<p/>They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,
ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,
and found Lucie weeping, alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was thrown into a transport by the
tidings Mr. Lorry gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband, and clasped the hand that
delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) note--little thinking what it had been doing near him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in
the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DEAREST,--Take courage. I am well, and your father has
influence around me. You cannot answer this.
Kiss our child for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) who received
it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) turned from Defarge to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wife, and kissed one of the
hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took
to its knitting again.

<p/>There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) stopped in
the act of putting the note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) bosom, and, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hands yet at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted
eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; <div class="bookquote">``there are frequent
risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever
trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has the power
to protect at such times, to the end that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may know them--that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
may identify them. I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) more and more, <div class="bookquote">``I state the case, Citizen Defarge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Defarge looked gloomily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wife, and gave no other answer than a
gruff sound of acquiescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better, Lucie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, doing all he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could to
propitiate, by tone and manner, <div class="bookquote">``have the dear child here, and our
good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no
French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was more than a
match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,
appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,
whom her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes first encountered, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope
_you_ are pretty well!''  (<font color='red'><b>any foreigner</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) also bestowed a British cough on Madame
Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) child?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, stopping in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) work for the
first time, and pointing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it
were the finger of Fate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Lorry; <div class="bookquote">``this is our poor prisoner's darling
daughter, and only child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) party seemed to fall so
threatening and dark on the child, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother instinctively
kneeled on the ground beside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and held her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) breast. The
shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) party seemed then to fall,
threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is enough, my husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen them. We
may go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div><p/>But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and
presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no harm. You will
help me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) if you can?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your husband is not my business here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>returned Madame Defarge, looking
down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) with perfect composure. <div class="bookquote">``It is the daughter of your father
who is my business here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
will put her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more
afraid of you than of these others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband.
Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thumb-nail and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>),
collected his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face into a sterner expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it that your husband says in that little letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>asked Madame
Defarge, with a lowering smile. <div class="bookquote">``Influence; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) says something touching
influence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
breast, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) alarmed eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) questioner and not on it, <div class="bookquote">``has
much influence around him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>questioner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely it will release him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Let it do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a wife and mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>cried Lucie, most earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``I implore you to
have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against
my innocent husband, but to use it in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) behalf. O sister-woman, think
of me. As a wife and mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) friend The Vengeance:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little
as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have
known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,
often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in
themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,
sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend Vengeance</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have seen nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned The Vengeance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have borne this a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) eyes
again upon Lucie. <div class="bookquote">``Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife
and mother would be much to us now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge
went last, and closed the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage, my dear Lucie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Courage,
courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of
late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
shadow on me and on all my hopes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry; <div class="bookquote">``what is this despondency in the brave
little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,
for all that, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) secret mind it troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) greatly.




<p/>IV. Calm in Storm


<p/>Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), that
not until long afterwards, when France and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) were far apart, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had been
tainted by the slain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.

<p/>To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) through a
scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had
found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were
brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred, or to be released, or -LRB-in a few cases-RRB- to be sent back
to their cells. That, presented by his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) conductors to this Tribunal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and that this
man was Defarge.

<p/>That, hereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ascertained, through the registers on the table,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard
to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some
dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life
and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded
to him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and
examined. That, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) seemed on the point of being at once released, when
the tide in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) favour met with some unexplained check -LRB-not intelligible
to the Doctor-RRB-, which led to a few words of secret conference. That,
the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) sake, be held
inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), the
Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had obtained the permission, and
had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.

<p/>The sights he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved, had astounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said, who had
been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) passed out. Being besought to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and dress
the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies
of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged
anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.

<p/>As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) watched the face of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger.

<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had never seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) friend in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) present aspect: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had never
at all known him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) present character. For the first time the Doctor
felt, now, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) suffering was strength and power. For the first time
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) felt that in that sharp fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter's husband, and deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be
helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>); by the aid
of Heaven I will do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div>Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw
the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have been stopped, like a
clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed.

<p/>Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would
have yielded before his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) persevering purpose. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) kept himself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees
of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) used his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
personal influence so wisely, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) could now assure Lucie
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the
general body of prisoners; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband weekly, and brought sweet
messages to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), straight from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips; sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband himself
sent a letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) -LRB-though never by the Doctor's hand-RRB-, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was
not permitted to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>): for, among the many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.

<p/>This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the
sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that
time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) friend, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.
Now that this was changed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's
ultimate safety and deliverance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) became so far exalted by the change,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to
trust to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself
and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) who had rendered so much to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``All
curious to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Lorry, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) amiably shrewd way, <div class="bookquote">``but all
natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it
couldn't be in better hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) brought to trial,
the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). The new
era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death
against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the
great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils
of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and
had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and
alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of
the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds
and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the
fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.
What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year
One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,
and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!

<p/>There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no
measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when
time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other
count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever
of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the
unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the
head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the
head of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.

<p/>And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A
revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand
revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,
which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over
any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged
with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;
these things became the established order and nature of appointed
things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.
Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the
sharp female called La Guillotine.

<p/>It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a
peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which
shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window
and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the
human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts
from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and
believed in where the Cross was denied.

<p/>It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,
were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young
Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed
the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and
good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one
dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.
The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief
functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) was stronger than his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>)
namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every
day.

<p/>Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked
with a steady head: confident in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) power, cautiously persistent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
end, never doubting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) would save Lucie's husband at last. Yet the
current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time
away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three
months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more
wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,
that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the
violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the
terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in Paris at
that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable
in hospital and prison, using his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) art equally among assassins and
victims, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man apart. In the exercise of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skill, the
appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from all
other men. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were
a Spirit moving among mortals.




<p/>V. The Wood-Sawyer


<p/>One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never
sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
husband's head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the
tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright
women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and
old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all
daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons,
and carried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) through the streets to slake her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) devouring thirst.
Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to
bestow, O Guillotine!

<p/>If the suddenness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time,
had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle
despair, it would but have been with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as it was with many. But, from
the hour when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had taken the white head to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fresh young bosom in
the garret of Saint Antoine, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been true to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) duties. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was
truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good
will always be.

<p/>As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father
had entered on the routine of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) avocations, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arranged the little
household as exactly as if her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband had been there. Everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) taught,
as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The
slight devices with which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cheated herself into the show of a belief
that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) speedy
return, the setting aside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) chair and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) books--these, and the
solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many
unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only
outspoken reliefs of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heavy mind.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to
mourning dresses, which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) child wore, were as neat and as well
attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) colour,
and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,
thing; otherwise, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at
night on kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would burst into the grief she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had
repressed all day, and would say that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sole reliance, under Heaven,
was on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always resolutely answered: <div class="bookquote">``Nothing can happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), Lucie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
father said to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), on coming home one evening:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can
sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) can get to
it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might see you
in the street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can
show you. But you will not be able to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), my poor child, and even
if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>From that time, in all weathers, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) waited there two hours. As the
clock struck two, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was there, and at four she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) turned resignedly away.
When it was not too wet or inclement for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) child to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), they
went together; at other times she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was alone; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) never missed a
single day.

<p/>It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that
end; all else was wall. On the third day of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) being there, he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) noticed
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day, citizeness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day, citizen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been
established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;
but, was now law for everybody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walking here again, citizeness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see me, citizen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man mender</b></font>)</div><p/>The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had once been a mender of roads-RRB-, cast a glance at the prison, pointed
at the prison, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ten fingers before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face to represent
bars, peeped through them jocosely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's not my business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And went on sawing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wood.

<p/>Next day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looking out for her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Walking here again, citizeness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, citizen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I say yes, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dearest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, citizen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! But it's not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I
call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) head
comes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The billet fell as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw it into a basket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again!
Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)_ head comes! Now, a child.
Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the
family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucie shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw two more billets into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) basket, but it was
impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight. Thenceforth, to secure his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) always spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
first, and often gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drink-money, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) readily received.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had quite forgotten
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heart
up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) would come to herself to find him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>),
with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knee on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bench and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw stopped in its work. <div class="bookquote">``But it's
not my business!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would generally say at those times, and would
briskly fall to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sawing again.

<p/>In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of
spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again
in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at
this place; and every day on leaving it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) kissed the prison wall.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) -LRB-so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father-RRB- it might be once in
five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not
for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could and did
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) when the chances served, and on that possibility she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) would have
waited out the day, seven days a week.

<p/>These occupations brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) round to the December month, wherein her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing
afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild
rejoicing, and a festival. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had seen the houses, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) came along,
decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;
also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription
-LRB-tricoloured letters were the favourite-RRB-, Republic One and Indivisible.
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!

<p/>The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole
surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), however, who had squeezed Death in
with most inappropriate difficulty. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) house-top, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) displayed pike
and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had stationed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
saw inscribed as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Little Sainte Guillotine'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) shop was shut and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) quite alone.

<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was not far off, for presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along, which filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) with fear. A moment
afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with
The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and
they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music
than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,
keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.
Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced
together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a
mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they
filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They
advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one
another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest
linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then
reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped
again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width
of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once
innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the
heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly
bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the
delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
the disjointed time.

<p/>This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and
bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow
fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness

that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the
Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) could scarcely answer, <div class="bookquote">``I trust in you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shall

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They
both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring
away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see Lorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor repeated, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) another way.

<p/>The staunch old gentleman was still in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) trust; had never left it. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national. What he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could save for the owners, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saved. No
better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to
hold his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) peace.

<p/>A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted
the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the
Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and
deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters:
National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity, or Death!

<p/>Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the
chair--who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) come out,
agitated and surprised, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) favourite in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arms? To whom did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) appear to repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) faltering words, when, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) voice and
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head towards the door of the room from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had issued,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>VI. Triumph


<p/>The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined
Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were
read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The
standard gaoler-joke was, <div class="bookquote">``Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you
inside there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>La Force</b></font>)</div><p/>So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.

<p/>When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles
Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had seen
hundreds pass away so.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them
to assure himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) place, and went through the
list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three
names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so
summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been
guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber
where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human
creature he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had since cared for and parted with, had died on the
scaffold.

<p/>There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was
soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force
were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears
there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the
common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from
insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the
time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour
or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to
brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere
boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In
seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the
disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke
them.

<p/>The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its
vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were
put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called. All the fifteen
were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles Evremonde, called Darnay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was at length arraigned.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap
and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking
at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) might have thought that the
usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the
honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never
without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing
spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,
anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,
the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore
knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many
knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under
her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) arm as she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) worked. She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) was in a front row, by the side of a man whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never seen since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrival at the Barrier, but whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directly
remembered as Defarge. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) once or twice whispered in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ear, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) seemed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife; but, what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most noticed
in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be, they never looked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). They seemed to
be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at
the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and Mr.
Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who
wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
Carmagnole.

<p/>Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the
decree bore date since his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) return to France. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was, and there was
the decree; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been taken in France, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) head was demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Evremonde</b></font>) head!''  (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div>cried the audience. <div class="bookquote">``An enemy to the Republic!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The President</b></font>)</div><p/>The President rang his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) bell to silence those cries, and asked the
prisoner whether it was not true that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had lived many years in
England?

<p/>Undoubtedly it was.

<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) not an emigrant then? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) call himself?

<p/>Not an emigrant, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.

<p/>Why not? the President desired to know.

<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), and a station that was distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), and had left
his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) country--he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) own industry in
England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.

<p/>What proof had he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) of this?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and
Alexandre Manette.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) had married in England? the President reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>).

<p/>True, but not an English woman.

<p/>A citizeness of France?

<p/>Yes. By birth.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name and family?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who
sits there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div><p/>This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation
of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were
the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as
if with impatience to pluck him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) out into the streets and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).

<p/>On these few steps of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) foot
according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions. The same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>), and had prepared every
inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) road.

<p/>The President asked, why had he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) returned to France when he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) did, and not
sooner?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had not returned sooner, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) replied, simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had no means
of living in France, save those he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had resigned; whereas, in England,
he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.
He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had returned when he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) did, on the pressing and written entreaty of
a French citizen, who represented that his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) life was endangered by his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>)
absence. He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>)
testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal
in the eyes of the Republic?

<p/>The populace cried enthusiastically, <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>The populace</b></font>)</div>and the President rang his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>)
bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry <div class="bookquote">``No!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>until they left off, of their own will.

<p/>The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained
that the citizen was his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) first witness. He (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) also referred with confidence
to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) at the Barrier,
but which he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
the President.

<p/>The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) that
it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen
Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the
pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) had been slightly
overlooked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out
of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>)
had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) was
answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde,
called Darnay.

<p/>Doctor Manette was next questioned. His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) high personal popularity,
and the clearness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) answers, made a great impression; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
proceeded, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) showed that the Accused was his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) first friend on his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>)
release from his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in
England, always faithful and devoted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) daughter and himself in
their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat
government there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) had actually been tried for his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) life by it, as
the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) brought these
circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the
straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the
populace became one. At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) appealed by name to Monsieur
Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,
had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that
they were ready with their votes if the President were content to
receive them.

<p/>At every vote -LRB-the Jurymen voted aloud and individually-RRB-, the populace
set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner's
favour, and the President declared him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) free.

<p/>Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against
their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of
these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,
to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner
was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), that after
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) long and unwholesome confinement he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion; none the less because he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew very well, that the very same
people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) with
the very same intensity, to rend him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to pieces and strew him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) over the
streets.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,
rescued him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried
together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to
him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four
hours. The first of them told him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) so, with the customary prison sign
of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, <div class="bookquote">``Long live the
Republic!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
for when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great
crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had seen in
Court--except two, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) looked in vain. On his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) coming out, the
concourse made at him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by
turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the
shore.

<p/>They put him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) into a great chair they had among them, and which they had
taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.
Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they
had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not
even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) being carried to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) home
on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>),
and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) more than once misdoubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind being in confusion, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
was in the tumbril on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) way to the Guillotine.

<p/>In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) out, they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) on. Reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as
they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) thus into the courtyard of the building where he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) lived. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) father
had gone on before, to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) husband stood upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
feet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) dropped insensible in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) beautiful head between his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
face and the brawling crowd, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) lips might come
together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the
rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.
Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river's bank,
and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
them away.

<p/>After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stood victorious and proud
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>); after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in
breathless from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;
after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arms round
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who
lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms, and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) up to their
rooms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucie! My own! I am safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have
prayed to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was again in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France
could have done what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) father's breast, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) poor
head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own breast, long, long ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was happy in the return he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was recompensed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) suffering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
strength. <div class="bookquote">``You must not be weak, my darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) remonstrated; <div class="bookquote">``don't
tremble so. I have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>VII. A Knock at the Door


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>A Knock</b></font>)</div>It was not another of the dreams in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had
often come back; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was really here. And yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wife trembled, and a
vague but heavy fear was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately
revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on
vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband and as dear to others as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was to
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), every day shared the fate from which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been clutched, that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt it ought to be.
The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind pursued
them, looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) among the Condemned; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) clung closer to
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) real presence and trembled more.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, cheering her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), showed a compassionate superiority to this
woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,
no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had accomplished the task
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had set himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) promise was redeemed, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had saved Charles. Let
them all lean upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was
the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but
because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) imprisonment,
had had to pay heavily for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bad food, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) guard, and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and
partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and
citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them
occasional service; and Jerry -LRB-almost wholly transferred to them by
Mr. Lorry-RRB- had become their daily retainer, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bed there every
night.

<p/>It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every
house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.
Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had
employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called
Darnay.

<p/>In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor's little household, as
in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.

<p/>For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) long
association with a French family, might have known as much of their
language as of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had had a mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had no mind in that
direction; consequently she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) knew no more of that <div class="bookquote">``nonsense''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was
pleased to call it-RRB- than Mr. Cruncher did. So her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) manner of marketing
was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be
the name of the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold
of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) always
made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,
one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) number might be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Cruncher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;
<div class="bookquote">``if you are ready, I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had worn
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) rust off long ago, but nothing would file his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) spiky head down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's all manner of things wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and we shall
have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts
these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>retorted Jerry, <div class="bookquote">``whether they drink your health or the Old Un's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.

<p/>Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning <div class="bookquote">``Old
Nick's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the
meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder,
and Mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>cried Lucie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross; <div class="bookquote">``but I may say
among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the
streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!
Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your
pretty head from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you may take that liberty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor answered, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of
that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, dear! Again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>Lucie remonstrated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my sweet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``the
short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) Most Gracious
Majesty King George the Third;''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; <div class="bookquote">``and
as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish
tricks, On him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) our hopes we fix, God save the King!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words
after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you
had never taken that cold in your voice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, approvingly.
<div class="bookquote">``But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there'' (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>--it was the good creature's
way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--<div class="bookquote">``is there any
prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heigh-ho-hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, <div class="bookquote">``then we
must have patience and wait: that's all. We must hold up our heads and
fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don't
you move, Ladybird!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They went out, leaving Lucie, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, and the
child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the
Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in
a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie
sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) grandfather with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hands clasped through his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) arm: and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>),
in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) a story of
a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out
a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and
quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) cried, all at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, stopping in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) story, and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand
on hers, <div class="bookquote">``command yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The
least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father's daughter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face
and in a faltering voice, <div class="bookquote">``that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My love, the staircase is as still as Death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My child,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, rising, and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)
shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``I _have_ saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go
to the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) took the lamp in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,
and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough
men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who seeks him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>answered Darnay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). We seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the
Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The four surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) wife and child clinging
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will
know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
stood with the lamp in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) were a statue made to hold it,
moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting
the speaker, and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), not ungently, by the loose front of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) red
woollen shirt, said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), you have said. Do you know me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We all know you, Citizen Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said the other three.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice,
after a pause:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you answer his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) question to me then? How does this happen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Citizen Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the first, reluctantly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) has been denounced to
the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pointing out the second who
had entered, <div class="bookquote">``is from Saint Antoine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The citizen</b></font>)</div><p/>The citizen here indicated nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) head, and added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) is accused by Saint Antoine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The citizen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Citizen Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the first, with his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) former reluctance, <div class="bookquote">``ask no
more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as
a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all.
The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One word,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor entreated. <div class="bookquote">``Will you tell me who denounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is against rule,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the first; <div class="bookquote">``but you can ask Him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) of Saint
Antoine here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
feet, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) beard a little, and at length said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Truly it is against rule. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) is denounced--and gravely--by
the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, <div class="bookquote">``you will be
answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Antoine</b></font>)</div><p/>VIII. A Hand at Cards


<p/>Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) mind the number of indispensable purchases
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) side. They
both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It
was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing
lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were
stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the
Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got
undeserved promotion in it! Better for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beard had never
grown, for the National Razor shaved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) close.

<p/>Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil
for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
After peeping into several wine-shops, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) stopped at the sign of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,
once -LRB-and twice-RRB- the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same
description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was
not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,
attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) cavalier.

<p/>Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,
bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of
the others listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>); of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be
resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the
popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,
like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached
the counter, and showed what they wanted.

<p/>As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a
corner, and rose to depart. In going, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to face Miss Pross. No
sooner did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hands.

<p/>In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only
saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all
the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,
evidently English.

<p/>What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very
voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss
Pross and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no
ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that
not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,
Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) own separate and individual
account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;
speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice -LRB-though in a low tone-RRB-, and in
English.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Pross, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hands again.
<div class="bookquote">``After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,
do I find you here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the
man, in a furtive, frightened way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brother, brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. <div class="bookquote">``Have I ever
been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then hold your meddlesome tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/John/John Solomon</b></font>)</div>said Solomon, <div class="bookquote">``and come out, if you
want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who's this man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/John/John Solomon</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Pross, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) loving and dejected head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) by no means
affectionate brother, said through her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) tears, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cruncher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come out too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/John/John Solomon</b></font>)</div>said Solomon. <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) think me a ghost?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) looks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) said not a
word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) reticule
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) tears with great difficulty paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) wine. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) did
so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus
of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French
language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
pursuits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/John/John Solomon</b></font>)</div>said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, <div class="bookquote">``what do you
want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/John/John Solomon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
from!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``to give me such a greeting, and show me no
affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There. Confound it! There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/John/John Solomon</b></font>)</div>said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's
lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``Now are you content?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Pross only shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head and wept in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you expect me to be surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) brother Solomon, <div class="bookquote">``I am not
surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If
you really don't want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you
do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I
am an official.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/John/John Solomon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My English brother Solomon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>mourned Miss Pross, casting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
tear-fraught eyes, <div class="bookquote">``that had the makings in him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) of one of the best and
greatest of men in his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) native country, an official among foreigners, and
such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said so!''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) brother, interrupting. <div class="bookquote">``I knew it. You want to be
the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just
as I am getting on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Pross. <div class="bookquote">``Far
rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever
loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will
detain you no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any
culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years
ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) money and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging
condescension and patronage than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could have shown if their relative
merits and positions had been reversed -LRB-which is invariably the case,
all the world over-RRB-, when Mr. Cruncher, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) on the shoulder,
hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular
question:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,
or Solomon John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The official turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) with sudden distrust. He (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) had not
previously uttered a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher. <div class="bookquote">``Speak out, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Which, by the way,
was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) could do himself.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``John Solomon, or Solomon John? She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
calls you Solomon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must know, being your sister. And _I_ know
you're John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that
name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over the water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name
was, over the water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. T’other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness
at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to
yourself, was you called at that time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another voice, striking in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the name for a thousand pound!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>cried Jerry.

<p/>The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) hands behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) under the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) riding-coat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) stood at Mr. Cruncher's
elbow as negligently as he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself
elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present
myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a
better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad
was not a Sheep of the Prisons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sheep</b></font>)</div><p/>Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,
who was pale, turned paler, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) dared--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sydney. <div class="bookquote">``I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out
of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,
an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember
faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having
a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with
the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your
direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and
sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the
nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed
to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What purpose?''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>the spy asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the
street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your
company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Under a threat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Did I say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, why should I go there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you won't say, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>the spy irresolutely asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
quickness and skill, in such a business as he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) secret mind,
and with such a man as he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) had to do with. His (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) practised eye saw it, and
made the most of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I told you so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
sister; <div class="bookquote">``if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Mr. Barsad!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sydney. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be ungrateful.
But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so
pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I'll go with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,
at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort
knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) to Mr. Lorry's with us. Are we
ready? Come then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) life
remembered, that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hands on Sydney's arm and looked up
in his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) face, imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced
purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only
contradicted his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) light manner, but changed and raised the man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was
too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to
heed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) observed.

<p/>They left her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.
Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or Solomon
Pross, walked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) side.

<p/>Mr. Lorry had just finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) dinner, and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the
picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked
into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years
ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head as they entered, and showed the surprise with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw a stranger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Pross's brother, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Barsad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Barsad?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman Barsad</b></font>)</div>repeated the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``Barsad? I have an association
with the name--and with the face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman Barsad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Carton,
coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Pray sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took a chair himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,
by saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) with a frown, <div class="bookquote">``Witness at that trial.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry
immediately remembered, and regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) new visitor with an undisguised
look of abhorrence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate
brother you have heard of,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney, <div class="bookquote">``and has acknowledged the
relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``What do you
tell me! I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) safe and free within these two hours, and am about
to return to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now, if at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney, <div class="bookquote">``and I
have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep
over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) left the
messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no
earthly doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) is retaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something
might depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) presence of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) commanded himself, and was
silently attentive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I trust,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Sydney to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that the name and influence of
Doctor Manette may stand him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in as good stead to-morrow--you said he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I believe so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own
to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the
power to prevent this arrest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) may not have known of it beforehand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how
identified he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) is with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) son-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) troubled hand at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
chin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) troubled eyes on Carton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In short,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney, <div class="bookquote">``this is a desperate time, when desperate games
are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I
will play the losing one. No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one
carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the
stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend
in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.
Barsad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need have good cards, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a
brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was put before him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) drank off a glassful--drank off another
glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) went on, in the tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards: <div class="bookquote">``Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican
committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman
is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
Frenchman, represents himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) employers under a false name.
That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent
card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.
Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the
spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,
the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my
hand, Mr. Barsad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to understand your play,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section
Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't
hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
drank it off. He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) saw that the spy was fearful of his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) drinking himself
into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>). Seeing it, he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
poured out and drank another glassful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a poorer hand than he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards
in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) honourable
employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
there--not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) was not wanted there; our English reasons for
vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date--he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in
France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) own countrymen
there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>)
knew that under the overthrown government he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had been a spy upon Saint
Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police
such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment,
release, and history, as should serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) for an introduction to
familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame
Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) always remembered
with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and had looked ominously at him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers moved.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had since seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over
again produce her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the
guillotine then surely swallowed up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) knew, as every one employed as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was did, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was never safe; that flight was impossible; that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
terror, a word might bring it down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>). Once denounced, and on such
grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) foresaw
that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) had seen many
proofs, would produce against him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) that fatal register, and would quash
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon
terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify
the holder in growing rather livid as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) turned them over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You scarcely seem to like your hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney, with the greatest
composure. <div class="bookquote">``Do you play?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) turned to Mr.
Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to
put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) station to play that Ace
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is
considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by
somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so demean
himself as to make himself one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton, taking the answer on himself,
and looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) watch, <div class="bookquote">``without any scruple, in a very few minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have hoped, gentlemen both,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy that</b></font>)</div>said the spy, always striving to
hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, <div class="bookquote">``that your respect for my sister--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Sydney Carton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think not, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thoroughly made up my mind about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div><p/>The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) usual demeanour,
received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a
mystery to wiser and honester men than he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>),--that it faltered here and
failed him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>). While he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) former air
of contemplating cards:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I
have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and
fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;
who was he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``French. You don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``French, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
at all, though he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) echoed his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) word. <div class="bookquote">``Well; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy; <div class="bookquote">``though it's not important.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Though it's not important,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Carton, in the same mechanical
way--<div class="bookquote">``though it's not important--No, it's not important. No. Yet I know
the face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not. I am sure not. It can't be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It-can't-be,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
glass -LRB-which fortunately was a small one-RRB- again. <div class="bookquote">``Can't-be. Spoke good
French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Provincial,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Foreign!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Carton, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) open hand on the table, as a
light broke clearly on his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We
had that man before us at the Old Bailey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, there you are hasty, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div>said Barsad, with a smile that gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>)
aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; <div class="bookquote">``there you really give
me an advantage over you. Cly -LRB-who I will unreservedly admit, at this
distance of time, was a partner of mine-RRB- has been dead several years. I
attended him (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) last illness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) was buried in London, at the church
of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at the moment prevented my following his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) remains, but I helped
to lay him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) coffin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat, of a most remarkable
goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) discovered it
to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us be reasonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, <div class="bookquote">``and let us be fair. To show you
how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will
lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have
carried in my pocket-book,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>with a hurried hand he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) produced and opened
it, <div class="bookquote">``ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take
it in your hand; it's no forgery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and
Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) hair could not have been more
violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the
crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.

<p/>Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) side, and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) on
the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That there Roger Cly, master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and
iron-bound visage. <div class="bookquote">``So _you_ put him (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) coffin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who took him (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) out of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div><p/>Barsad leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) chair, and stammered, <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) warn't never in it. No! Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>)!
I'll have my head took off, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) was ever in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>said Jerry, <div class="bookquote">``that you buried paving-stones and earth in
that there coffin. Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a
take in. Me and two more knows it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that to you? Ecod!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``it's you I have got a
old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!
I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
explain himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At another time, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) returned, evasively, <div class="bookquote">``the present time is
ill-conwenient for explainin'. What I stand to, is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) knows well
wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) say he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) was,
in so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>)
throat and choke him (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) for half a guinea;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as
quite a liberal offer; <div class="bookquote">``or I'll out and announce him (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! I see one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton. <div class="bookquote">``I hold another card, Mr. Barsad.
Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for
you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another
aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has
the mystery about him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) of having feigned death and come to life again!
A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong
card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>returned the spy. <div class="bookquote">``I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular
with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk
of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this
man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you trouble your head about this man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>retorted the contentious
Mr. Cruncher; <div class="bookquote">``you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
that gentleman. And look here! Once more!'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Cruncher could not
be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
liberality--<div class="bookquote">``I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>The Sheep of the prisons turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) to Sydney Carton, and said,
with more decision, <div class="bookquote">``It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and
can't overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my
office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my
life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,
I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate
here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my
way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, firmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at the
Conciergerie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can be when you choose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can pass in and out when I choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
said, rising:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come
into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>IX. The Game Made


<p/>While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining
dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked
at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's
manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) changed the
leg on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) rested, as often as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had fifty of those limbs,
and were trying them all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) finger-nails with a very
questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an
infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``Come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) shoulders in advance
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you been, besides a messenger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>patron</b></font>)</div><p/>After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) patron,
Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, <div class="bookquote">``Agicultooral
character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mind misgives me much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's
as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
description. If you have, don't expect me to befriend you when you
get back to England. If you have, don't expect me to keep your secret.
Tellson's shall not be imposed upon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``that a gentleman like
yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it,
would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don't say it
is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if
it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side. There'd be two sides
to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>)
fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) half fardens--half fardens! no, nor
yet his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking
their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going
out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.
Well, that `ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's. For you cannot sarse the
goose and not the gander. And here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos
in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,
a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark
ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop--catch `em at
it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,
and how can you rightly have one without t'other? Then, wot with
undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot
with private watchmen -LRB-all awaricious and all in it-RRB-, a man wouldn't get
much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never
prosper with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mr. Lorry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)'d never have no good of it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)'d want
all along to be out of the line, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) way out, being
once in--even if it wos so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, <div class="bookquote">``I am shocked at
the sight of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Cruncher,
<div class="bookquote">``even if it wos so, which I don't say it is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't prevaricate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I will _not_, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crunches</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were
further from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thoughts or practice--<div class="bookquote">``which I don't say it is--wot I
would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at
that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to
be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till
your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it
wos so, which I still don't say it is -LRB-for I will not prewaricate to
you, sir-RRB-, let that there boy keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's place, and take care of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother; don't blow upon that boy's father--do not do it, sir--and
let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends
for what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin' of `em in with
a will, and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of `em safe.
That, Mr. Lorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crunches</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
arm, as an announcement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) had arrived at the peroration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
discourse, <div class="bookquote">``is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don't
see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in the way of Subjects
without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) serious thoughts of
things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you
fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good
cause when I might have kep' it back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That at least is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``Say no more now. It may be
that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
action--not in words. I want no more words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher knuckled his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy
returned from the dark room. <div class="bookquote">``Adieu, Mr. Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said the former; <div class="bookquote">``our
arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they
were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had done?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access
to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry's countenance fell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all I could do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton. <div class="bookquote">``To propose too much, would be
to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself said, nothing
worse could happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were denounced. It was obviously the
weakness of the position. There is no help for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But access to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``if it should go ill before the
Tribunal, will not save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said it would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sympathy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
darling, and the heavy disappointment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) second arrest, gradually
weakened them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tears fell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a good man and a true friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton, in an altered
voice. <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my
father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your
sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,
however.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said the last words, with a slip into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual manner, there
was a true feeling and respect both in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tone and in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) touch,
that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), was wholly
unprepared for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, and Carton gently pressed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To return to poor Darnay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton. <div class="bookquote">``Don't tell Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) of this
interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to go to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) the means of anticipating the sentence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked quickly at Carton to
see if it were in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind. It seemed to be; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) returned the look, and
evidently understood it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might think a thousand things,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Carton said, <div class="bookquote">``and any of them would
only add to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) trouble. Don't speak of me to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). As I said to you when
I first came, I had better not see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I can put my hand out, to do any
little helpful work for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that my hand can find to do, without that.
You are going to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), I hope? She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must be very desolate to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going now, directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of that. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
on you. How does she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) look?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It
attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the
fire. A light, or a shade -LRB-the old gentleman could not have said which-RRB-,
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
wild bright day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wore the white riding-coat
and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) look very pale, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) long brown hair,
all untrimmed, hanging loose about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) indifference to fire was
sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had
broken under the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said.

<p/>Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face. Taking note of the
wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having
the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was strongly
reminded of that expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Carton, turning
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so
unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to
have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have
my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton, wistfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in my seventy-eighth year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;
trusted, respected, and looked up to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I
may say that I was a man of business when a boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss
you when you leave it empty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A solitary old bachelor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``There
is nobody to weep for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say that? Wouldn't She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) weep for you? Wouldn't her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,
`I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or
respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no
regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!'
your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sydney turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a
few moments, said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the
days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Responding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw
closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and
nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances
that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother -LRB-and I so old!-RRB-,
and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not
so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand the feeling!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. <div class="bookquote">``And
you are the better for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) on with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) outer coat; <div class="bookquote">``But you,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, <div class="bookquote">``you
are young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton. <div class="bookquote">``I am not old, but my young way was never the way to
age. Enough of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And of me, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll walk with you to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) gate. You know my vagabond and restless
habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be
uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, unhappily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a
place for me. Take my arm, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A
few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>)
there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate
again when it was shut, and touched it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) had heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) going to
the prison every day. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) came out here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) said, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) steps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was ten o’clock at night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) stood before the prison of La Force,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) shop, was smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) pipe at his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) shop-door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, citizen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the
man eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquisitively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, citizen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How goes the Republic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount
to a hundred soon. Samson and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) men complain sometimes, of being
exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you often go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Barber</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) at work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,
citizen; he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less
than two pipes. Word of honour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>As the grinning little man held out the pipe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was smoking, to explain
how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire
to strike the life out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) turned away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not English,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the wood-sawyer, <div class="bookquote">``though you wear
English dress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak like a Frenchman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am an old student here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, citizen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But go and see that droll dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the little man persisted, calling after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And take a pipe with you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) stopped in the middle of
the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) pencil on a scrap
of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,
for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
terror--he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner was closing with
his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill
thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.

<p/>Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>)
counter, he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) laid the scrap of paper before him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Whew!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div>the chemist
whistled softly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) read it. <div class="bookquote">``Hi! hi! hi!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sydney Carton</b></font>)</div><p/>Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For you, citizen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chemist</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the
consequences of mixing them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Certain small packets were made and given to him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) put them, one by
one, in the breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) inner coat, counted out the money for them,
and deliberately left the shop. <div class="bookquote">``There is nothing more to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>),
glancing upward at the moon, <div class="bookquote">``until to-morrow. I can't sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) said these words
aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who
had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) road and saw its end.

<p/>Long ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had been famous among his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) earliest competitors as a
youth of great promise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) father to the grave. His (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)
mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been
read at his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) father's grave, arose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) mind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) went down the dark
streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing
on high above him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) that believeth in me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) were dead, yet shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) live: and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow
rising in him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,
and for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,
and still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of association that
brought the words home, like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep,
might have been easily found. He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) did not seek it, but repeated them and
went on.

<p/>With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers
were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and
profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon
the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets
along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among
the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn
interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for
the lighter streets.

<p/>Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy
shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the
people poured cheerfully out as he (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>) passed, and went chatting home. At
one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking
for a way across the street through the mud. He (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>) carried the child over,
and before the timid arm was loosed from his (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>) neck asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for a kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) that believeth
in me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) were dead, yet shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me, shall never die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words
were in the echoes of his (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>) feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm
and steady, he (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>) sometimes repeated them to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>) walked; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>)
heard them always.

<p/>The night wore out, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>) stood upon the bridge listening to the
water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the
sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,
and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to
Death's dominion.

<p/>But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden
of the night, straight and warm to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heart in its long bright rays.
And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light
appeared to span the air between him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and the sun, while the river
sparkled under it.

<p/>The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial
friend, in the morning stillness. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) walked by the stream, far from the
houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
bank. When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) awoke and was afoot again, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lingered there yet a little
longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the
stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--<div class="bookquote">``Like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
glided into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) view, floated by him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and died away. As its silent track
in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heart
for a merciful consideration of all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) poor blindnesses and errors,
ended in the words, <div class="bookquote">``I am the resurrection and the life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry was already out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) got back, and it was easy to surmise
where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a
little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh
himself, went out to the place of trial.

<p/>The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell
away from in dread--pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into an obscure corner among the crowd.
Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was there,
sitting beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) father.

<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) husband was brought in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) turned a look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), so
sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness, yet so courageous for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sake, that it called the healthy
blood into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face, brightened his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) glance, and animated his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart. If
there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) look, on Sydney
Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.

<p/>Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have
been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not
first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the
Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.

<p/>Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good
republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day
after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers perpetually hovering about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, whose appearance
gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,
cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.
Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.

<p/>Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.
No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,
murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye
in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one
another, before bending forward with a strained attention.

<p/>Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and
retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Evremonde</b></font>) last night. Suspected and
Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants,
one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished
privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,
called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.

<p/>To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.

<p/>The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Openly, President.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Therese Defarge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexandre Manette, physician.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><p/>A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor
Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had been seated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and
a fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My
daughter, and those dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), are far dearer to me than my life. Who
and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband
of my child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of
the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer
to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
Republic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) bell, and
with warmth resumed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>). Listen to what is
to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes looking around, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) lips trembling; his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter drew
closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). The craving man on the jury rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands together,
and restored the usual hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release,
and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.

 (<font color='red'><b>an woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: <div class="bookquote">``You were one of the

there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when

 (<font color='red'><b>an woman</b></font>)</div><p/>It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience,
thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) bell; but, The

 (<font color='red'><b>The President</b></font>)</div>wherein she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was likewise much commended.

when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to
the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a
stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is
that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens

solicitude at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, Doctor Manette keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes fixed on the

never taking his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) feasting wife, and all the other eyes there
intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as
follows.




<p/>X. The Substance of the Shadow


<p/>``I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and
afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write
it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I
and my sorrows are dust.

<p/>``These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with
difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed
with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope
has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have
noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I
solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right
mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the
truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they
be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.

<p/>``One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December -LRB-I think the
twenty-second of the month-RRB- in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired
part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air,
at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the
School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very
fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it
might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a
voice called to the driver to stop.

<p/>``The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) horses,
and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
door and alight before I came up with it.

<p/>``I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,
and -LRB-as far as I could see-RRB- face too.

<p/>```You are Doctor Manette?' said one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>```Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; `the young
physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two
has made a rising reputation in Paris?'

<p/>```Gentlemen,' I returned, `I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so
graciously.'

<p/>```We have been to your residence,' said the first, `and not being
so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of
overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?'

<p/>``The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words
were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.
They were armed. I was not.

<p/>```Gentlemen,' said I, `pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to
which I am summoned.'

<p/>``The reply to this was made by him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) who had spoken second. `Doctor,
your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to
enter the carriage?'

<p/>``I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both
entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The
carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.

<p/>``I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that
it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took
place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make
the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my
paper in its hiding-place.

<p/>*****

<p/>``The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and
emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the
Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards
when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently
stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by
a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in
answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavy riding glove, across the face.

<p/>``There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,
for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the
other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.

<p/>``From the time of our alighting at the outer gate -LRB-which we found
locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had
relocked-RRB-, I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was
conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,
lying on a bed.

<p/>``The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much
past twenty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was torn and ragged, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms were bound to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were
all portions of a gentleman's dress. On one of them, which was a fringed
scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble,
and the letter E.

<p/>``I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient;
for, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) restless strivings she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had turned over on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face on the
edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth, and was
in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the
corner caught my sight.

<p/>``I turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gently over, placed my hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast to calm her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) down, and looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes were dilated and
wild, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the
words, `My husband, my father, and my brother!' and then counted up to
twelve, and said, `Hush!' For an instant, and no more, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would pause
to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would repeat the cry, `My husband, my father, and my brother!' and
would count up to twelve, and say, `Hush!' There was no variation in the
order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment's
pause, in the utterance of these sounds.

<p/>```How long,' I asked, `has this lasted?'

<p/>``To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the
younger; by the elder, I mean him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) who exercised the most authority. It
was the elder who replied, `Since about this hour last night.'

<p/>```She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has a husband, a father, and a brother?'

<p/>```A brother.'

<p/>```I do not address her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brother?'

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answered with great contempt, `No.'

<p/>```She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has some recent association with the number twelve?'

<p/>``The younger brother impatiently rejoined, `With twelve o’clock?'

<p/>```See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breast, `how
useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming
to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There
are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.'

<p/>``The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, `There is
a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on
the table.

<p/>*****

<p/>``I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my
lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.

<p/>```Do you doubt them?' asked the younger brother.

<p/>```You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no
more.

<p/>``I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many
efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it
after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then
sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman
in attendance -LRB-wife of the man down-stairs-RRB-, who had retreated into
a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently
furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick
old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the
sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular
succession, with the cry, `My husband, my father, and my brother!' the
counting up to twelve, and `Hush!' The frenzy was so violent, that I had
not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to
them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement
in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much
soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the
figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more
regular.

<p/>``For the reason that my hand had this effect -LRB-I assume-RRB-, I had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,
before the elder said:

<p/>```There is another patient.'

<p/>``I was startled, and asked, `Is it a pressing case?'

<p/>```You had better see,' he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) carelessly answered; and took up a light.

<p/>*****

<p/>``The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which
was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling
to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and
there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of
the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to
pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial
and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in
this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my
captivity, as I saw them all that night.

<p/>``On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) head, lay a
handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) teeth set, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) right hand clenched on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>)
breast, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see
where his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>); but, I could see
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) was dying of a wound from a sharp point.

<p/>```I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. `Let me examine it.'

<p/>```I do not want it examined,' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) answered; `let it be.'

<p/>``It was under his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand, and I soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to let me move his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand away.
The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours
before, but no skill could have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) if it had been looked to
without delay. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder
brother, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
ebbing out, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were a fellow-creature.

<p/>```How has this been done, monsieur?' said I.

<p/>```A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),
and has fallen by my brother's sword--like a gentleman.'

<p/>``There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this
answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would
have been better if he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had died in the usual obscure routine of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
vermin kind. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
the boy, or about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fate.

<p/>``The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had spoken, and they now
slowly moved to me.

<p/>```Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are
proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but
we have a little pride left, sometimes. She (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)--have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), Doctor?'

<p/>``The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the
distance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) referred to them, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) were lying in our presence.

<p/>``I said, `I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>).'

<p/>```She (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these
Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we
have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say
so. She (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was a good girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was betrothed to a good young man, too: a
tenant of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). We were all tenants of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--that man's who stands there.
The other is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother, the worst of a bad race.'

<p/>``It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak; but, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.

<p/>```We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs
are by those superior Beings--taxed by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without mercy, obliged to
work for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mill, obliged
to feed scores of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we
ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed,
and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should
most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable
race die out!'

<p/>``I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth
like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the
dying boy.

<p/>```Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was ailing at that time,
poor fellow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) lover, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might tend and comfort
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had not
been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and admired
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and asked that man to lend her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--for what are husbands among
us! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and
hated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother with a hatred as strong as mine. What did the two
then, to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband to use his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) influence with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), to make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
willing?'

<p/>``The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the
looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said was true. The two
opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this
Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasant's, all
trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.

<p/>```You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) and
drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>). You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their
grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed. They kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) out in the unwholesome mists at
night, and ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) harness in the day. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) was
not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>)
could find food--he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the
bell, and died on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) bosom.'

<p/>``Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) determination to
tell all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forced back the gathering shadows of death, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forced his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
wound.

<p/>```Then, with that man's permission and even with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aid, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
brother took her (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) away; in spite of what I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) must have told his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if
it is now--his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) brother took her (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) away--for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) pleasure and diversion,
for a little while. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) pass me on the road. When I took the
tidings home, our father's heart burst; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never spoke one of the words
that filled it. I took my young sister -LRB-for I have another-RRB- to a place
beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will never be
_his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed
in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window? It was
somewhere here?'

<p/>``The room was darkening to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sight; the world was narrowing around
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.

<p/>```She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heard me, and ran in. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) not to come near us till he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck
at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) draw. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) break into as many pieces as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will, the sword
that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stained with my common blood; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) drew to defend himself--thrust
at me with all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) skill for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life.'

<p/>``My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of
a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman's. In
another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's.

<p/>```Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)?'

<p/>```He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
referred to the brother.

<p/>```He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)! Proud as these nobles are, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is afraid to see me. Where is the
man who was here? Turn my face to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).'

<p/>``I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. But, invested for the
moment with extraordinary power, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) raised himself completely: obliging
me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>```Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes opened wide, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) right hand raised, `in the days when all these things are to be
answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to
answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that
I do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for,
I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them
separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as a sign that I do
it.'

<p/>``Twice, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand to the wound in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) breast, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
forefinger drew a cross in the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dropped with it, and I laid him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
down dead.

<p/>*****

<p/>``When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raving
in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last
for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave.

<p/>``I repeated the medicines I had given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and I sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never abated the piercing
quality of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words. They were always `My husband, my father, and my brother!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve. Hush!'

<p/>``This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I had
come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to
falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and
by-and-bye she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.

<p/>``It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and
fearful storm. I released her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, and called the woman to assist me to
compose her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure and the dress she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had torn. It was then that I knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had
had of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>```Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the
elder brother, coming booted into the room from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) horse.

<p/>```Not dead,' said I; `but like to die.'

<p/>```What strength there is in these common bodies!' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, looking down
at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with some curiosity.

<p/>```There is prodigious strength,' I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), `in sorrow and
despair.'

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) moved a
chair with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a
subdued voice,

<p/>```Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I
recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high,
and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful
of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen,
and not spoken of.'

<p/>``I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering.

<p/>```Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?'

<p/>```Monsieur,' said I, `in my profession, the communications of patients
are always received in confidence.' I was guarded in my answer, for I
was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.

<p/>``Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I
resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.

<p/>*****

<p/>``I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or
failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that
was ever spoken between me and those brothers.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few
syllables that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) said to me, by placing my ear close to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
asked me where she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); who I was, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). It
was in vain that I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) family name. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) faintly shook her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
head upon the pillow, and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) secret, as the boy had done.

<p/>``I had no opportunity of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) any question, until I had told the
brothers she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until
then, though no one was ever presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) consciousness save the
woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to
that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); as
if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.

<p/>``I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brother's -LRB-as I call him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)-RRB- having crossed swords with a peasant, and that
peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger
brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) disliked me deeply,
for knowing what I knew from the boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was smoother and more polite to
me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance
in the mind of the elder, too.

<p/>``My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch,
answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I was alone
with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), when her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and
all her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.

<p/>``The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride
away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with
their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.

<p/>```At last she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is dead?' said the elder, when I went in.

<p/>```She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is dead,' said I.

<p/>```I congratulate you, my brother,' were his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) words as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turned round.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) now
gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand, but laid it on
the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept
nothing.

<p/>```Pray excuse me,' said I. `Under the circumstances, no.'

<p/>``They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to
them, and we parted without another word on either side.

<p/>*****

<p/>``I am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery. I cannot read what I
have written with this gaunt hand.

<p/>``Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously
considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately
to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been
summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the
circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities
of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be
heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a
profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state
in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but
I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.

<p/>``I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that
night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it.
It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just
completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.

<p/>*****

<p/>``I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is
so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so
dreadful.

<p/>``The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long
life. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in great agitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) presented herself to me as the
wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the
boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered
on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I
had seen that nobleman very lately.

<p/>``My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our
conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I
know not at what times I may be watched. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had in part suspected, and
in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's
share in it, and my being resorted to. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not know that the girl
was dead. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hope had been, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said in great distress, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
in secret, a woman's sympathy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hope had been to avert the wrath of
Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nothing
but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope
that I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this
wretched hour I am ignorant of both.

<p/>*****

<p/>``These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning,
yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) marriage. How
could she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) be! The brother distrusted and disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) influence
was all opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stood in dread of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and in dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
husband too. When I handed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) down to the door, there was a child, a
pretty boy from two to three years old, in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) carriage.

<p/>```For his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sake, Doctor,' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, pointing to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in tears, `I would do
all I can to make what poor amends I can. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will never prosper in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent
atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). What
I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few
jewels--I will make it the first charge of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life to bestow, with the
compassion and lamenting of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dead mother, on this injured family, if
the sister can be discovered.'

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) kissed the boy, and said, caressing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), `It is for thine own dear
sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?' The child answered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
bravely, `Yes!' I kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) arms, and
went away caressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) more.

<p/>``As she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband's name in the faith that I knew it,
I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not
trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.

<p/>``That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o’clock, a man in
a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed
my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came
into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart!
My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at
the gate, standing silent behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>``An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. It would not detain me,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a coach in waiting.

<p/>``It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the
house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and
my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark
corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light
of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) foot.
Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living
grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of
my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
dead--I might have thought that He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not quite abandoned them. But,
now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that
they have no part in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercies. And them and their descendants, to the
last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last
night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times
when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven
and to earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A
sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,
and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.

<p/>Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show
how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured
Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their
time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been
anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.
The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have
sustained him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in that place that day, against such denunciation.

<p/>And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a
well-known citizen, his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) own attached friend, the father of his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) wife. One
of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and
self-immolations on the people's altar. Therefore when the President
said -LRB-else had his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) own head quivered on his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) shoulders-RRB-, that the good
physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by
rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) daughter a widow and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) child an
orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of
human sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much influence around him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>), has that Doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>murmured Madame Defarge,
smiling to The Vengeance. <div class="bookquote">``Save him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) now, my Doctor, save him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>every juryman</b></font>)</div><p/>At every juryman's vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and
roar.

<p/>Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy
of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the
Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!




<p/>XI. Dusk


<p/>The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
the sentence, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been mortally stricken. But, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) uttered no
sound; and so strong was the voice within her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), representing that it was
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of all the world who must uphold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misery and not augment
it, that it quickly raised her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), even from that shock.

<p/>The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors,
the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court's
emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood
stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arms towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband, with nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) face
but love and consolation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I might touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)! If I might embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) once! O, good citizens, if
you would have so much compassion for us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a gaoler</b></font>)</div><p/>There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had
taken him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the
show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) embrace
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) then; it is but a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div>It was silently acquiesced in, and they
passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>), by
leaning over the dock, could fold her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We
shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>They were her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband's words, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) bosom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don't suffer
for me. A parting blessing for our child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I send it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) by you. I kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) by you. I say farewell to her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) by
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband. No! A moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) was tearing himself apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart
by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), God
will raise up friends for her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), as He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), and would have fallen on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knees to both
of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), crying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel
to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know, now what
you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We
know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and
duty. Heaven be with you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father's only answer was to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hands through his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) white hair,
and wring them with a shriek of anguish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It could not be otherwise,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>said the prisoner. <div class="bookquote">``All things have worked
together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to
discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence
near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in
nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven
bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was drawn away, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wife released him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and stood looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and
with a radiant look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face, in which there was even a comforting
smile. As he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) went out at the prisoners' door, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned, laid her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head
lovingly on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's breast, tried to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and fell at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
feet.

<p/>Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never moved,
Sydney Carton came and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) up. Only her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) father and Mr. Lorry were
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm trembled as it raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), and supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) head.
Yet, there was an air about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) that was not all of pity--that had a
flush of pride in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to a coach? I shall never feel her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) weight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) lightly to the door, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) tenderly down in a
coach. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) father and their old friend got into it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seat
beside the driver.

<p/>When they arrived at the gateway where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had paused in the dark not
many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of
the street her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) feet had trodden, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) again, and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) up
the staircase to their rooms. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) down on a couch, where
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) child and Miss Pross wept over her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't recall her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, softly, to the latter, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is
better so. Don't revive her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to consciousness, while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only faints.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>cried little Lucie, springing up and
throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arms passionately round him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), in a burst of grief. <div class="bookquote">``Now that
you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to
save papa! O, look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who
love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), bear to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bent over the child, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) blooming cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) gently from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) unconscious mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before I go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, and paused--<div class="bookquote">``I may kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was remembered afterwards that when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bent down and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) face
with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), told them afterwards, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) grandchildren when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was a
handsome old lady, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``A life you love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had gone out into the next room, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, who were following, and said to the latter:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least
be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to
you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
strongest assurances that I should save him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); and I did.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) returned the
answer in great trouble, and very slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few
and short, but try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I intend to try. I will not rest a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before
now--though never,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) added, with a smile and a sigh together, <div class="bookquote">``such
great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse
it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it
were not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor Manette</b></font>)</div>said Doctor Manette, <div class="bookquote">``to the Prosecutor and the President
straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will

one will be accessible until dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor Manette</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the
forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you

these dread powers, Doctor Manette?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May you prosper!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) on the
shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was going away, caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor have I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm upon the door-post, and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face upon it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't despond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Carton, very gently; <div class="bookquote">``don't grieve. I encouraged

consolatory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>). Otherwise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) might think `his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) life was wantonly

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Lorry, drying his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``you are right.

<p/>And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.




<p/>XII. Darkness


<p/>Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. <div class="bookquote">``At
Tellson's banking-house at nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said, with a musing face. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I
do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that
these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound
precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!
Let me think it out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took a
turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind to its possible consequences. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) first impression was
confirmed. <div class="bookquote">``It is best,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said, finally resolved, <div class="bookquote">``that these people
should know there is such a man as I here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face
towards Saint Antoine.

<p/>Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in
the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city
well, to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) house without asking any question. Having ascertained
its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined
at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the
first time in many years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) had no strong drink. Since last night he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>)
had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) had
dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who had
done with it.

<p/>It was as late as seven o’clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) awoke refreshed, and went out
into the streets again. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed along towards Saint Antoine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>)
stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) loose cravat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) coat-collar, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) wild hair. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) went on direct to Defarge's, and went in.

<p/>There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen upon
the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the
Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like
a regular member of the establishment.

<p/>As Carton walked in, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) seat and asked -LRB-in very indifferent
French-RRB- for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless
glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) herself, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) had ordered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) repeated what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) had already said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``English?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dark
eyebrows.

<p/>After looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as if the sound of even a single French word were
slow to express itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) answered, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) former strong foreign
accent. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, madame, yes. I am English!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Defarge returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) counter to get the wine, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>)
took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``I swear to you, like Evremonde!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Defarge brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) the wine, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) Good Evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Good evening, citizen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) glass. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! and good wine. I
drink to the Republic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Defarge went back to the counter, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Certainly, a little like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Madame sternly retorted, <div class="bookquote">``I tell you a good deal like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Jacques Three
pacifically remarked, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) is so much in your mind, see you, madame.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my faith! And you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) once more
to-morrow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Carton followed the lines and words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) paper, with a slow
forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence
of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) without
disturbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed
their conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true what madame says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques</b></font>)</div>observed Jacques Three. <div class="bookquote">``Why stop? There
is great force in that. Why stop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>reasoned Defarge, <div class="bookquote">``but one must stop somewhere. After all,
the question is still where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At extermination,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Magnificent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques</b></font>)</div>croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly
approved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, rather
troubled; <div class="bookquote">``in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has
suffered much; you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to-day; you have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face when
the paper was read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. I have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face. I have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face to be not the
face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) take care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have observed, my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,
<div class="bookquote">``the anguish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated madame; <div class="bookquote">``yes, I have observed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter, more times than one. I have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to-day, and I
have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) other days. I have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in the court, and
I have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my
finger--!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) seemed to raise it -LRB-the listener's eyes were always on
his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) paper-RRB-, and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>), as
if the axe had dropped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The citizeness is superb!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>croaked the Juryman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is an Angel!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said The Vengeance, and embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>pursued madame, implacably, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``if it
depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this
man even now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>protested Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I
would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See you then, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; <div class="bookquote">``and see you,
too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as
tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,
doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>assented Defarge, without being asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) finds
this paper of to-day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brings it home, and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,
by the light of this lamp. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), is that so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>assented Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That night, I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), when the paper is read through, and the lamp is
burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between
those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), is
that so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>assented Defarge again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I communicate to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that secret. I smite this bosom with these two
hands as I smite it now, and I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), `Defarge, I was brought up
among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured
by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my
family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground
was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child
was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,
those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things
descends to me!' Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), is that so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>assented Defarge once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned madame; <div class="bookquote">``but don't
tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Both hearers</b></font>)</div><p/>Both her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) wrath--the listener could feel how white she (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) was, without seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>)--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed
a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but
only elicited from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own wife a repetition of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) last reply. <div class="bookquote">``Tell
the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Customers</b></font>)</div><p/>Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer
paid for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had had, perplexedly counted his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) change, and asked, as
a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge
took him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) to the door, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arm on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), in pointing out the road.
The English customer was not without his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) reflections then, that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and
deep.

<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall. At the appointed hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) emerged from it to present
himself in Mr. Lorry's room again, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been with Lucie
until just now, and had only left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) for a few minutes, to come and
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) appointment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had not been seen, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) quitted the
banking-house towards four o’clock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had some faint hopes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been
more than five hours gone: where could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) be?

<p/>Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
should go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), and come to the banking-house again at midnight.
In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette
did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and
brought none. Where could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) be?

<p/>They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) prolonged absence, when they heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) on
the stairs. The instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) entered the room, it was plain that all was
lost.

<p/>Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had really been to any one, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been all that
time traversing the streets, was never known. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stood staring at
them, they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) no question, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face told them everything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot find it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I must have it. Where is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head and throat were bare, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) spoke with a helpless look
straying all around, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) coat off, and let it drop on the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I
can't find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must
finish those shoes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), in a whimpering miserable way; <div class="bookquote">``let me get to
work. Give me my work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Receiving no answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) tore his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hair, and beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) feet upon the
ground, like a distracted child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't torture a poor forlorn wretch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) implored them, with a dreadful
cry; <div class="bookquote">``but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are
not done to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lost, utterly lost!

<p/>It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), or try to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>),
that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoulder, and
soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) should
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) work presently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sank into the chair, and brooded over the
embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret
time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shrink into
the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.

<p/>Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle
of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lonely
daughter, bereft of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) final hope and reliance, appealed to them both
too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with
one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had better be taken
to her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>). But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to
me? Don't ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and
exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``Say on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the
night.

<p/>Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
feet. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) day's duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton
took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. <div class="bookquote">``We should look
at this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said. Mr. Lorry nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) opened it, and
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Thank _God!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) coat, and took another paper from it, <div class="bookquote">``that is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton,
an Englishman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry held it open in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, gazing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) earnest face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) to-morrow, you
remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor
Manette has carried about him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>). It is a similar certificate, enabling him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the
frontier! You see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) obtained it as his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) last and utmost precaution against evil,

up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until
within this hour or two, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) had, or could have such a paper. It is
good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to
think, will be.''

put the old man's hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) did not part from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers,
as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find
where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought
to have. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) walked on the other side of it and protected it to the
courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in
the memorable time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own desolate heart to
it--outwatched the awful night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) entered the courtyard and remained
there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) room. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) went away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breathed a blessing towards it, and a
Farewell.




<p/>XIII. Fifty-two


<p/>In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited
their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were
to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless
everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants
were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday,
the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set
apart.

<p/>Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy,
whose riches could not buy his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>). Physical diseases, engendered
in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;
and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,
intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally
without distinction.

<p/>Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) came to it from the Tribunal. In every line
of the narrative he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) condemnation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>),
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could
avail him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) nothing.

<p/>Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) beloved wife fresh
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), to compose his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) mind to what it must bear. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hold on life
was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts
and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,
this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) thoughts,
a turbulent and heated working of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) heart, that contended against
resignation. If, for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) did feel resigned, then his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) wife and
child who had to live after him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), seemed to protest and to make it a
selfish thing.

<p/>But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there
was no disgrace in the fate he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) must meet, and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) quiet fortitude. So,
by degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) calmed into the better state, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.

<p/>Before it had set in dark on the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) condemnation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had
travelled thus far on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) last way. Being allowed to purchase the means
of writing, and a light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) sat down to write until such time as the
prison lamps should be extinguished.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had known nothing
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father's imprisonment, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had heard of it from herself,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been as ignorant as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) father's and uncle's
responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had
already explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) concealment from herself of the name
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>),
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father's sake, never to seek to know whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had
become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled
to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) -LRB-for the moment, or for good-RRB-, by the story of the Tower, on
that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had found no
mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
besought her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)--though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew it was needless--to console
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father, by impressing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) through every tender means she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could think
of, with the truth that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done nothing for which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could justly
reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
sakes. Next to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) preservation of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own last grateful love and
blessing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) overcoming of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sorrow, to devote herself to their
dear child, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) adjured her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
father.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote in the same strain; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
father that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expressly confided his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife and child to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) care. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from any
despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) foresaw he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might be
tending.

<p/>To Mr. Lorry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) commended them all, and explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) worldly affairs.
That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment, all was done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) never thought of Carton. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind was so
full of the others, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) never once thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lay down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) straw bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had done with this world.

<p/>But, it beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sleep, and showed itself in shining
forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho -LRB-though it had
nothing in it like the real house-RRB-, unaccountably released and light of
heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was with Lucie again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) it was all a dream, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had even
suffered, and had come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), dead and at peace, and yet there
was no difference in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>). Another pause of oblivion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) awoke in the
sombre morning, unconscious where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was or what had happened, until it
flashed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">``this is the day of my death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads
were to fall. And now, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was composed, and hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could
meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) waking
thoughts, which was very difficult to master.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) life. How
high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would be
stood, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed
red, which way his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face would be turned, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would be the first,
or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise
directed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless
times. Neither were they connected with fear: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was conscious of no
fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), than his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own.

<p/>The hours went on as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the
numbers he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for
ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had got the better of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) walked up and down, softly
repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for
himself and for them.

<p/>Twelve gone for ever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would
be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) resolved to keep Two
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.

<p/>Walking regularly to and fro with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms folded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breast, a very
different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heard One struck away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), without surprise. The hour had
measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)
recovered self-possession, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``There is but another now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
turned to walk again.

<p/>Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stopped.

<p/>The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or
as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has never seen
me here; I have kept out of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose
no time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
face to face, quiet, intent upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with the light of a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
features, and a cautionary finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip, Sydney Carton.

<p/>There was something so bright and remarkable in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look, that, for the
first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to be an apparition of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own
imagining. But, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) spoke, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) voice; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) took the prisoner's
hand, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) real grasp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You
are not'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--the apprehension came suddenly into his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) mind--<div class="bookquote">``a prisoner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)--your
wife, dear Darnay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The prisoner</b></font>)</div><p/>The prisoner wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I bring you a request from her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well
remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The prisoner</b></font>)</div><p/>The prisoner turned his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face partly aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have
no time to tell you. You must comply with it--take off those boots you
wear, and draw on these of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got
him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) down into it, and stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), barefoot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to
them. Quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You
will only die with me. It is madness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you
to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change
that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do
it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like
this of mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action,
that appeared quite supernatural, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) forced all these changes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
The prisoner was like a young child in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never
can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you
not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,
refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand
steady enough to write?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was when you came in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.
Carton, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) right hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) breast, stood close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Write exactly as I speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To whom do I address it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To no one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Carton still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I date it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The prisoner</b></font>)</div><p/>The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) with
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) breast, looked down.

<p/>```If you remember,''' said Carton, dictating, ```the words that passed
between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.'''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) breast; the prisoner chancing to look
up in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hurried wonder as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon
something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you written `forget them'?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Carton asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I am not armed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it in your hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
dictated again. ```I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove
them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.''' As he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said these
words with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes fixed on the writer, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand slowly and softly
moved down close to the writer's face.

<p/>The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) looked about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) vacantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What vapour is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vapour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something that crossed me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen
and finish. Hurry, hurry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div><p/>As if his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) memory were impaired, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) faculties disordered, the
prisoner made an effort to rally his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) attention. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) looked at Carton
with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)
hand again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) breast--looked steadily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurry, hurry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The prisoner</b></font>)</div><p/>The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.

<p/>```If it had been otherwise;''' Carton's hand was again watchfully and
softly stealing down; ```I never should have used the longer opportunity.
If it had been otherwise;''' the hand was at the prisoner's face; ```I
should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been
otherwise--''' Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
unintelligible signs.

<p/>Carton's hand moved back to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) breast no more. The prisoner sprang up
with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) round the waist. For a few
seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>)
life for him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>); but, within a minute or so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) was stretched insensible on
the ground.

<p/>Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) heart was, Carton
dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
softly called, <div class="bookquote">``Enter there! Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the Spy presented himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Carton, looking up, as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) kneeled on one knee beside the
insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: <div class="bookquote">``is your hazard very
great?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carton,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Spy</b></font>)</div>the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``my
hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to
the whole of your bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Spy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't fear me. I will be true to the death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being
made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the
rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and
take me to the coach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Spy</b></font>)</div>said the Spy nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which
you brought me in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you
take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has
happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands.
Quick! Call assistance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You swear not to betray me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Spy</b></font>)</div>said the trembling Spy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) paused for a
last moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Man, man!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Carton, stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) foot; <div class="bookquote">``have I sworn by no
solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious
moments now? Take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yourself to the courtyard you know of, place
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yourself in the carriage, show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
yourself to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no restorative but air, and to remember my words of
last night, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) promise of last night, and drive away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Spy</b></font>)</div><p/>The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>)
forehead on his (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. <div class="bookquote">``So
afflicted to find that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
Sainte Guillotine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good patriot,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, <div class="bookquote">``could hardly have been more afflicted
if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The time is short, Evremonde,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Spy</b></font>)</div>said the Spy, in a warning voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Carton. <div class="bookquote">``Be careful of my friend, I entreat
you, and leave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then, my children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div>said Barsad. <div class="bookquote">``Lift him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and come away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><p/>The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) powers of
listening to the utmost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) listened for any sound that might denote
suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,
footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry
made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>)
sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.

<p/>Sounds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) was not afraid of, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) divined their meaning, then
began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and
finally his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) own. A gaoler, with a list in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) hand, looked in, merely
saying, <div class="bookquote">``Follow me, Evremonde!''  (<font color='red'><b>A gaoler</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) followed into a large dark room,
at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows
within, and what with the shadows without, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) could but dimly discern
the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were
standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;
but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking
fixedly at the ground.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two
were brought in after him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), one man stopped in passing, to embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
as having a knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It thrilled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a great dread of
discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young
woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was
no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from
the seat where he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had observed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sitting, and came to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Citizen Evremonde,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cold hand. <div class="bookquote">``I am a
poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) murmured for answer: <div class="bookquote">``True. I forget what you were accused of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it
likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
like me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The forlorn smile with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said it, so touched him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), that tears
started from his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I
am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good
to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,
Citizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!''

 (<font color='red'><b>this girl</b></font>)</div><p/>As the last thing on earth that his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) heart was to warm and soften to, it
warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was. But, I was again taken and condemned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your
hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me
more courage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>patient</b></font>)</div><p/>As the patient eyes were lifted to his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) saw a sudden doubt in
them, and then astonishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young
fingers, and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you dying for him (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) wife and child. Hush! Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a coach</b></font>)</div><p/>*****

<p/>The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that
same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about
it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The papers are handed out, and read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This is he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>); this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man
pointed out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) right mind? The
Revolution-fever will have been too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Greatly too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) daughter. French. Which is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It is.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child. English.
This is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and no other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican;
something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton. Advocate.
English. Which is he (<font color='blue'><b>Advocate</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, is pointed out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It is hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is
under the displeasure of the Republic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the
displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window.
Jarvis Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>). Necessarily, being the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It
is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand on the coach
door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the
carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it
carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to
the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its
mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of
an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can depart, citizen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) clasps his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, and
looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there
is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much;
it would rouse suspicion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,
dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless
trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on
either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the
stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and
sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our
wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing
anything but stopping.

<p/>Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary
farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,
avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back
by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,
no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!
the posting-house.

<p/>Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in
the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it
of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible
existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and
plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count
their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.
All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would
far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.

<p/>At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left
behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and
on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with
animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their
haunches. We are pursued?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis Lorry/Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How many did they say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty-two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it
forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes
handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The night comes on dark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) moves more; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) is beginning to revive, and
to speak intelligibly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thinks they are still together; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>),
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) name, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help
us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.

<p/>The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and
the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.




<p/>XIV. The Knitting Done


<p/>In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate
Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and
Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame
Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,
erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But our Defarge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>said Jacques Three, <div class="bookquote">``is undoubtedly a good
Republican? Eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no better,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the voluble Vengeance protested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) shrill
notes, <div class="bookquote">``in France.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Peace, little Vengeance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) hand with
a slight frown on her (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) lieutenant's lips, <div class="bookquote">``hear me speak. My husband,
fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he (<font color='blue'><b>Republican</b></font>) has deserved
well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) weaknesses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) head,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) cruel fingers at his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) hungry mouth; <div class="bookquote">``it is not quite like a good
citizen; it is a thing to regret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame, <div class="bookquote">``I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) may wear
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head or lose it, for any interest I have in him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>); it is all one to
me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and
child must follow the husband and father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has a fine head for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques</b></font>)</div>croaked Jacques Three. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held
them up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ogre</b></font>)</div>Ogre that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) spoke like an epicure.

<p/>Madame Defarge cast down her (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) eyes, and reflected a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The child also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child
there. It is a pretty sight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, coming out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) short abstraction,
<div class="bookquote">``I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since
last night, that I dare not confide to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the details of my projects;
but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) giving warning,
and then they might escape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That must never be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>croaked Jacques Three; <div class="bookquote">``no one must escape. We
have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Defarge went on, <div class="bookquote">``my husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reason for
regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,
therefore. Come hither, little citizen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>The wood-sawyer, who held her (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) in the respect, and himself in the
submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) red cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Touching those signals, little citizen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, sternly,
<div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them
this very day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, why not!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sawyer</b></font>)</div>cried the sawyer. <div class="bookquote">``Every day, in all weathers, from
two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes
without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) made all manner of gestures while he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) spoke, as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) had
never seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clearly plots,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>said Jacques Three. <div class="bookquote">``Transparently!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no doubt of the Jury?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>inquired Madame Defarge, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>)
eyes turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) with a gloomy smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my
fellow-Jurymen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, pondering again. <div class="bookquote">``Yet once more!
Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can
I spare him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would count as one head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.
<div class="bookquote">``We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was signalling with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>argued Madame Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``I
cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and
trust the case wholly to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), this little citizen here. For, I am not a
bad witness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) to be a
celestial witness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) must take his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``No, I cannot spare
him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)! You are engaged at three o’clock; you are going to see the batch of
to-day executed.--You?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was the most ardent
of Republicans, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) would be in effect the most desolate of
Republicans, if anything prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was so very demonstrative herein, that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) might have been
suspected -LRB-perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) out of Madame Defarge's head-RRB- of having his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) small individual fears
for his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) own personal safety, every hour in the day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame, <div class="bookquote">``am equally engaged at the same place. After it is
over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we
will give information against these people at my Section.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The wood-sawyer said he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) would be proud and flattered to attend the
citizeness. The citizeness looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) became embarrassed, evaded
her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wood, and
hid his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) confusion over the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) saw.

<p/>Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to
the door, and there expounded her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) further views to them thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) death. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will
be mourning and grieving. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will be in a state of mind to impeach the
justice of the Republic. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will be full of sympathy with its enemies.
I will go to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jacques
Three, rapturously. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my cherished!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried The Vengeance; and
embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take you my knitting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, placing it in her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
lieutenant's hands, <div class="bookquote">``and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep
me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual, to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said The Vengeance with
alacrity, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">``You will not be late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be there before the commencement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said
The Vengeance, calling after her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had already turned into the
street, <div class="bookquote">``before the tumbrils arrive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Defarge slightly waved her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) hand, to imply that she (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) heard, and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the
mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the
Juryman, looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) walked away, were highly appreciative
of her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) fine figure, and her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) superb moral endowments.

<p/>There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman, now taking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way along the streets. Of a
strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great
determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have
heaved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,
opportunity had developed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into a tigress. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was absolutely without
pity. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had ever had the virtue in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), it had quite gone out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>It was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forefathers; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw, not him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but them. It was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife was to be made a widow and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter an orphan; that was
insufficient punishment, because they were her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) natural enemies and
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), was made
hopeless by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had
been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been engaged, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would not have pitied herself; nor, if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had
been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) there.

<p/>Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rough robe. Carelessly
worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
dark hair looked rich under her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) waist, was a sharpened
dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way along the streets.

<p/>Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,
the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's
attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.
Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross
and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at
three o’clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.
Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,
passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in
advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.

<p/>Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) and Jerry had
beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, whose agitation
was so great that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:
<div class="bookquote">``what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another
carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken
suspicion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My opinion, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``is as you're right. Likewise
wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Pross, wildly crying, <div class="bookquote">``that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are
_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``I
hope so. Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o'
mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o'
two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
crisis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for gracious sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, <div class="bookquote">``record
them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``First,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage, <div class="bookquote">``them poor things well out o' this, never no
more will I do it, never no more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``that you
never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>returned Jerry, <div class="bookquote">``it shall not be named to you. Second: them
poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with
Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jerry/Young Jerry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross,
striving to dry her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes and compose herself, <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt it
is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) own
superintendence.--O my poor darlings!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--<div class="bookquote">``and let my words
be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my
opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only
hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there, there! I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) is, my dear man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>cried the distracted
Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) finds it answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) expectations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forbid it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,
additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out, <div class="bookquote">``as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn't all
flop -LRB-if it was anyways conwenient-RRB- to get `em out o' this here dismal
risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>This was Mr. Cruncher's
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.

<p/>And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we ever get back to our native land,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``you may rely
upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events
you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.
Cruncher, let us think!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) way along the streets, came nearer
and nearer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were to go before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and stop the vehicle and
horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't
that be best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where could you wait for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Pross.

<p/>Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) could think of no locality but
Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame
Defarge was drawing very near indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the cathedral door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross. <div class="bookquote">``Would it be much out of
the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two
towers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Cruncher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, like the best of men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``go to the posting-house
straight, and make that change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am doubtful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head,
<div class="bookquote">``about leaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven knows we don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``but have no fear for me.
Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o’Clock, or as near it as you can,
and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain
of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives
that may depend on both of us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>), decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)
immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) by herself
to follow as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had proposed.

<p/>The having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets, was another relief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) watch, and it was twenty
minutes past two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.

<p/>Afraid, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes,
which were swollen and red. Haunted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) feverish apprehensions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
could not bear to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>). In one of those pauses she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) recoiled and cried
out, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) saw a figure standing in the room.

<p/>The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of
Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,
those feet had come to meet that water.

<p/>Madame Defarge looked coldly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``The wife of Evremonde;
where is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open,
and would suggest the flight. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) first act was to shut them. There were
four in the room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) shut them all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.

<p/>Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) through this rapid movement,
and rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>); years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) appearance; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) too was a determined woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) different
way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) measured Madame Defarge with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes, every inch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Pross, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) breathing. <div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of
me. I am an Englishwoman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Defarge looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) scornfully, but still with something of
Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) saw a tight,
hard, wiry woman before her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew full well that
Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well
that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On my way yonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hand towards the fatal spot, <div class="bookquote">``where they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) in passing. I
wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that your intentions are evil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and you may
depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Each spoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own language; neither understood the other's words;
both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what
the unintelligible words meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will do her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Good patriots will know what that means.
Let me see her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>). Go tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) that I wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>). Do you hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and I
was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me. No,
you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) so far understood them as to perceive that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was set
at naught.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Woman imbecile and pig-like!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``I take no
answer from you. I demand to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>). Either tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) that I demand
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>), or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This, with an angry explanatory wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) right arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I little thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``that I should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,
except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any
part of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes. Madame
Defarge had not moved from the spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) stood when Miss Pross
first became aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>); but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) now advanced one step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a Briton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``I am desperate. I don't care an
English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the
greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I'll not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head and a flash of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes
between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) life.

<p/>But, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes. This was a courage that Madame
Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. <div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
laughed, <div class="bookquote">``you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that
Doctor.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) voice and called out, <div class="bookquote">``Citizen Doctor! Wife
of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool,
answer the Citizeness Defarge!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.
Three of the doors she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) opened swiftly, and looked in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there
are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind
you! Let me look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as
Madame Defarge understood the answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and
brought back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge to herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are
uncertain what to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross to herself; <div class="bookquote">``and you shall not
know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know
that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said
Madame Defarge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are
not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,
while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
my darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.

<p/>Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the
moment, seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) round the waist in both her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) arms, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) tight.
It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,
with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,
clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) tight, and even lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) from the floor in the struggle
that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
face; but, Miss Pross, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head down, held her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) round the waist, and
clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) with more than the hold of a drowning woman.

<p/>Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) encircled
waist. <div class="bookquote">``It is under my arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, <div class="bookquote">``you
shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Defarge's hands were at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw
what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
alone--blinded with smoke.

<p/>All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground.

<p/>In the first fright and horror of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) situation, Miss Pross passed the
body as far from it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) could, and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help. Happily, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bethought herself of the consequences of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to
go in at the door again; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) did go in, and even went near it, to
get the bonnet and other things that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) must wear. These she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) put on,
out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.

<p/>By good fortune she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had a veil on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bonnet, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) could hardly have
gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
like any other woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) needed both advantages, for the marks of
gripping fingers were deep in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was torn, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
dress -LRB-hastily composed with unsteady hands-RRB- was clutched and dragged a
hundred ways.

<p/>In crossing the bridge, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dropped the door key in the river. Arriving
at the cathedral some few minutes before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) escort, and waiting there,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if
it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains
discovered, what if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and
charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the
escort appeared, took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any noise in the streets?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>escort</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The usual noises,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the
question and by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aspect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't hear you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross. <div class="bookquote">``What do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) said; Miss Pross could
not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``So I'll nod my head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, <div class="bookquote">``at
all events she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll see that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any noise in the streets now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Pross again,
presently.

<p/>Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone deaf in an hour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) mind
much disturbed; <div class="bookquote">``wot's come to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``as if there had been a flash and a crash,
and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blest if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ain't in a queer condition!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, more and
more disturbed. <div class="bookquote">``Wot can she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) have been a takin', to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) courage up?
Hark! There's the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``nothing. O,
my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their
journey's end,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``it's my
opinion that indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never will hear anything else in this world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry Cruncher/Mr. Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>And indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) never did.




<p/>XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever


<p/>Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six
tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and
insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,
are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in
France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,
a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under
conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush
humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will
twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of
rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield
the same fruit according to its kind.

<p/>Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what
they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the
toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's
house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!
No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
of the Creator, never reverses his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) transformations. <div class="bookquote">``If thou be changed
into this shape by the will of God,''  (<font color='red'><b>the seers</b></font>)</div>say the seers to the enchanted, in
the wise Arabian stories, <div class="bookquote">``then remain so! But, if thou wear this
form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the seers</b></font>)</div>Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.

<p/>As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up
a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces
are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.
So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that
in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the
hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in
the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) points his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) finger, with something of the complacency of a
curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to
tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.

<p/>Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with
drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,
and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>) a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made
drunk by horror, that he (<font color='blue'><b>riders</b></font>) sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole
number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.

<p/>There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,
and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some
question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is
always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The
horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with
their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stands
at the back of the tumbril with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head bent down, to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
no curiosity or care for the scene about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and always speaks to the
girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised
against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If they move him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair a little more loosely about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot easily
touch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms being bound.

<p/>On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands
the Spy and prison-sheep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) looks into the first of them: not there.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) looks into the second: not there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) already asks himself, <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
sacrificed me?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>when his (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) face clears, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) looks into the third.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is Evremonde?''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>says a man behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That. At the back there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand in the girl's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man cries, <div class="bookquote">``Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!
Down, Evremonde!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Spy</b></font>)</div>the Spy entreats him (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>), timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not, citizen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
Let him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) be at peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man Down</b></font>)</div><p/>But the man continuing to exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``Down, Evremonde!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man Down</b></font>)</div>the face of
Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Evremonde then sees the
Spy, and looks attentively at him (<font color='blue'><b>Evremonde</b></font>), and goes his (<font color='blue'><b>Evremonde</b></font>) way.

<p/>The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the
populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and
end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and
close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following
to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of
public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the
fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Therese!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) cries, in her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) shrill tones. <div class="bookquote">``Who has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>)? Therese
Defarge!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>) never missed before,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; nor will she (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>) miss now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries The Vengeance, petulantly. <div class="bookquote">``Therese.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Louder,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman recommends.

<p/>Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will scarcely hear
thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet
it will hardly bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Send other women up and down to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread
deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad Fortune!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries The Vengeance, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) foot in the chair, <div class="bookquote">``and
here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>) not here! See her (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>) knitting in my hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>) empty chair ready for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>). I cry with vexation and disappointment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>As The Vengeance descends from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) elevation to do it, the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are
robed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who
scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
think and speak, count One.

<p/>The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!--And
the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.

<p/>The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next
after him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) has not relinquished her (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>) patient hand in getting out, but
still holds it as he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) promised. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gently places her (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>) back to the
crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>) looks into
his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) face and thanks him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am
naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been
able to raise my thoughts to Him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) who was put to death, that we might
have hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by
Heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or you to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Sydney Carton. <div class="bookquote">``Keep your eyes upon me, dear child,
and mind no other object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let
it go, if they are rapid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will be rapid. Fear not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>victims</b></font>)</div><p/>The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as
if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to
heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart
and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home
together, and to rest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) bosom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I
am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I
love very dearly. She (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is five years younger than I, and she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lives in a
farmer's house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knows
nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)! It is better as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes: better as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still

live a long time: she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may even live to be old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then, my gentle sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think:''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:

The spare hand does not tremble as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) releases it; nothing worse than
a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) goes next before
him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) that believeth

Twenty-Three.

<p/>They said of him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), about the city that night, that it was the

sublime and prophetic.

<p/>One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked
at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to
write down the thoughts that were inspiring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given any
utterance to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and they were prophetic, they would have been these:

<p/>``I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge,
long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of
the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease
out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in
their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil
of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural
birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.

<p/>``I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful,
prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see
Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with a child upon her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bosom, who bears my name. I see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father,
aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their
friend, in ten years' time enriching them with all he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has, and passing
tranquilly to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reward.

<p/>``I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of
their descendants, generations hence. I see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), an old woman, weeping
for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, their
course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know
that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul,
than I was in the souls of both.

<p/>``I see that child who lay upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom and who bore my name, a man
winning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name,
with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--then fair to
look upon, with not a trace of this day's disfigurement--and I hear him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.
