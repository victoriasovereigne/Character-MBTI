<p/>UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE
or
THE MELLSTOCK QUIRE
A RURAL PAINTING OF THE DUTCH SCHOOL
by Thomas Hardy


<p/>PREFACE


<p/>This story of the Mellstock Quire and its old established west-gallery
musicians, with some supplementary descriptions of similar officials in
Two on a Tower, A Few Crusted Characters, and other places, is intended
to be a fairly true picture, at first hand, of the personages, ways, and
customs which were common among such orchestral bodies in the villages of
fifty or sixty years ago.

<p/>One is inclined to regret the displacement of these ecclesiastical
bandsmen by an isolated organist -LRB-often at first a barrel-organist-RRB- or
harmonium player; and despite certain advantages in point of control and
accomplishment which were, no doubt, secured by installing the single
artist, the change has tended to stultify the professed aims of the
clergy, its direct result being to curtail and extinguish the interest of
parishioners in church doings. Under the old plan, from half a dozen to
ten full-grown players, in addition to the numerous more or less grown-up
singers, were officially occupied with the Sunday routine, and concerned
in trying their best to make it an artistic outcome of the combined
musical taste of the congregation. With a musical executive limited, as
it mostly is limited now, to the parson's wife or daughter and the school-
children, or to the school-teacher and the children, an important union
of interests has disappeared.

<p/>The zest of these bygone instrumentalists must have been keen and staying
to take them, as it did, on foot every Sunday after a toilsome week,
through all weathers, to the church, which often lay at a distance from
their homes. They usually received so little in payment for their
performances that their efforts were really a labour of love. In the
parish I had in my mind when writing the present tale, the gratuities
received yearly by the musicians at Christmas were somewhat as follows:
From the manor-house ten shillings and a supper; from the vicar ten
shillings; from the farmers five shillings each; from each
cottage-household one shilling; amounting altogether to not more than ten
shillings a head annually--just enough, as an old executant told me, to
pay for their fiddle-strings, repairs, rosin, and music-paper -LRB-which they
mostly ruled themselves-RRB-. Their music in those days was all in their own
manuscript, copied in the evenings after work, and their music-books were
home-bound.

<p/>It was customary to inscribe a few jigs, reels, horn-pipes, and ballads
in the same book, by beginning it at the other end, the insertions being
continued from front and back till sacred and secular met together in the
middle, often with bizarre effect, the words of some of the songs
exhibiting that ancient and broad humour which our grandfathers, and
possibly grandmothers, took delight in, and is in these days unquotable.

<p/>The aforesaid fiddle-strings, rosin, and music-paper were supplied by a
pedlar, who travelled exclusively in such wares from parish to parish,
coming to each village about every six months. Tales are told of the
consternation once caused among the church fiddlers when, on the occasion
of their producing a new Christmas anthem, he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) did not come to time, owing
to being snowed up on the downs, and the straits they were in through
having to make shift with whipcord and twine for strings. He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was
generally a musician himself, and sometimes a composer in a small way,
bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) own new tunes, and tempting each choir to adopt them for a
consideration. Some of these compositions which now lie before me, with
their repetitions of lines, half-lines, and half-words, their fugues and
their intermediate symphonies, are good singing still, though they would
hardly be admitted into such hymn-books as are popular in the churches of
fashionable society at the present time.

<p/>August 1896.

<p/>Under the Greenwood Tree was first brought out in the summer of 1872 in
two volumes. The name of the story was originally intended to be, more
appropriately, The Mellstock Quire, and this has been appended as a sub-
title since the early editions, it having been thought unadvisable to
displace for it the title by which the book first became known.

<p/>In rereading the narrative after a long interval there occurs the
inevitable reflection that the realities out of which it was spun were
material for another kind of study of this little group of church
musicians than is found in the chapters here penned so lightly, even so
farcically and flippantly at times. But circumstances would have
rendered any aim at a deeper, more essential, more transcendent handling
unadvisable at the date of writing; and the exhibition of the Mellstock
Quire in the following pages must remain the only extant one, except for
the few glimpses of that perished band which I have given in verse
elsewhere.

<p/>PART THE FIRST--WINTER


<p/>CHAPTER I: MELLSTOCK-LANE


<p/>To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree has its voice as well
as its feature. At the passing of the breeze the fir-trees sob and moan
no less distinctly than they rock; the holly whistles as it battles with
itself; the ash hisses amid its quiverings; the beech rustles while its
flat boughs rise and fall. And winter, which modifies the note of such
trees as shed their leaves, does not destroy its individuality.

<p/>On a cold and starry Christmas-eve within living memory a man was passing
up a lane towards Mellstock Cross in the darkness of a plantation that
whispered thus distinctively to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intelligence. All the evidences of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature were those afforded by the spirit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) footsteps, which
succeeded each other lightly and quickly, and by the liveliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sang in a rural cadence:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With the rose and the lily
And the daffodowndilly,
The lads and the lasses a-sheep-shearing go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The lonely lane he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was following connected one of the hamlets of
Mellstock parish with Upper Mellstock and Lewgate, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes,
casually glancing upward, the silver and black-stemmed birches with their
characteristic tufts, the pale grey boughs of beech, the dark-creviced
elm, all appeared now as black and flat outlines upon the sky, wherein
the white stars twinkled so vehemently that their flickering seemed like
the flapping of wings. Within the woody pass, at a level anything lower
than the horizon, all was dark as the grave. The copse-wood forming the
sides of the bower interlaced its branches so densely, even at this
season of the year, that the draught from the north-east flew along the
channel with scarcely an interruption from lateral breezes.

<p/>After passing the plantation and reaching Mellstock Cross the white
surface of the lane revealed itself between the dark hedgerows like a
ribbon jagged at the edges; the irregularity being caused by temporary
accumulations of leaves extending from the ditch on either side.

<p/>The song -LRB-many times interrupted by flitting thoughts which took the
place of several bars, and resumed at a point it would have reached had
its continuity been unbroken-RRB- now received a more palpable check, in the
shape of <div class="bookquote">``Ho-i-i-i-i-i!''  (<font color='red'><b>the singer</b></font>)</div>from the crossing lane to Lower Mellstock, on
the right of the singer who had just emerged from the trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho-i-i-i-i-i!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) answered, stopping and looking round, though with no
idea of seeing anything more than imagination pictured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that thee, young Dick Dewy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came from the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sure, Michael Mail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why not stop for fellow-craters--going to thy own father's house
too, as we be, and knowen us so well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick Dewy faced about and continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) tune in an under-whistle,
implying that the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) mouth could not be checked at a
moment's notice by the placid emotion of friendship.

<p/>Having come more into the open he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) could now be seen rising against the
sky, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) profile appearing on the light background like the portrait of a
gentleman in black cardboard. It assumed the form of a low-crowned hat,
an ordinary-shaped nose, an ordinary chin, an ordinary neck, and ordinary
shoulders. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) consisted of further down was invisible from lack of
sky low enough to picture him (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) on.

<p/>Shuffling, halting, irregular footsteps of various kinds were now heard
coming up the hill, and presently there emerged from the shade severally
five men of different ages and gaits, all of them working villagers of
the parish of Mellstock. They, too, had lost their rotundity with the
daylight, and advanced against the sky in flat outlines, which suggested
some processional design on Greek or Etruscan pottery. They represented
the chief portion of Mellstock parish choir.

<p/>The first was a bowed and bent man, who carried a fiddle under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm,
and walked as if engaged in studying some subject connected with the
surface of the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Michael Mail, the man who had hallooed to
Dick.

<p/>The next was Mr. Robert Penny, boot- and shoemaker; a little man, who,
though rather round-shouldered, walked as if that fact had not come to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own knowledge, moving on with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back very hollow and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face fixed
on the north-east quarter of the heavens before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lower
waist-coat-buttons came first, and then the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
features were invisible; yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) occasionally looked round, two faint
moons of light gleamed for an instant from the precincts of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes,
denoting that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore spectacles of a circular form.

<p/>The third was Elias Spinks, who walked perpendicularly and dramatically.
The fourth outline was Joseph Bowman's, who had now no distinctive
appearance beyond that of a human being. Finally came a weak lath-like
form, trotting and stumbling along with one shoulder forward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) head
inclined to the left, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) arms dangling nervelessly in the wind as if
they were empty sleeves. This was Thomas Leaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where be the boys?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick to this somewhat indifferently-matched
assembly.

<p/>The eldest of the group, Michael Mail, cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) throat from a great
depth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We told them to keep back at home for a time, thinken they wouldn't be
wanted yet awhile; and we could choose the tuens, and so on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father and grandfather William have expected ye a little sooner. I have
just been for a run round by Ewelease Stile and Hollow Hill to warm my
feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure father did! To be sure 'a did expect us--to taste the little
barrel beyond compare that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s going to tap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Od rabbit it all! Never heard a word of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny, gleams of
delight appearing upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) spectacle-glasses, Dick meanwhile singing
parenthetically--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lads and the lasses a-sheep-shearing go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neighbours, there's time enough to drink a sight of drink now afore
bedtime?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True, true--time enough to get as drunk as lords!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>replied Bowman
cheerfully.

<p/>This opinion being taken as convincing they all advanced between the
varying hedges and the trees dotting them here and there, kicking their
toes occasionally among the crumpled leaves. Soon appeared glimmering
indications of the few cottages forming the small hamlet of Upper
Mellstock for which they were bound, whilst the faint sound of church-
bells ringing a Christmas peal could be heard floating over upon the
breeze from the direction of Longpuddle and Weatherbury parishes on the
other side of the hills. A little wicket admitted them to the garden,
and they proceeded up the path to Dick's house.



<p/>CHAPTER II: THE TRANTER``S


<p/>It was a long low cottage with a hipped roof of thatch, having dormer
windows breaking up into the eaves, a chimney standing in the middle of
the ridge and another at each end. The window-shutters were not yet
closed, and the fire- and candle-light within radiated forth upon the
thick bushes of box and laurestinus growing in clumps outside, and upon
the bare boughs of several codlin-trees hanging about in various
distorted shapes, the result of early training as espaliers combined with
careless climbing into their boughs in later years. The walls of the
dwelling were for the most part covered with creepers, though these were
rather beaten back from the doorway--a feature which was worn and
scratched by much passing in and out, giving it by day the appearance of
an old keyhole. Light streamed through the cracks and joints of
outbuildings a little way from the cottage, a sight which nourished a
fancy that the purpose of the erection must be rather to veil bright
attractions than to shelter unsightly necessaries. The noise of a beetle
and wedges and the splintering of wood was periodically heard from this
direction; and at some little distance further a steady regular munching
and the occasional scurr of a rope betokened a stable, and horses feeding
within it.

<p/>The choir stamped severally on the door-stone to shake from their boots
any fragment of earth or leaf adhering thereto, then entered the house
and looked around to survey the condition of things. Through the open
doorway of a small inner room on the right hand, of a character between
pantry and cellar, was Dick Dewy's father Reuben, by vocation a
<div class="bookquote">``tranter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>or irregular carrier. He (<font color='blue'><b>TRANTER</b></font>) was a stout florid man about forty
years of age, who surveyed people up and down when first making their
acquaintance, and generally smiled at the horizon or other distant object
during conversations with friends, walking about with a steady sway, and
turning out his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) toes very considerably. Being now occupied in bending
over a hogshead, that stood in the pantry ready horsed for the process of
broaching, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) did not take the trouble to turn or raise his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) eyes at the
entry of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) visitors, well knowing by their footsteps that they were the
expected old comrades.

<p/>The main room, on the left, was decked with bunches of holly and other
evergreens, and from the middle of the beam bisecting the ceiling hung
the mistletoe, of a size out of all proportion to the room, and extending
so low that it became necessary for a full-grown person to walk round it
in passing, or run the risk of entangling his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hair. This apartment
contained Mrs. Dewy the tranter's wife, and the four remaining children,
Susan, Jim, Bessy, and Charley, graduating uniformly though at wide
stages from the age of sixteen to that of four years--the eldest of the
series being separated from Dick the firstborn by a nearly equal
interval.

<p/>Some circumstance had apparently caused much grief to Charley just
previous to the entry of the choir, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had absently taken down a
small looking-glass, holding it before his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) face to learn how the human
countenance appeared when engaged in crying, which survey led him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) to
pause at the various points in each wail that were more than ordinarily
striking, for a thorough appreciation of the general effect. Bessy was
leaning against a chair, and glancing under the plaits about the waist of
the plaid frock she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wore, to notice the original unfaded pattern of the
material as there preserved, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face bearing an expression of regret
that the brightness had passed away from the visible portions. Mrs. Dewy
sat in a brown settle by the side of the glowing wood fire--so glowing
that with a heedful compression of the lips she (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) would now and then rise
and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) hand upon the hams and flitches of bacon lining the chimney,
to reassure herself that they were not being broiled instead of smoked--a
misfortune that had been known to happen now and then at Christmas-time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, my sonnies, here you be, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben Dewy at length,
standing up and blowing forth a vehement gust of breath. <div class="bookquote">``How the blood
do puff up in anybody's head, to be sure, a-stooping like that! I was
just going out to gate to hark for ye.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) then carefully began to wind
a strip of brown paper round a brass tap he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``This in
the cask here is a drop o' the right sort''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-tapping the cask-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">''`tis a
real drop o' cordial from the best picked apples--Sansoms, Stubbards,
Five-corners, and such-like--you d'mind the sort, Michael?''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Michael
nodded.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``And there's a sprinkling of they that grow down by the orchard-
rails--streaked ones--rail apples we d'call 'em, as `tis by the rails
they grow, and not knowing the right name. The water-cider from 'em is
as good as most people's best cider is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and of the same make too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Bowman. <div class="bookquote">''`It rained when we wrung
it out, and the water got into it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>folk will say. But `tis on'y an
excuse. Watered cider is too common among us.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; too common it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elias Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Spinks with an inward sigh, whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>)
eyes seemed to be looking at the case in an abstract form rather than at
the scene before him (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Such poor liquor do make a man's throat feel very
melancholy--and is a disgrace to the name of stimmilent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, come in, and draw up to the fire; never mind your shoes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Dewy, seeing that all except Dick had paused to wipe them upon the
door-mat. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad that you've stepped up-along at last; and, Susan,
you run down to Grammer Kaytes's and see if you can borrow some larger
candles than these fourteens. Tommy Leaf, don't ye be afeard! Come and
sit here in the settle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>This was addressed to the young man before mentioned, consisting chiefly
of a human skeleton and a smock-frock, who was very awkward in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
movements, apparently on account of having grown so very fast that before
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had time to get used to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) height he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was higher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hee--hee--ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>replied Leaf, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth continue to smile for
some time after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind had done smiling, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth remained in
view as the most conspicuous members of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Mr. Penny,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>resumed Mrs. Dewy, <div class="bookquote">``you sit in this chair. And how's
your daughter, Mrs. Brownjohn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose I must say pretty fair.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adjusted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spectacles a
quarter of an inch to the right. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'ll be worse before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s
better, 'a b`lieve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed--poor soul! And how many will that make in all, four or five?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five; they've buried three. Yes, five; and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) not much more than a
maid yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) do know the multiplication table onmistakable well.
However, 'twas to be, and none can gainsay it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dewy resigned Mr. Penny. <div class="bookquote">``Wonder where your grandfather James is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) inquired of one of the children. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'d drop in to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out in fuel-house with grandfather William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jimmy</b></font>)</div>said Jimmy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let's see what we can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was heard spoken about this time by the
tranter in a private voice to the barrel, beside which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) had again
established himself, and was stooping to cut away the cork.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Reuben, don't make such a mess o' tapping that barrel as is mostly made
in this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dewy</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dewy cried from the fireplace. <div class="bookquote">``I'd tap a hundred
without wasting more than you do in one. Such a squizzling and squirting
job as `tis in your hands! There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) always was such a clumsy man
indoors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ay, ay; I know you'd tap a hundred beautiful, Ann--I know you would; two
hundred, perhaps. But I can't promise. This is a' old cask, and the
wood's rotted away about the tap-hole. The husbird of a feller Sam
Lawson--that ever I should call'n such, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawson</b></font>)'s dead and gone, poor
heart!--took me in completely upon the feat of buying this cask. ``Reub,''
says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>)--'a always used to call me plain Reub, poor old heart!--``Reub,''
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) said, says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>), `that there cask, Reub, is as good as new; yes, good as

be deceived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reub</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's as true as gospel of this member,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben.

<p/>Mrs. Dewy began a smile at the answer, then altering her (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) lips and
refolding them so that it was not a smile, commenced smoothing little
Bessy's hair; the tranter having meanwhile suddenly become oblivious to
conversation, occupying himself in a deliberate cutting and arrangement
of some more brown paper for the broaching operation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, who can believe sellers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said old Michael Mail in a
carefully-cautious voice, by way of tiding-over this critical point of
affairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Joseph Bowman, in the tone of a man fully agreeing
with everybody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said Mail, in the tone of a man who did not agree with everybody as
a rule, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did now; <div class="bookquote">``I knowed a' auctioneering feller once--a very
friendly feller 'a was too. And so one hot day as I was walking down the
front street o' Casterbridge, jist below the King's Arms, I passed a'
open winder and see him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) inside, stuck upon his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) perch, a-selling off. I
jist nodded to en in a friendly way as I passed, and went my way, and
thought no more about it. Well, next day, as I was oilen my boots by
fuel-house door, if a letter didn't come wi' a bill charging me with a
feather-bed, bolster, and pillers, that I had bid for at Mr. Taylor's
sale. The slim-faced martel had knocked 'em down to me because I nodded
to en in my friendly way; and I had to pay for 'em too. Now, I hold that
that was coming it very close, Reuben?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'''Twas close, there's no denying,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the general voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too close, 'twas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben, in the rear of the rest. <div class="bookquote">``And as to Sam
Lawson--poor heart! now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawson</b></font>)'s dead and gone too!--I'll warrant, that if so
be I've spent one hour in making hoops for that barrel, I've spent fifty,
first and last. That's one of my hoops'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--touching it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>)
elbow--<div class="bookquote">``that's one of mine, and that, and that, and all these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Sam was a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny, contemplatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam was!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Bowman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially for a drap o' drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good, but not religious-good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Penny.

<p/>The tranter nodded. Having at last made the tap and hole quite ready,
<div class="bookquote">``Now then, Suze, bring a mug,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Here's luck to us, my sonnies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/>The tap went in, and the cider immediately squirted out in a horizontal
shower over Reuben's hands, knees, and leggings, and into the eyes and
neck of Charley, who, having temporarily put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) grief under pressure
of more interesting proceedings, was squatting down and blinking near his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There `tis again!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Devil take the hole, the cask, and Sam Lawson too, that good cider
should be wasted like this!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``Your thumb! Lend
me your thumb, Michael! Ram it in here, Michael! I must get a bigger
tap, my sonnies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Idd it cold inthide te hole?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>inquired Charley of Michael, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
continued in a stooping posture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) thumb in the cork-hole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What wonderful odds and ends that chiel has in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) head to be sure!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dewy admiringly exclaimed from the distance. <div class="bookquote">``I lay a wager that he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>)
thinks more about how `tis inside that barrel than in all the other parts
of the world put together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>All persons</b></font>)</div><p/>All persons present put on a speaking countenance of admiration for the
cleverness alluded to, in the midst of which Reuben returned. The
operation was then satisfactorily performed; when Michael arose and
stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) head to the extremest fraction of height that his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) body
would allow of, to re-straighten his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) back and shoulders--thrusting out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) arms and twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) features to a mass of wrinkles to emphasize the
relief aquired. A quart or two of the beverage was then brought to
table, at which all the new arrivals reseated themselves with wide-spread
knees, their eyes meditatively seeking out any speck or knot in the board
upon which the gaze might precipitate itself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever is father a-biding out in fuel-house so long for?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
tranter. ``Never such a man as father for two things--cleaving up old
dead apple-tree wood and playing the bass-viol. <div class="bookquote">``A'd pass his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life
between the two, that 'a would.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) stepped to the door and opened it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rang thinly from round the corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's the barrel tapped, and we all a-waiting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A series of dull thuds, that had been heard without for some time past,
now ceased; and after the light of a lantern had passed the window and
made wheeling rays upon the ceiling inside the eldest of the Dewy family
appeared.



<p/>CHAPTER III: THE ASSEMBLED QUIRE


<p/>William Dewy--otherwise grandfather William--was now about seventy; yet
an ardent vitality still preserved a warm and roughened bloom upon his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
face, which reminded gardeners of the sunny side of a ripe
ribstone-pippin; though a narrow strip of forehead, that was protected
from the weather by lying above the line of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hat-brim, seemed to
belong to some town man, so gentlemanly was its whiteness. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was a
humorous and kindly nature, not unmixed with a frequent melancholy; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had a firm religious faith. But to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) neighbours he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had no character
in particular. If they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pass by their windows when they had been
bottling off old mead, or when they had just been called long-headed men
who might do anything in the world if they chose, they thought concerning
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Ah, there's that good-hearted man--open as a child!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>If they saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) just after losing a shilling or half-a-crown, or accidentally letting
fall a piece of crockery, they thought, <div class="bookquote">``There's that poor weak-minded
man Dewy again! Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s never done much in the world either!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>If he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
passed when fortune neither smiled nor frowned on them, they merely
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) old William Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, so's--here you be!--Ah, Michael and Joseph and John--and you too,
Leaf! a merry Christmas all! We shall have a rare log-wood fire
directly, Reub, to reckon by the toughness of the job I had in cleaving
'em.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) threw down an armful of logs which fell in the
chimney-corner with a rumble, and looked at them with something of the
admiring enmity he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) would have bestowed on living people who had been very
obstinate in holding their own. <div class="bookquote">``Come in, grandfather James.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div><p/>Old James -LRB-grandfather on the maternal side-RRB- had simply called as a
visitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) lived in a cottage by himself, and many people considered
him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) a miser; some, rather slovenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) habits. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) now came forward
from behind grandfather William, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stooping figure formed a well-
illuminated picture as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) passed towards the fire-place. Being by trade
a mason, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wore a long linen apron reaching almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) toes, corduroy
breeches and gaiters, which, together with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boots, graduated in tints
of whitish-brown by constant friction against lime and stone. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) also
wore a very stiff fustian coat, having folds at the elbows and shoulders
as unvarying in their arrangement as those in a pair of bellows: the
ridges and the projecting parts of the coat collectively exhibiting a
shade different from that of the hollows, which were lined with small
ditch-like accumulations of stone and mortar-dust. The extremely large
side-pockets, sheltered beneath wide flaps, bulged out convexly whether
empty or full; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was often engaged to work at buildings far
away--his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) breakfasts and dinners being eaten in a strange chimney-corner,
by a garden wall, on a heap of stones, or walking along the road--he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
carried in these pockets a small tin canister of butter, a small canister
of sugar, a small canister of tea, a paper of salt, and a paper of
pepper; the bread, cheese, and meat, forming the substance of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) meals,
hanging up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) basket among the hammers and chisels. If a
passer-by looked hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) was drawing forth any of these, <div class="bookquote">``My
buttery,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) said, with a pinched smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better try over number seventy-eight before we start, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said
William, pointing to a heap of old Christmas-carol books on a side table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wi' all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the choir generally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Number seventy-eight was always a teaser--always. I can mind him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) ever
since I was growing up a hard boy-chap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s a good tune, and worth a mint o' practice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is; though I've been mad enough wi' that tune at times to seize en
and tear en all to linnit. Ay, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s a splendid carrel--there's no
denying that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The first line is well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Spinks; ``but when you come to
``O, thou man,<div class="bookquote">'' you make a mess o`t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll have another go into en, and see what we can make of the martel.
Half-an-hour's hammering at en will conquer the toughness of en; I'll
warn it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Od rabbit it all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny, interrupting with a flash of his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>)
spectacles, and at the same time clawing at something in the depths of a
large side-pocket. <div class="bookquote">``If so be I hadn't been as scatter-brained and
thirtingill as a chiel, I should have called at the schoolhouse wi' a
boot as I cam up along. Whatever is coming to me I really can't estimate
at all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The brain has its weaknesses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>murmured Mr. Spinks, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) head
ominously. Mr. Spinks was considered to be a scholar, having once kept a
night-school, and always spoke up to that level.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must call with en the first thing to-morrow. And I'll empt my
pocket o' this last too, if you don't mind, Mrs. Dewy.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) drew forth a
last, and placed it on a table at his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) elbow. The eyes of three or four
followed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the shoemaker</b></font>)</div>said the shoemaker, seeming to perceive that the interest the
object had excited was greater than he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) had anticipated, and warranted the
last's being taken up again and exhibited; <div class="bookquote">``now, whose foot do ye suppose
this last was made for? It was made for Geoffrey Day's father, over at
Yalbury Wood. Ah, many's the pair o' boots he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)'ve had off the last! Well,
when 'a died, I used the last for Geoffrey, and have ever since, though a
little doctoring was wanted to make it do. Yes, a very queer natured
last it is now, 'a b`lieve,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) continued, turning it over caressingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, you notice that there''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to a lump of leather bradded to
the toe-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``that's a very bad bunion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)'ve had ever since 'a was a
boy. Now, this remarkable large piece''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to a patch nailed to
the side-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``shows a' accident he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) received by the tread of a horse, that
squashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) foot a`most to a pomace. The horseshoe cam full-butt on
this point, you see. And so I've just been over to Geoffrey's, to know
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) bunion altered or made bigger in the new pair I'm
making.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div><p/>During the latter part of this speech, Mr. Penny's left hand wandered
towards the cider-cup, as if the hand had no connection with the person
speaking; and bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) sentence to an abrupt close, all but the
extreme margin of the bootmaker's face was eclipsed by the circular brim
of the vessel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, I was going to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Penny</b></font>)</div>continued Penny, putting down the cup, <div class="bookquote">``I
ought to have called at the school'' (<font color='red'><b>Penny</b></font>)</div>--here he (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) went groping again in the
depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) pocket--<div class="bookquote">``to leave this without fail, though I suppose the
first thing to-morrow will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) now drew forth and placed upon the table a boot--small, light, and
prettily shaped--upon the heel of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) had been operating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The new schoolmistress's!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, no less, Miss Fancy Day; as neat a little figure of fun as ever I
see, and just husband-high.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never Geoffrey's daughter Fancy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Bowman, as all glances present
converged like wheel-spokes upon the boot in the centre of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>resumed Mr. Penny, regarding the boot as if that alone were
his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) auditor; <div class="bookquote">''`tis she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) that's come here schoolmistress. You knowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>)
daughter was in training?''

 (<font color='red'><b>auditor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strange, isn't it, for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to be here Christmas night, Master Penny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but here she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is, 'a b`lieve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know how she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) comes here--so I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>chirruped one of the children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>Dick inquired, with subtle interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pa`son Maybold was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) couldn't manage us all to-morrow at the
dinner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) talked o' getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) jist to come over and help him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand
about the plates, and see we didn't make pigs of ourselves; and that's
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)'s come for!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's the boot, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued its mender imaginatively, <div class="bookquote">``that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)'ll walk to church in to-morrow morning. I don't care to mend boots I
don't make; but there's no knowing what it may lead to, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) father
always comes to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There, between the cider-mug and the candle, stood this interesting
receptacle of the little unknown's foot; and a very pretty boot it was. A
character, in fact--the flexible bend at the instep, the rounded
localities of the small nestling toes, scratches from careless scampers
now forgotten--all, as repeated in the tell-tale leather, evidencing a
nature and a bias. Dick surveyed it with a delicate feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had
no right to do so without having first asked the owner of the foot's
permission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, neighbours, though no common eye can see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the shoemaker</b></font>)</div>the shoemaker went
on, <div class="bookquote">``a man in the trade can see the likeness between this boot and that
last, although that is so deformed as hardly to recall one of God's
creatures, and this is one of as pretty a pair as you'd get for ten-and-
sixpence in Casterbridge. To you, nothing; but `tis father's voot and
daughter's voot to me, as plain as houses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shoemaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't doubt there's a likeness, Master Penny--a mild likeness--a
fantastical likeness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Spinks. <div class="bookquote">``But I han't got imagination enough
to see it, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Penny adjusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) spectacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I'll tell ye what happened to me once on this very point. You used
to know Johnson the dairyman, William?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sure; I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, 'twasn't opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) house, but a little lower down--by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
paddock, in front o' Parkmaze Pool. I was a-bearing across towards
Bloom's End, and lo and behold, there was a man just brought out o' the
Pool, dead; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had un`rayed for a dip, but not being able to pitch it
just there had gone in flop over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. Men looked at en; women
looked at en; children looked at en; nobody knowed en. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was covered
wi' a sheet; but I catched sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voot, just showing out as they
carried en along. ``I don't care what name that man went by,<div class="bookquote">'' I said, in
my way, `but he (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>)'s John Woodward's brother; I can swear to the family
voot.''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>At that very moment up comes John Woodward, weeping and teaving,
<div class="bookquote">``I've lost my brother! I've lost my brother!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Woodward/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only to think of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis well enough to know this foot and that foot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Spinks.
<div class="bookquote">''`Tis long-headed, in fact, as far as feet do go. I know little, `tis
true--I say no more; but show me a man's foot, and I'll tell you that
man's heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be a cleverer feller, then, than mankind in jineral,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
tranter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's nothing for me to speak of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Spinks. <div class="bookquote">``A man
lives and learns. Maybe I've read a leaf or two in my time. I don't
wish to say anything large, mind you; but nevertheless, maybe I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``and all the parish knows, that
ye've read sommat of everything a`most, and have been a great filler of
young folks' brains. Learning's a worthy thing, and ye've got it, Master
Spinks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I make no boast, though I may have read and thought a little; and I
know--it may be from much perusing, but I make no boast--that by the time
a man's head is finished, `tis almost time for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to creep underground.
I am over forty-five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Spinks emitted a look to signify that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) head was not finished,
nobody's head ever could be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Talk of knowing people by their feet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben. <div class="bookquote">``Rot me, my
sonnies, then, if I can tell what a man is from all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) members put
together, oftentimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But still, look is a good deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>observed grandfather William absently,
moving and balancing his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) head till the tip of grandfather James's nose
was exactly in a right line with William's eye and the mouth of a
miniature cavern he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was discerning in the fire. <div class="bookquote">``By the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
continued in a fresher voice, and looking up, <div class="bookquote">``that young crater, the

fine as her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) face, we shall have enough to do to be up-sides with her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) face?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said young Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>Mr. Spinks replied, <div class="bookquote">''`tis a face you can hardly
gainsay. A very good pink face, as far as that do go. Still, only a
face, when all is said and done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Elias Spinks, say she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s a pretty maid, and have done wi'
her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, again preparing to visit the cider-barrel.



<p/>CHAPTER IV: GOING THE ROUNDS


<p/>Shortly after ten o'clock the singing-boys arrived at the tranter's
house, which was invariably the place of meeting, and preparations were
made for the start. The older men and musicians wore thick coats, with
stiff perpendicular collars, and coloured handkerchiefs wound round and
round the neck till the end came to hand, over all which they just showed
their ears and noses, like people looking over a wall. The remainder,
stalwart ruddy men and boys, were dressed mainly in snow-white
smock-frocks, embroidered upon the shoulders and breasts, in ornamental
forms of hearts, diamonds, and zigzags. The cider-mug was emptied for
the ninth time, the music-books were arranged, and the pieces finally
decided upon. The boys in the meantime put the old horn-lanterns in
order, cut candles into short lengths to fit the lanterns; and, a thin
fleece of snow having fallen since the early part of the evening, those
who had no leggings went to the stable and wound wisps of hay round their
ankles to keep the insidious flakes from the interior of their boots.

<p/>Mellstock was a parish of considerable acreage, the hamlets composing it
lying at a much greater distance from each other than is ordinarily the
case. Hence several hours were consumed in playing and singing within
hearing of every family, even if but a single air were bestowed on each.
There was Lower Mellstock, the main village; half a mile from this were
the church and vicarage, and a few other houses, the spot being rather
lonely now, though in past centuries it had been the most
thickly-populated quarter of the parish. A mile north-east lay the
hamlet of Upper Mellstock, where the tranter lived; and at other points
knots of cottages, besides solitary farmsteads and dairies.

<p/>Old William Dewy, with the violoncello, played the bass; his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) grandson
Dick the treble violin; and Reuben and Michael Mail the tenor and second
violins respectively. The singers consisted of four men and seven boys,
upon whom devolved the task of carrying and attending to the lanterns,
and holding the books open for the players. Directly music was the
theme, old William ever and instinctively came to the front.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now mind, neighbours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, as they all went out one by one at the
door, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) himself holding it ajar and regarding them with a critical face
as they passed, like a shepherd counting out his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) sheep. ``You two counter-
boys, keep your ears open to Michael's fingering, and don't ye go
straying into the treble part along o' Dick and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) set, as ye did last
year; and mind this especially when we be in ``Arise, and hail.<div class="bookquote">'' Billy
Chimlen, don't you sing quite so raving mad as you fain would; and, all
o' ye, whatever ye do, keep from making a great scuffle on the ground
when we go in at people's gates; but go quietly, so as to strike up all
of a sudden, like spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Farmer Ledlow's first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Farmer Ledlow's first; the rest as usual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, Voss,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter terminatively, <div class="bookquote">``you keep house here till
about half-past two; then heat the metheglin and cider in the warmer
you'll find turned up upon the copper; and bring it wi' the victuals to
church-hatch, as th`st know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>Just before the clock struck twelve they lighted the lanterns and
started. The moon, in her (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) third quarter, had risen since the snowstorm;
but the dense accumulation of snow-cloud weakened her (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) power to a faint
twilight, which was rather pervasive of the landscape than traceable to
the sky. The breeze had gone down, and the rustle of their feet and
tones of their speech echoed with an alert rebound from every post,
boundary-stone, and ancient wall they passed, even where the distance of
the echo's origin was less than a few yards. Beyond their own slight
noises nothing was to be heard, save the occasional bark of foxes in the
direction of Yalbury Wood, or the brush of a rabbit among the grass now
and then, as it scampered out of their way.

<p/>Most of the outlying homesteads and hamlets had been visited by about two
o'clock; they then passed across the outskirts of a wooded park toward
the main village, nobody being at home at the Manor. Pursuing no
recognized track, great care was necessary in walking lest their faces
should come in contact with the low-hanging boughs of the old lime-trees,
which in many spots formed dense over-growths of interlaced branches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Times have changed from the times they used to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>said Mail, regarding
nobody can tell what interesting old panoramas with an inward eye, and
letting his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) outward glance rest on the ground, because it was as
convenient a position as any. <div class="bookquote">``People don't care much about us now! I've
been thinking we must be almost the last left in the county of the old
string players? Barrel-organs, and the things next door to 'em that you
blow wi' your foot, have come in terribly of late years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Bowman, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) head; and old William, on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>), did
the same thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More's the pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied another. <div class="bookquote">``Time was--long and merry ago
now!--when not one of the varmits was to be heard of; but it served some
of the quires right. They should have stuck to strings as we did, and
kept out clarinets, and done away with serpents. If you'd thrive in
musical religion, stick to strings, says I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strings be safe soul-lifters, as far as that do go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Spinks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet there's worse things than serpents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny. <div class="bookquote">``Old things
pass away, `tis true; but a serpent was a good old note: a deep rich note
was the serpent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clar`nets, however, be bad at all times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael Mail. ``One
Christmas--years agone now, years--I went the rounds wi' the Weatherbury
quire. <div class="bookquote">``Twas a hard frosty night, and the keys of all the clar`nets
froze--ah, they did freeze!--so that 'twas like drawing a cork every time
a key was opened; and the players o' 'em had to go into a
hedger-and-ditcher's chimley-corner, and thaw their clar`nets every now
and then. An icicle o' spet hung down from the end of every man's
clar`net a span long; and as to fingers--well, there, if ye'll believe
me, we had no fingers at all, to our knowing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can well bring back to my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny, ``what I said to poor
Joseph Ryme -LRB-who took the treble part in Chalk-Newton Church for two-and-
forty year-RRB- when they thought of having clar`nets there. ``Joseph,'' I
said, says I, `depend upon't, if so be you have them tooting clar`nets
you'll spoil the whole set-out. Clar`nets were not made for the service
of the Lard; you can see it by looking at ``em,<div class="bookquote">'' I said. And what came
o`t? Why, souls, the parson set up a barrel-organ on his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) own account
within two years o' the time I spoke, and the old quire went to nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as look is concerned,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, ``I don't for my part see
that a fiddle is much nearer heaven than a clar`net. <div class="bookquote">``Tis further off.
There's always a rakish, scampish twist about a fiddle's looks that seems
to say the Wicked One had a hand in making o'en; while angels be supposed
to play clar`nets in heaven, or som`at like 'em, if ye may believe
picters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert Penny, you was in the right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>broke in the eldest Dewy. <div class="bookquote">``They
should ha' stuck to strings. Your brass-man is a rafting dog--well and
good; your reed-man is a dab at stirring ye--well and good; your drum-man
is a rare bowel-shaker--good again. But I don't care who hears me say
it, nothing will spak to your heart wi' the sweetness o' the man of
strings!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strings for ever!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jimmy</b></font>)</div>said little Jimmy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strings alone would have held their ground against all the new comers in
creation.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``True, true!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Bowman.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``But clarinets was death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Death they was!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``And harmonions,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>William continued
in a louder voice, and getting excited by these signs of approval,
<div class="bookquote">``harmonions and barrel-organs''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>and groans from Spinks-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``be
miserable--what shall I call 'em?--miserable--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sinners,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jimmy</b></font>)</div>suggested Jimmy, who made large strides like the men, and did
not lag behind like the other little boys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miserable dumbledores!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right, William, and so they be--miserable dumbledores!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the choir
with unanimity.

<p/>By this time they were crossing to a gate in the direction of the school,
which, standing on a slight eminence at the junction of three ways, now
rose in unvarying and dark flatness against the sky. The instruments
were retuned, and all the band entered the school enclosure, enjoined by
old William to keep upon the grass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Number seventy-eight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) softly gave out as they formed round in a
semicircle, the boys opening the lanterns to get a clearer light, and
directing their rays on the books.

<p/>Then passed forth into the quiet night an ancient and time-worn hymn,
embodying a quaint Christianity in words orally transmitted from father
to son through several generations down to the present characters, who
sang them out right earnestly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember Adam's fall,
O thou Man:
Remember Adam's fall
From Heaven to Hell.
Remember Adam's fall;
How he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) hath condemn'd all
In Hell perpetual
There for to dwell.

<p/>Remember God's goodnesse,
O thou Man:
Remember God's goodnesse,
His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) promise made.
Remember God's goodnesse;
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sent His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Son sinlesse
Our ails for to redress;
Be not afraid!

<p/>In Bethlehem He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was born,
O thou Man:
In Bethlehem He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was born,
For mankind's sake.
In Bethlehem He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was born,
Christmas-day i' the morn:
Our Saviour thought no scorn
Our faults to take.

<p/>Give thanks to God alway,
O thou Man:
Give thanks to God alway
With heart-most joy.
Give thanks to God alway
On this our joyful day:
Let all men sing and say,
Holy, Holy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the characters</b></font>)</div><p/>Having concluded the last note, they listened for a minute or two, but
found that no sound issued from the schoolhouse.

<p/>``Four breaths, and then, ``O, what unbounded goodness!<div class="bookquote">'' number
fifty-nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/>This was duly gone through, and no notice whatever seemed to be taken of
the performance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good guide us, surely `tisn't a' empty house, as befell us in the year
thirty-nine and forty-three!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said old Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s jist come from some musical city, and sneers at our
doings?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tranter whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Od rabbit her (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny, with an annihilating look at a corner
of the school chimney, <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite stomach her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), if this is it. Your
plain music well done is as worthy as your other sort done bad, a'
b`lieve, souls; so say I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Four breaths, and then the last,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>said the leader authoritatively.
<div class="bookquote">''`Rejoice, ye Tenants of the Earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>number sixty-four.''

<p/>At the close, waiting yet another minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) said in a clear loud voice,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) had said in the village at that hour and season for the previous
forty years--<div class="bookquote">``A merry Christmas to ye!''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V: THE LISTENERS


<p/>When the expectant stillness consequent upon the exclamation had nearly
died out of them all, an increasing light made itself visible in one of
the windows of the upper floor. It came so close to the blind that the
exact position of the flame could be perceived from the outside.
Remaining steady for an instant, the blind went upward from before it,
revealing to thirty concentrated eyes a young girl, framed as a picture
by the window architrave, and unconsciously illuminating her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) countenance
to a vivid brightness by a candle she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left hand, close to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
face, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) right hand being extended to the side of the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
wrapped in a white robe of some kind, whilst down her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders fell a
twining profusion of marvellously rich hair, in a wild disorder which
proclaimed it to be only during the invisible hours of the night that
such a condition was discoverable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bright eyes were looking into the
grey world outside with an uncertain expression, oscillating between
courage and shyness, which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) recognized the semicircular group of
dark forms gathered before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), transformed itself into pleasant
resolution.

<p/>Opening the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said lightly and warmly--<div class="bookquote">``Thank you, singers,
thank you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Together went the window quickly and quietly, and the blind started
downward on its return to its place. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fair forehead and eyes
vanished; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little mouth; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neck and shoulders; all of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Then the
spot of candlelight shone nebulously as before; then it moved away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dick Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'d been rale wexwork she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) couldn't ha' been comelier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael
Mail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As near a thing to a spiritual vision as ever I wish to see!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
tranter Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, sich I never, never see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said Leaf fervently.

<p/>All the rest, after clearing their throats and adjusting their hats,
agreed that such a sight was worth singing for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now to Farmer Shiner's, and then replenish our insides, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
the tranter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wi' all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William, shouldering his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) bass-viol.

<p/>Farmer Shiner's was a queer lump of a house, standing at the corner of a
lane that ran into the principal thoroughfare. The upper windows were
much wider than they were high, and this feature, together with a broad
bay-window where the door might have been expected, gave it by day the
aspect of a human countenance turned askance, and wearing a sly and
wicked leer. To-night nothing was visible but the outline of the roof
upon the sky.

<p/>The front of this building was reached, and the preliminaries arranged as
usual.

<p/>``Four breaths, and number thirty-two, <div class="bookquote">``Behold the Morning Star,'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
old William.

<p/>They had reached the end of the second verse, and the fiddlers were doing
the up bow-stroke previously to pouring forth the opening chord of the
third verse, when, without a light appearing or any signal being given, a
roaring voice exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut up, woll `ee! Don't make your blaring row here! A feller wi' a
headache enough to split his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) skull likes a quiet night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the fiddlers</b></font>)</div><p/>Slam went the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, that's a' ugly blow for we!''  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, in a keenly
appreciative voice, and turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) companions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Finish the carrel, all who be friends of harmony!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>commanded old
William; and they continued to the end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four breaths, and number nineteen!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said William firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Give it him (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>)
well; the quire can't be insulted in this manner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>A light now flashed into existence, the window opened, and the farmer
stood revealed as one in a terrific passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drown en!--drown en!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tranter cried, fiddling frantically. <div class="bookquote">``Play
fortissimy, and drown his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) spaking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fortissimy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael Mail, and the music and singing waxed so loud
that it was impossible to know what Mr. Shiner had said, was saying, or
was about to say; but wildly flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) arms and body about in the
forms of capital Xs and Ys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) appeared to utter enough invectives to
consign the whole parish to perdition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very onseemly--very!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William, as they retired. <div class="bookquote">``Never such a
dreadful scene in the whole round o' my carrel practice--never! And he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) a
churchwarden!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a drap o' drink got into his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) head,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``Man's well
enough when he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>)'s in his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) religious frame. He (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>)'s in his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) worldly frame now.
Must ask en to our bit of a party to-morrow night, I suppose, and so put
en in humour again. We bear no mortal man ill-will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Voss</b></font>)</div><p/>They now crossed Mellstock Bridge, and went along an embowered path
beside the Froom towards the church and vicarage, meeting Voss with the
hot mead and bread-and-cheese as they were approaching the churchyard.
This determined them to eat and drink before proceeding further, and they
entered the church and ascended to the gallery. The lanterns were
opened, and the whole body sat round against the walls on benches and
whatever else was available, and made a hearty meal. In the pauses of
conversation there could be heard through the floor overhead a little
world of undertones and creaks from the halting clockwork, which never
spread further than the tower they were born in, and raised in the more
meditative minds a fancy that here lay the direct pathway of Time.

<p/>Having done eating and drinking, they again tuned the instruments, and
once more the party emerged into the night air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Dick?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said old Dewy.

<p/>Every man looked round upon every other man, as if Dick might have been
transmuted into one or the other; and then they said they didn't know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now, that's what I call very nasty of Master Dicky, that I do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael Mail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)'ve clinked off home-along, depend upon't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>another suggested, though
not quite believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the tranter, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) voice rolled sonorously forth
among the yews.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) suspended his (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) muscles rigid as stone whilst listening for an answer,
and finding he (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) listened in vain, turned to the assemblage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The treble man too! Now if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d been a tenor or counter chap, we might
ha' contrived the rest o't without en, you see. But for a quire to lose
the treble, why, my sonnies, you may so well lose your ... ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
tranter paused, unable to mention an image vast enough for the occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your head at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Penny.

<p/>The tranter moved a pace, as if it were puerile of people to complete
sentences when there were more pressing things to be done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was ever heard such a thing as a young man leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work half done
and turning tail like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>replied Bowman, in a tone signifying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) was the last man in
the world to wish to withhold the formal finish required of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope no fatal tragedy has overtook the lad!''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowman</b></font>) grandfather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied tranter Dewy placidly. <div class="bookquote">``Wonder where he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s put that there
fiddle of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). Why that fiddle cost thirty shillings, and good words
besides. Somewhere in the damp, without doubt; that instrument will be
unglued and spoilt in ten minutes--ten! ay, two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What in the name o' righteousness can have happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William,
more uneasily. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s drownded!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaving their lanterns and instruments in the belfry they retraced their
steps along the waterside track. <div class="bookquote">``A strapping lad like Dick d'know
better than let anything happen onawares,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>Reuben remarked. <div class="bookquote">``There's
sure to be some poor little scram reason for't staring us in the face all
the while.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) voice to a mysterious tone: <div class="bookquote">``Neighbours, have
ye noticed any sign of a scornful woman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) head, or suchlike?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a glimmer of such a body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'s as clear as water yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Dicky said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) should never marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jimmy</b></font>)</div>cried Jimmy, <div class="bookquote">``but live at home
always along wi' mother and we!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jimmy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, my sonny; every lad has said that in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div><p/>They had now again reached the precincts of Mr. Shiner's, but hearing
nobody in that direction, one or two went across to the schoolhouse. A
light was still burning in the bedroom, and though the blind was down,
the window had been slightly opened, as if to admit the distant notes of
the carollers to the ears of the occupant of the room.

<p/>Opposite the window, leaning motionless against a beech tree, was the
lost man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms folded, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head thrown back, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the
illuminated lattice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Dick, is that thee? What b`st doing here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick's body instantly flew into a more rational attitude, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) head
was seen to turn east and west in the gloom, as if endeavouring to
discern some proper answer to that question; and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said in
rather feeble accents--<div class="bookquote">``Nothing, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Th`st take long enough time about it then, upon my body,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
tranter, as they all turned anew towards the vicarage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you hadn't done having snap in the gallery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, we've been traypsing and rambling about, looking everywhere, and
thinking you'd done fifty deathly things, and here have you been at
nothing at all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The stupidness lies in that point of it being nothing at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>murmured
Mr. Spinks.

<p/>The vicarage front was their next field of operation, and Mr. Maybold,
the lately-arrived incumbent, duly received his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) share of the night's
harmonies. It was hoped that by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) profession he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) would have
been led to open the window, and an extra carol in quick time was added
to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) forth. But Mr. Maybold made no stir.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A bad sign!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) head.

<p/>However, at that same instant a musical voice was heard exclaiming from
inner depths of bedclothes--<div class="bookquote">``Thanks, villagers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>asked Bowman, who was rather dull of hearing. Bowman's
voice, being therefore loud, had been heard by the vicar within.

<p/>``I said, <div class="bookquote">``Thanks, villagers!'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the vicar again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we didn't hear `ee the first time!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>cried Bowman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't for heaven's sake spoil the young man's temper by answering
like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't do that, my friends!''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>the vicar shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well to be sure, what ears!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Beats any
horse or dog in the parish, and depend upon't, that's a sign he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a
proper clever chap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall see that in time,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter.

<p/>Old William, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) gratitude for such thanks from a comparatively new
inhabitant, was anxious to play all the tunes over again; but renounced
his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) desire on being reminded by Reuben that it would be best to leave
well alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now putting two and two together,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tranter continued, as they went
their way over the hill, and across to the last remaining houses; <div class="bookquote">``that
is, in the form of that young female vision we zeed just now, and this
young tenor-voiced parson, my belief is she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll wind en round her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger,
and twist the pore young feller about like the figure of 8--that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will
so, my sonnies.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VI: CHRISTMAS MORNING


<p/>The choir at last reached their beds, and slept like the rest of the
parish. Dick's slumbers, through the three or four hours remaining for
rest, were disturbed and slight; an exhaustive variation upon the
incidents that had passed that night in connection with the school-window
going on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) brain every moment of the time.

<p/>In the morning, do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) would--go upstairs, downstairs, out of doors,
speak of the wind and weather, or what not--he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could not refrain from an
unceasing renewal, in imagination, of that interesting enactment. Tilted
on the edge of one foot he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) stood beside the fireplace, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
mother grilling rashers; but there was nothing in grilling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) thought,
unless the Vision grilled. The limp rasher hung down between the bars of
the gridiron like a cat in a child's arms; but there was nothing in
similes, unless She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uttered them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) looked at the daylight shadows of a
yellow hue, dancing with the firelight shadows in blue on the whitewashed
chimney corner, but there was nothing in shadows. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the new young
wom--sch--Miss Fancy Day will sing in church with us this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
said.

<p/>The tranter looked a long time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will; and
yet I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick implied that such a remark was rather to be tolerated than admired;
though deliberateness in speech was known to have, as a rule, more to do
with the machinery of the tranter's throat than with the matter
enunciated.

<p/>They made preparations for going to church as usual; Dick with extreme
alacrity, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) would not definitely consider why he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was so
religious. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) wonderful nicety in brushing and cleaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) best light
boots had features which elevated it to the rank of an art. Every
particle and speck of last week's mud was scraped and brushed from toe
and heel; new blacking from the packet was carefully mixed and made use
of, regardless of expense. A coat was laid on and polished; then another
coat for increased blackness; and lastly a third, to give the perfect and
mirror-like jet which the hoped-for rencounter demanded.

<p/>It being Christmas-day, the tranter prepared himself with Sunday
particularity. Loud sousing and snorting noises were heard to proceed
from a tub in the back quarters of the dwelling, proclaiming that he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was
there performing his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) great Sunday wash, lasting half-an-hour, to which
his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) washings on working-day mornings were mere flashes in the pan.
Vanishing into the outhouse with a large brown towel, and the above-named
bubblings and snortings being carried on for about twenty minutes, the
tranter would appear round the edge of the door, smelling like a summer
fog, and looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) had just narrowly escaped a watery grave with
the loss of much of his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) clothes, having since been weeping bitterly till
his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) eyes were red; a crystal drop of water hanging ornamentally at the
bottom of each ear, one at the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) nose, and others in the form of
spangles about his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) hair.

<p/>After a great deal of crunching upon the sanded stone floor by the feet
of father, son, and grandson as they moved to and fro in these
preparations, the bass-viol and fiddles were taken from their nook, and
the strings examined and screwed a little above concert-pitch, that they
might keep their tone when the service began, to obviate the awkward
contingency of having to retune them at the back of the gallery during a
cough, sneeze, or amen--an inconvenience which had been known to arise in
damp wintry weather.

<p/>The three left the door and paced down Mellstock-lane and across the ewe-
lease, bearing under their arms the instruments in faded green-baize
bags, and old brown music-books in their hands; Dick continually finding
himself in advance of the other two, and the tranter moving on with toes
turned outwards to an enormous angle.

<p/>At the foot of an incline the church became visible through the north
gate, or `church hatch,'' as it was called here. Seven agile figures in a
clump were observable beyond, which proved to be the choristers waiting;
sitting on an altar-tomb to pass the time, and letting their heels dangle
against it. The musicians being now in sight, the youthful party
scampered off and rattled up the old wooden stairs of the gallery like a
regiment of cavalry; the other boys of the parish waiting outside and
observing birds, cats, and other creatures till the vicar entered, when
they suddenly subsided into sober church-goers, and passed down the aisle
with echoing heels.

<p/>The gallery of Mellstock Church had a status and sentiment of its own. A
stranger there was regarded with a feeling altogether differing from that
of the congregation below towards him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). Banished from the nave as an
intruder whom no originality could make interesting, he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) was received
above as a curiosity that no unfitness could render dull. The gallery,
too, looked down upon and knew the habits of the nave to its remotest
peculiarity, and had an extensive stock of exclusive information about
it; whilst the nave knew nothing of the gallery folk, as gallery folk,
beyond their loud-sounding minims and chest notes. Such topics as that
the clerk was always chewing tobacco except at the moment of crying amen;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) had a dust-hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) pew; that during the sermon certain young
daughters of the village had left off caring to read anything so mild as
the marriage service for some years, and now regularly studied the one
which chronologically follows it; that a pair of lovers touched fingers
through a knot-hole between their pews in the manner ordained by their
great exemplars, Pyramus and Thisbe; that Mrs. Ledlow, the farmer's wife,
counted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money and reckoned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) week's marketing expenses during the
first lesson--all news to those below--were stale subjects here.

<p/>Old William sat in the centre of the front row, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) violoncello between
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knees and two singers on each hand. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), on the left, came
the treble singers and Dick; and on the right the tranter and the tenors.
Farther back was old Mail with the altos and supernumeraries.

<p/>But before they had taken their places, and whilst they were standing in
a circle at the back of the gallery practising a psalm or two, Dick cast
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) eyes over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) grandfather's shoulder, and saw the vision of the past
night enter the porch-door as methodically as if she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had never been a
vision at all. A new atmosphere seemed suddenly to be puffed into the
ancient edifice by her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) movement, which made Dick's body and soul tingle
with novel sensations. Directed by Shiner, the churchwarden, she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
proceeded to the small aisle on the north side of the chancel, a spot now
allotted to a throng of Sunday-school girls, and distinctly visible from
the gallery-front by looking under the curve of the furthermost arch on
that side.

<p/>Before this moment the church had seemed comparatively empty--now it was
thronged; and as Miss Fancy rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) knees and looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for
a permanent place in which to deposit herself--finally choosing the
remotest corner--Dick began to breathe more freely the warm new air she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>); to feel rushings of blood, and to have impressions
that there was a tie between her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and himself visible to all the
congregation.

<p/>Ever afterwards the young man could recollect individually each part of
the service of that bright Christmas morning, and the trifling
occurrences which took place as its minutes slowly drew along; the duties
of that day dividing themselves by a complete line from the services of
other times. The tunes they that morning essayed remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for
years, apart from all others; also the text; also the appearance of the
layer of dust upon the capitals of the piers; that the holly-bough in the
chancel archway was hung a little out of the centre--all the ideas, in
short, that creep into the mind when reason is only exercising its lowest
activity through the eye.

<p/>By chance or by fate, another young man who attended Mellstock Church on
that Christmas morning had towards the end of the service the same
instinctive perception of an interesting presence, in the shape of the
same bright maiden, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emotion reached a far less developed
stage. And there was this difference, too, that the person in question
was surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition, and sedulously endeavoured to reduce
himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) normal state of mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the young vicar, Mr.
Maybold.

<p/>The music on Christmas mornings was frequently below the standard of
church-performances at other times. The boys were sleepy from the heavy
exertions of the night; the men were slightly wearied; and now, in
addition to these constant reasons, there was a dampness in the
atmosphere that still further aggravated the evil. Their strings, from
the recent long exposure to the night air, rose whole semitones, and
snapped with a loud twang at the most silent moment; which necessitated
more retiring than ever to the back of the gallery, and made the gallery
throats quite husky with the quantity of coughing and hemming required
for tuning in. The vicar looked cross.

<p/>When the singing was in progress there was suddenly discovered to be a
strong and shrill reinforcement from some point, ultimately found to be
the school-girls' aisle. At every attempt it grew bolder and more
distinct. At the third time of singing, these intrusive feminine voices
were as mighty as those of the regular singers; in fact, the flood of
sound from this quarter assumed such an individuality, that it had a
time, a key, almost a tune of its own, surging upwards when the gallery
plunged downwards, and the reverse.

<p/>Now this had never happened before within the memory of man. The girls,
like the rest of the congregation, had always been humble and respectful
followers of the gallery; singing at sixes and sevens if without gallery
leaders; never interfering with the ordinances of these practised
artists--having no will, union, power, or proclivity except it was given
them from the established choir enthroned above them.

<p/>A good deal of desperation became noticeable in the gallery throats and
strings, which continued throughout the musical portion of the service.
Directly the fiddles were laid down, Mr. Penny's spectacles put in their
sheath, and the text had been given out, an indignant whispering began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did ye hear that, souls?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>Mr. Penny said, in a groaning breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brazen-faced hussies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Bowman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True; why, they were every note as loud as we, fiddles and all, if not
louder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiddles and all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>echoed Bowman bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall anything saucier be found than united `ooman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>Mr. Spinks
murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I want to know is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the tranter -LRB-as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) knew already, but
that civilization required the form of words-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``what business people have
to tell maidens to sing like that when they don't sit in a gallery, and
never have entered one in their lives? That's the question, my sonnies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis the gallery have got to sing, all the world knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, souls, what's the use o' the ancients spending scores of pounds to
build galleries if people down in the lowest depths of the church sing
like that at a moment's notice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, I think we useless ones had better march out of church, fiddles
and all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Spinks, with a laugh which, to a stranger, would have
sounded mild and real. Only the initiated body of men he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) addressed could
understand the horrible bitterness of irony that lurked under the quiet
words `useless ones,'' and the ghastliness of the laughter apparently so
natural.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind! Let 'em sing too--`twill make it all the louder--hee, hee!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said Leaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomas Leaf, Thomas Leaf! Where have you lived all your life?''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said
grandfather William sternly.

<p/>The quailing Leaf tried to look as if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had lived nowhere at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When all's said and done, my sonnies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>Reuben said, <div class="bookquote">``there'd have been
no real harm in their singing if they had let nobody hear 'em, and only
jined in now and then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny. <div class="bookquote">``But though I don't wish to accuse people
wrongfully, I'd say before my lord judge that I could hear every note o'
that last psalm come from 'em as much as from us--every note as if 'twas
their own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Know it! ah, I should think I did know it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>Mr. Spinks was heard to
observe at this moment, without reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) fellow players--shaking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) head at some idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) seemed to see floating before him (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>), and smiling
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) were attending a funeral at the time. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, do I or don't I know
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No one said <div class="bookquote">``Know what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>because all were aware from experience that what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) knew would declare itself in process of time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could fancy last night that we should have some trouble wi' that young
man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, pending the continuance of Spinks's speech, and
looking towards the unconscious Mr. Maybold in the pulpit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William, rather severely, <div class="bookquote">``I fancy there's too much
whispering going on to be of any spiritual use to gentle or simple.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>Then
folding his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lips and concentrating his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) glance on the vicar, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) implied
that none but the ignorant would speak again; and accordingly there was
silence in the gallery, Mr. Spinks's telling speech remaining for ever
unspoken.

<p/>Dick had said nothing, and the tranter little, on this episode of the
morning; for Mrs. Dewy at breakfast expressed it as her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) intention to
invite the youthful leader of the culprits to the small party it was
customary with them to have on Christmas night--a piece of knowledge
which had given a particular brightness to Dick's reflections since he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
had received it. And in the tranter's slightly-cynical nature, party
feeling was weaker than in the other members of the choir, though
friendliness and faithful partnership still sustained in him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) a hearty
earnestness on their account.



<p/>CHAPTER VII: THE TRANTER``S PARTY


<p/>During the afternoon unusual activity was seen to prevail about the
precincts of tranter Dewy's house. The flagstone floor was swept of
dust, and a sprinkling of the finest yellow sand from the innermost
stratum of the adjoining sand-pit lightly scattered thereupon. Then were
produced large knives and forks, which had been shrouded in darkness and
grease since the last occasion of the kind, and bearing upon their sides,
<div class="bookquote">``Shear-steel, warranted,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in such emphatic letters of assurance, that the
warranter's name was not required as further proof, and not given. The
key was left in the tap of the cider-barrel, instead of being carried in
a pocket. And finally the tranter had to stand up in the room and let
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) wife wheel him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) round like a turnstile, to see if anything
discreditable was visible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand still till I've been for the scissors,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dewy.

<p/>The tranter stood as still as a sentinel at the challenge.

<p/>The only repairs necessary were a trimming of one or two whiskers that
had extended beyond the general contour of the mass; a like trimming of a
slightly-frayed edge visible on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) shirt-collar; and a final tug at a
grey hair--to all of which operations he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) submitted in resigned silence,
except the last, which produced a mild <div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Ann,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by way of
expostulation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Reuben, `tis quite a disgrace to see such a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>a companion</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Dewy, with the severity justifiable in a long-tried companion, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
another turn round, and picking several of Smiler's hairs from the
shoulder of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) coat. Reuben's thoughts seemed engaged elsewhere, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
yawned. <div class="bookquote">``And the collar of your coat is a shame to behold--so plastered
with dirt, or dust, or grease, or something. Why, wherever could you
have got it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis my warm nater in summer-time, I suppose. I always did get in such
a heat when I bustle about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ay, the Dewys always were such a coarse-skinned family. There's your
brother Bob just as bad--as fat as a porpoise--wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) low, mean, ``How`st
do, Ann?'' whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) meets me. I'd <div class="bookquote">``How`st do' him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) indeed! If the sun
only shines out a minute, there be you all streaming in the face--I never
see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I be hot week-days, I must be hot Sundays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If any of the girls should turn after their father `twill be a bad look-
out for 'em, poor things! None of my family were sich vulgar sweaters,
not one of 'em. But, Lord-a-mercy, the Dewys! I don't know how ever I
cam' into such a family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your woman's weakness when I asked ye to jine us. That's how it was I
suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>But the tranter appeared to have heard some such words from
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) wife before, and hence his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) answer had not the energy it might have
shown if the inquiry had possessed the charm of novelty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never did look so well in a pair o' trousers as in them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
continued in the same unimpassioned voice, so that the unfriendly
criticism of the Dewy family seemed to have been more normal than
spontaneous. <div class="bookquote">``Such a cheap pair as 'twas too. As big as any man could
wish to have, and lined inside, and double-lined in the lower parts, and
an extra piece of stiffening at the bottom. And `tis a nice high cut
that comes up right under your armpits, and there's enough turned down
inside the seams to make half a pair more, besides a piece of cloth left
that will make an honest waistcoat--all by my contriving in buying the
stuff at a bargain, and having it made up under my eye. It only shows
what may be done by taking a little trouble, and not going straight to
the rascally tailors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>The discourse was cut short by the sudden appearance of Charley on the
scene, with a face and hands of hideous blackness, and a nose like a
guttering candle. Why, on that particularly cleanly afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) should
have discovered that the chimney-crook and chain from which the hams were
suspended should have possessed more merits and general interest as
playthings than any other articles in the house, is a question for
nursing mothers to decide. However, the humour seemed to lie in the
result being, as has been seen, that any given player with these articles
was in the long-run daubed with soot. The last that was seen of Charley
by daylight after this piece of ingenuity was when in the act of
vanishing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) father's presence round the corner of the
house--looking back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) shoulder with an expression of great sin on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) face, like Cain as the Outcast in Bible pictures.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>The guests had all assembled, and the tranter's party had reached that
degree of development which accords with ten o'clock P.M. in rural
assemblies. At that hour the sound of a fiddle in process of tuning was
heard from the inner pantry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Dick,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``That lad's crazy for a jig.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick! Now I cannot--really, I cannot have any dancing at all till
Christmas-day is out,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William emphatically. <div class="bookquote">``When the clock
ha' done striking twelve, dance as much as ye like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must say there's reason in that, William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny. <div class="bookquote">``If
you do have a party on Christmas-night, `tis only fair and honourable to
the sky-folk to have it a sit-still party. Jigging parties be all very
well on the Devil's holidays; but a jigging party looks suspicious now. O
yes; stop till the clock strikes, young folk--so say I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div><p/>It happened that some warm mead accidentally got into Mr. Spinks's head
about this time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dancing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinks</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is a most strengthening, livening, and courting
movement, `specially with a little beverage added! And dancing is good.
But why disturb what is ordained, Richard and Reuben, and the company
zhinerally? Why, I ask, as far as that do go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then nothing till after twelve,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/>Though Reuben and his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) wife ruled on social points, religious questions
were mostly disposed of by the old man, whose firmness on this head quite
counterbalanced a certain weakness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handling of domestic matters.
The hopes of the younger members of the household were therefore
relegated to a distance of one hour and three-quarters--a result that
took visible shape in them by a remote and listless look about the
eyes--the singing of songs being permitted in the interim.

<p/>At five minutes to twelve the soft tuning was again heard in the back
quarters; and when at length the clock had whizzed forth the last stroke,
Dick appeared ready primed, and the instruments were boldly handled; old
William very readily taking the bass-viol from its accustomed nail, and
touching the strings as irreligiously as could be desired.

<p/>The country-dance called the <div class="bookquote">``Triumph, or Follow my Lover,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the
figure with which they opened. The tranter took for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) partner Mrs.
Penny, and Mrs. Dewy was chosen by Mr. Penny, who made so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>)
limited height by a judicious carriage of the head, straightening of the
back, and important flashes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) spectacle-glasses, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) seemed
almost as tall as the tranter. Mr. Shiner, age about thirty-five, farmer
and church-warden, a character principally composed of a crimson stare,
vigorous breath, and a watch-chain, with a mouth hanging on a dark smile
but never smiling, had come quite willingly to the party, and showed a
wondrous obliviousness of all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) antics on the previous night. But the
comely, slender, prettily-dressed prize Fancy Day fell to Dick's lot, in
spite of some private machinations of the farmer, for the reason that Mr.
Shiner, as a richer man, had shown too much assurance in asking the
favour, whilst Dick had been duly courteous.

<p/>We gain a good view of our heroine as she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) advances to her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) place in the
ladies' line. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) belonged to the taller division of middle height.
Flexibility was her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) first characteristic, by which she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) appeared to enjoy
the most easeful rest when she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was in gliding motion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) dark
eyes--arched by brows of so keen, slender, and soft a curve, that they
resembled nothing so much as two slurs in music--showed primarily a
bright sparkle each. This was softened by a frequent thoughtfulness, yet
not so frequent as to do away, for more than a few minutes at a time,
with a certain coquettishness; which in its turn was never so decided as
to banish honesty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) lips imitated her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) brows in their clearly-cut
outline and softness of bend; and her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) nose was well shaped--which is
saying a great deal, when it is remembered that there are a hundred
pretty mouths and eyes for one pretty nose. Add to this, plentiful knots
of dark-brown hair, a gauzy dress of white, with blue facings; and the
slightest idea may be gained of the young maiden who showed, amidst the
rest of the dancing-ladies, like a flower among vegetables. And so the
dance proceeded. Mr. Shiner, according to the interesting rule laid
down, deserted his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) own partner, and made off down the middle with this
fair one of Dick's--the pair appearing from the top of the room like two
persons tripping down a lane to be married. Dick trotted behind with
what was intended to be a look of composure, but which was, in fact, a
rather silly expression of feature--implying, with too much earnestness,
that such an elopement could not be tolerated. Then they turned and came
back, when Dick grew more rigid around his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mouth, and blushed with
ingenuous ardour as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) joined hands with the rival and formed the arch
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) lady's head; which presumably gave the figure its name;
relinquishing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again at setting to partners, when Mr. Shiner's new
chain quivered in every link, and all the loose flesh upon the
tranter--who here came into action again--shook like jelly. Mrs. Penny,
being always rather concerned for her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) personal safety when she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) danced
with the tranter, fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) face to a chronic smile of timidity the whole
time it lasted--a peculiarity which filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) features with wrinkles,
and reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) eyes to little straight lines like hyphens, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) jigged
up and down opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>); repeating in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) own person not only his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) proper
movements, but also the minor flourishes which the richness of the
tranter's imagination led him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) to introduce from time to time--an
imitation which had about it something of slavish obedience, not unmixed
with fear.

<p/>The ear-rings of the ladies now flung themselves wildly about, turning
violent summersaults, banging this way and that, and then swinging
quietly against the ears sustaining them. Mrs. Crumpler--a heavy woman,
who, for some reason which nobody ever thought worth inquiry, danced in a
clean apron--moved so smoothly through the figure that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet were
never seen; conveying to imaginative minds the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rolled on
castors.

<p/>Minute after minute glided by, and the party reached the period when
ladies' back-hair begins to look forgotten and dissipated; when a
perceptible dampness makes itself apparent upon the faces even of
delicate girls--a ghastly dew having for some time rained from the
features of their masculine partners; when skirts begin to be torn out of
their gathers; when elderly people, who have stood up to please their
juniors, begin to feel sundry small tremblings in the region of the
knees, and to wish the interminable dance was at Jericho; when -LRB-at
country parties of the thorough sort-RRB- waistcoats begin to be unbuttoned,
and when the fiddlers' chairs have been wriggled, by the frantic bowing
of their occupiers, to a distance of about two feet from where they
originally stood.

<p/>Fancy was dancing with Mr. Shiner. Dick knew that Fancy, by the law of
good manners, was bound to dance as pleasantly with one partner as with
another; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could not help suggesting to himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>occupiers</b></font>) need not
have put quite so much spirit into her (<font color='blue'><b>occupiers</b></font>) steps, nor smiled quite so
frequently whilst in the farmer's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you didn't cast off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick mildly to Mr. Shiner, before
the latter man's watch-chain had done vibrating from a recent whirl.

<p/>Fancy made a motion of accepting the correction; but her (<font color='blue'><b>occupiers</b></font>) partner took no
notice, and proceeded with the next movement, with an affectionate bend
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>occupiers</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That Shiner's too fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man said to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
watched them. They came to the top again, Fancy smiling warmly towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>occupiers</b></font>) partner, and went to their places.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Shiner, you didn't cast off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, for want of something else
to demolish him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) with; casting off himself, and being put out at the
farmer's irregularity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I sha'n't cast off for any man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shiner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you ought to, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick's partner, a young lady of the name of Lizzy--called Lizz for
short--tried to mollify.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say that I myself have much feeling for casting off,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny, following up the argument, <div class="bookquote">``especially if a
friend and neighbour is set against it. Not but that `tis a terrible
tasty thing in good hands and well done; yes, indeed, so say I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All I meant was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, rather sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had spoken
correctingly to a guest, <div class="bookquote">``that `tis in the dance; and a man has hardly
any right to hack and mangle what was ordained by the regular
dance-maker, who, I daresay, got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) living by making 'em, and thought of
nothing else all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a guest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like casting off: then very well; I cast off for no dance-maker
that ever lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick now appeared to be doing mental arithmetic, the act being really an
effort to present to himself, in an abstract form, how far an argument
with a formidable rival ought to be carried, when that rival was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
mother's guest. The dead-lock was put an end to by the stamping arrival
up the middle of the tranter, who, despising minutiae on principle,
started a theme of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you, neighbours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the heat of my frame no tongue can
tell!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) looked around and endeavoured to give, by a forcible gaze of
self-sympathy, some faint idea of the truth.

<p/>Mrs. Dewy formed one of the next couple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) said, in an auxiliary tone, <div class="bookquote">``Reuben always was such a hot
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penny implied the species of sympathy that such a class of
affliction required, by trying to smile and to look grieved at the same
time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only walk round the garden of a Sunday morning, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shirt-collar
is as limp as no starch at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Dewy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) countenance
lapsing parenthetically into a housewifely expression of concern at the
reminiscence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, you women-folk; `tis hands across--come, come!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
tranter; and the conversation ceased for the present.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII: THEY DANCE MORE WILDLY


<p/>Dick had at length secured Fancy for that most delightful of
country-dances, opening with six-hands-round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before we begin,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, <div class="bookquote">``my proposal is, that `twould be a
right and proper plan for every mortal man in the dance to pull off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
jacket, considering the heat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such low notions as you have, Reuben! Nothing but strip will go down
with you when you are a-dancing. Such a hot man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, look here, my sonnies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) argued to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) wife, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) often
addressed in the plural masculine for economy of epithet merely; <div class="bookquote">``I don't
see that. You dance and get hot as fire; therefore you lighten your
clothes. Isn't that nature and reason for gentle and simple? If I strip
by myself and not necessary, `tis rather pot-housey I own; but if we
stout chaps strip one and all, why, `tis the native manners of the
country, which no man can gainsay? Hey--what did you say, my sonnies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strip we will!''  (<font color='red'><b>the men coats</b></font>)</div>said the three other heavy men who were in the dance;
and their coats were accordingly taken off and hung in the passage,
whence the four sufferers from heat soon reappeared, marching in close
column, with flapping shirt-sleeves, and having, as common to them all, a
general glance of being now a match for any man or dancer in England or
Ireland. Dick, fearing to lose ground in Fancy's good opinion, retained
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) coat like the rest of the thinner men; and Mr. Shiner did the same
from superior knowledge.

<p/>And now a further phase of revelry had disclosed itself. It was the time
of night when a guest may write his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) name in the dust upon the tables and
chairs, and a bluish mist pervades the atmosphere, becoming a distinct
halo round the candles; when people's nostrils, wrinkles, and crevices in
general, seem to be getting gradually plastered up; when the very
fiddlers as well as the dancers get red in the face, the dancers having
advanced further still towards incandescence, and entered the cadaverous
phase; the fiddlers no longer sit down, but kick back their chairs and
saw madly at the strings, with legs firmly spread and eyes closed,
regardless of the visible world. Again and again did Dick share his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
Love's hand with another man, and wheel round; then, more delightfully,
promenade in a circle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) all to himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) arm holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) waist
more firmly each time, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) elbow getting further and further behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) back, till the distance reached was rather noticeable; and, most
blissful, swinging to places shoulder to shoulder, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) breath curling
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) neck like a summer zephyr that had strayed from its proper
date. Threading the couples one by one they reached the bottom, when
there arose in Dick's mind a minor misery lest the tune should end before
they could work their way to the top again, and have anew the same
exciting run down through. Dick's feelings on actually reaching the top
in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) doubts were supplemented by a mortal fear that the
fiddling might even stop at this supreme moment; which prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) to
convey a stealthy whisper to the far-gone musicians, to the effect that
they were not to leave off till he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) partner had reached the bottom
of the dance once more, which remark was replied to by the nearest of
those convulsed and quivering men by a private nod to the anxious young
man between two semiquavers of the tune, and a simultaneous <div class="bookquote">``All right,
ay, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>without opening the eyes. Fancy was now held so closely that
Dick and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) were practically one person. The room became to Dick like a
picture in a dream; all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could remember of it afterwards being the
look of the fiddlers going to sleep, as humming-tops sleep, by increasing
their motion and hum, together with the figures of grandfather James and
old Simon Crumpler sitting by the chimney-corner, talking and nodding in
dumb-show, and beating the air to their emphatic sentences like people
near a threshing machine.

<p/>The dance ended. <div class="bookquote">``Piph-h-h-h!''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said tranter Dewy, blowing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) breath
in the very finest stream of vapour that a man's lips could form. <div class="bookquote">``A
regular tightener, that one, sonnies!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) forehead, and went
to the cider and ale mugs on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny, flopping into a chair, <div class="bookquote">``my heart haven't been in
such a thumping state of uproar since I used to sit up on old Midsummer-
eves to see who my husband was going to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's getting on for a good few years ago now, from what I've heard
you tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, without lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) eyes from the cup he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) was
filling. Being now engaged in the business of handing round
refreshments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) was warranted in keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) coat off still, though the
other heavy men had resumed theirs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And a thing I never expected would come to pass, if you'll believe me,
came to pass then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Penny. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, the first spirit ever I
see on a Midsummer-eve was a puzzle to me when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appeared, a hard
puzzle, so say I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I should have fancied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elias Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Elias Spinks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) glance into past times, and talking
on in a running tone of complacent abstraction, as if a listener were not
a necessity. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; never was I in such a taking as on that Midsummer-
eve! I sat up, quite determined to see if John Wildway was going to
marry me or no. I put the bread-and-cheese and beer quite ready, as the
witch's book ordered, and I opened the door, and I waited till the clock
struck twelve, my nerves all alive and so strained that I could feel
every one of 'em twitching like bell-wires. Yes, sure! and when the
clock had struck, lo and behold, I could see through the door a little
small man in the lane wi' a shoemaker's apron on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Penny stealthily enlarged himself half an inch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, John Wildway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penny continued, <div class="bookquote">``who courted me at that time,
was a shoemaker, you see, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildway</b></font>) was a very fair-sized man, and I
couldn't believe that any such a little small man had anything to do wi'
me, as anybody might. But on he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came, and crossed the threshold--not
John, but actually the same little small man in the shoemaker's apron--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't be so mighty particular about little and small!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>)
husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walks, and down he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sits, and O my goodness me, didn't I flee
upstairs, body and soul hardly hanging together! Well, to cut a long
story short, by-long and by-late, John Wildway and I had a miff and
parted; and lo and behold, the coming man came! Penny asked me if I'd go
snacks with him (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>), and afore I knew what I was about a`most, the thing was
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've fancied you never knew better in your life; but I mid be mistaken,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny in a murmur.

<p/>After Mrs. Penny had spoken, there being no new occupation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) eyes,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) still let them stay idling on the past scenes just related, which
were apparently visible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) in the centre of the room. Mr. Penny's
remark received no reply.

<p/>During this discourse the tranter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) wife might have been observed
standing in an unobtrusive corner, in mysterious closeness to each other,
a just perceptible current of intelligence passing from each to each,
which had apparently no relation whatever to the conversation of their
guests, but much to their sustenance. A conclusion of some kind having
at length been drawn, the palpable confederacy of man and wife was once
more obliterated, the tranter marching off into the pantry, humming a
tune that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't quite recollect, and then breaking into the words
of a song of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could remember about one line and a quarter. Mrs.
Dewy spoke a few words about preparations for a bit of supper.

<p/>That elder portion of the company which loved eating and drinking put on
a look to signify that till this moment they had quite forgotten that it
was customary to expect suppers on these occasions; going even further
than this politeness of feature, and starting irrelevant subjects, the
exceeding flatness and forced tone of which rather betrayed their object.
The younger members said they were quite hungry, and that supper would be
delightful though it was so late.

<p/>Good luck attended Dick's love-passes during the meal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) sat next
Fancy, and had the thrilling pleasure of using permanently a glass which
had been taken by Fancy in mistake; of letting the outer edge of the sole
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) boot touch the lower verge of her (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) skirt; and to add to these
delights the cat, which had lain unobserved in her (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) lap for several
minutes, crept across into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) own, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) with fur that had
touched her (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) hand a moment before. There were, besides, some little
pleasures in the shape of helping her (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) to vegetable she (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) didn't want, and
when it had nearly alighted on her (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) plate taking it across for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) own
use, on the plea of waste not, want not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) also, from time to time,
sipped sweet sly glances at her (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) profile; noticing the set of her (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) head,
the curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) throat, and other artistic properties of the lively
goddess, who the while kept up a rather free, not to say too free,
conversation with Mr. Shiner sitting opposite; which, after some uneasy
criticism, and much shifting of argument backwards and forwards in Dick's
mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) decided not to consider of alarming significance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A new music greets our ears now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the fiddlers</b></font>)</div>said Miss Fancy, alluding, with the
sharpness that her (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) position as village sharpener demanded, to the
contrast between the rattle of knives and forks and the late notes of the
fiddlers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay; and I don't know but what `tis sweeter in tone when you get above
forty,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter; <div class="bookquote">``except, in faith, as regards father there.
Never such a mortal man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for tunes. They do move his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul; don't
'em, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/>The eldest Dewy smiled across from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) distant chair an assent to
Reuben's remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spaking of being moved in soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny, ``I shall never forget
the first time I heard the ``Dead March.'' <div class="bookquote">``Twas at poor Corp'l Nineman's
funeral at Casterbridge. It fairly made my hair creep and fidget about
like a vlock of sheep--ah, it did, souls! And when they had done, and
the last trump had sounded, and the guns was fired over the dead hero's
grave, a' icy-cold drop o' moist sweat hung upon my forehead, and another
upon my jawbone. Ah, `tis a very solemn thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as to father in the corner there,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>the tranter said, pointing to
old William, who was in the act of filling his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mouth; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d starve to
death for music's sake now, as much as when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a boy-chap of
fifteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael Mail, clearing the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) throat in the
manner of a man who meant to be convincing; <div class="bookquote">``there's a friendly tie of
some sort between music and eating.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) lifted the cup to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) mouth, and
drank himself gradually backwards from a perpendicular position to a
slanting one, during which time his (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) looks performed a circuit from the
wall opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) to the ceiling overhead. Then clearing the other
corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mail</b></font>) throat: <div class="bookquote">``Once I was a-setting in the little kitchen of the
Dree Mariners at Casterbridge, having a bit of dinner, and a brass band
struck up in the street. Such a beautiful band as that were! I was
setting eating fried liver and lights, I well can mind--ah, I was! and to
save my life, I couldn't help chawing to the tune. Band played six-eight
time; six-eight chaws I, willynilly. Band plays common; common time went
my teeth among the liver and lights as true as a hair. Beautiful `twere!
Ah, I shall never forget that there band!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's as tuneful a thing as ever I heard of,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said grandfather James,
with the absent gaze which accompanies profound criticism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like Michael's tuneful stories then,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dewy. <div class="bookquote">``They are
quite coarse to a person o' decent taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div><p/>Old Michael's mouth twitched here and there, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wanted to smile but
didn't know where to begin, which gradually settled to an expression that
it was not displeasing for a nice woman like the tranter's wife to
correct him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben, with decisive earnestness, <div class="bookquote">``that sort o' coarse
touch that's so upsetting to Ann's feelings is to my mind a
recommendation; for it do always prove a story to be true. And for the
same reason, I like a story with a bad moral. My sonnies, all true
stories have a coarse touch or a bad moral, depend upon't. If the story-
tellers could ha' got decency and good morals from true stories, who'd
ha' troubled to invent parables?''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>Saying this the tranter arose to fetch
a new stock of cider, ale, mead, and home-made wines.

<p/>Mrs. Dewy sighed, and appended a remark -LRB-ostensibly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) husband's
back, though that the words should reach his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ears distinctly was
understood by both-RRB-: ``Such a man as Dewy is! Nobody do know the trouble
I have to keep that man barely respectable. And did you ever hear
too--just now at supper-time--talking about `taties' with Michael in such
a work-folk way. Well, `tis what I was never brought up to! With our
family 'twas never less than ``taters,<div class="bookquote">'' and very often `pertatoes'
outright; mother was so particular and nice with us girls there was no
family in the parish that kept them selves up more than we.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The hour of parting came. Fancy could not remain for the night, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had engaged a woman to wait up for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disappeared temporarily
from the flagging party of dancers, and then came downstairs wrapped up
and looking altogether a different person from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been
hitherto, in fact -LRB-to Dick's sadness and disappointment-RRB-, a woman
somewhat reserved and of a phlegmatic temperament--nothing left in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of
the romping girl that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seemed but a short quarter-hour before, who
had not minded the weight of Dick's hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waist, nor shirked the
purlieus of the mistletoe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a difference!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man tem</b></font>)</div>thought the young man--hoary cynic pro tem. <div class="bookquote">``What a
miserable deceiving difference between the manners of a maid's life at
dancing times and at others! Look at this lovely Fancy! Through the
whole past evening touchable, squeezeable--even kissable! For whole half-
hours I held her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) so chose to me that not a sheet of paper could have been
shipped between us; and I could feel her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heart only just outside my own,
her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) life beating on so close to mine, that I was aware of every breath in
it. A flit is made upstairs--a hat and a cloak put on--and I no more
dare to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) than--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Thought failed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned to
realities.

<p/>But this was an endurable misery in comparison with what followed. Mr.
Shiner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) watch-chain, taking the intrusive advantage that ardent
bachelors who are going homeward along the same road as a pretty young
woman always do take of that circumstance, came forward to assure
Fancy--with a total disregard of Dick's emotions, and in tones which were
certainly not frigid--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) -LRB-Shiner-RRB- was not the man to go to bed
before seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) Lady Fair safe within her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own door--not he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), nobody
should say he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was that;--and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) side an inch
till the thing was done--drown him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) would. The proposal was
assented to by Miss Day, in Dick's foreboding judgment, with one
degree--or at any rate, an appreciable fraction of a degree--of warmth
beyond that required by a disinterested desire for protection from the
dangers of the night.

<p/>All was over; and Dick surveyed the chair she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had last occupied, looking
now like a setting from which the gem has been torn. There stood her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
glass, and the romantic teaspoonful of elder wine at the bottom that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
couldn't drink by trying ever so hard, in obedience to the mighty
arguments of the tranter -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hand coming down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) shoulder the
while, like a Nasmyth hammer-RRB-; but the drinker was there no longer. There
were the nine or ten pretty little crumbs she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had left on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) plate; but
the eater was no more seen.

<p/>There seemed a disagreeable closeness of relationship between himself and
the members of his (<font color='blue'><b>eater</b></font>) family, now that they were left alone again face to
face. His (<font color='blue'><b>eater</b></font>) father seemed quite offensive for appearing to be in just as
high spirits as when the guests were there; and as for grandfather James
-LRB-who had not yet left-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was quite fiendish in being rather glad they
were gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, in a tone of placid satisfaction, <div class="bookquote">``I've had
so little time to attend to myself all the evenen, that I mean to enjoy a
quiet meal now! A slice of this here ham--neither too fat nor too
lean--so; and then a drop of this vinegar and pickles--there, that's
it--and I shall be as fresh as a lark again! And to tell the truth, my
sonny, my inside has been as dry as a lime-basket all night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like a party very well once in a while,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dewy, leaving off
the adorned tones she (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had been bound to use throughout the evening, and
returning to the natural marriage voice; <div class="bookquote">``but, Lord, `tis such a sight of
heavy work next day! What with the dirty plates, and knives and forks,
and dust and smother, and bits kicked off your furniture, and I don't
know what all, why a body could a`most wish there were no such things as
Christmases ... Ah-h dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) yawned, till the clock in the corner
had ticked several beats. She (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) cast her (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) eyes round upon the displaced,
dust-laden furniture, and sank down overpowered at the sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I be getting all right by degrees, thank the Lord for`t!''  (<font color='red'><b>ham bread</b></font>)</div>said the
tranter cheerfully through a mangled mass of ham and bread, without
lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) plate, and chopping away with his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) knife and
fork as if he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) were felling trees. <div class="bookquote">``Ann, you may as well go on to bed at
once, and not bide there making such sleepy faces; you look as
long-favoured as a fiddle, upon my life, Ann. There, you must be wearied
out, `tis true. I'll do the doors and draw up the clock; and you go on,
or you'll be as white as a sheet to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay; I don't know whether I shan't or no.''  (<font color='red'><b>The matron</b></font>)</div>The matron passed her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) hand
across her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) eyes to brush away the film of sleep till she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) got upstairs.

<p/>Dick wondered how it was that when people were married they could be so
blind to romance; and was quite certain that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) ever took to wife that
dear impossible Fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would never be so dreadfully practical
and undemonstrative of the Passion as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) father and mother were. The
most extraordinary thing was, that all the fathers and mothers he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) knew
were just as undemonstrative as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) own.



<p/>CHAPTER IX: DICK CALLS AT THE SCHOOL


<p/>The early days of the year drew on, and Fancy, having spent the holiday
weeks at home, returned again to Mellstock.

<p/>Every spare minute of the week following her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) return was used by Dick in
accidentally passing the schoolhouse in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) journeys about the
neighbourhood; but not once did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) make herself visible. A handkerchief
belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been providentially found by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mother in clearing
the rooms the day after that of the dance; and by much contrivance Dick
got it handed over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), to leave with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at any time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) should be
near the school after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) return. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) delayed taking the extreme
measure of calling with it lest, had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) really no sentiment of interest
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), it might be regarded as a slightly absurd errand, the reason
guessed; and the sense of the ludicrous, which was rather keen in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), do
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) dignity considerable injury in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes; and what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>),
even apart from the question of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loving, was all the world to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) now.

<p/>But the hour came when the patience of love at twenty-one could endure no
longer. One Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) approached the school with a mild air of
indifference, and had the satisfaction of seeing the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) quest
at the further end of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) garden, trying, by the aid of a spade and
gloves, to root a bramble that had intruded itself there.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) disguised his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) feelings from some suspicious-looking cottage-windows
opposite by endeavouring to appear like a man in a great hurry of
business, who wished to leave the handkerchief and have done with such
trifling errands.

<p/>This endeavour signally failed; for on approaching the gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) found it
locked to keep the children, who were playing `cross-dadder' in the
front, from running into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) private grounds.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could only think of one thing to be done,
which was to shout her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a jerk look</b></font>)</div><p/>The words were uttered with a jerk and a look meant to imply to the
cottages opposite that he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) was now simply one who liked shouting as a
pleasant way of passing his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) time, without any reference to persons in
gardens. The name died away, and the unconscious Miss Day continued
digging and pulling as before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) screwed himself up to enduring the cottage-windows yet more stoically,
and shouted again. Fancy took no notice whatever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) shouted the third time, with desperate vehemence, turning suddenly
about and retiring a little distance, as if it were by no means for his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>)
own pleasure that he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had come.

<p/>This time she (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>), came down the garden, and entered the school at
the back. Footsteps echoed across the interior, the door opened, and
three-quarters of the blooming young schoolmistress's face and figure
stood revealed before him (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>); a slice on her (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) left-hand side being cut off by
the edge of the door. Having surveyed and recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) came to
the gate.

<p/>At sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had the pink of her (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) cheeks increased, lessened, or did it
continue to cover its normal area of ground? It was a question meditated
several hundreds of times by her (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) visitor in after-hours--the meditation,
after wearying involutions, always ending in one way, that it was
impossible to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your handkerchief: Miss Day: I called with.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) held it out
spasmodically and awkwardly. <div class="bookquote">``Mother found it: under a chair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, thank you very much for bringing it, Mr. Dewy. I couldn't think
where I had dropped it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Dick, not being an experienced lover--indeed, never before having
been engaged in the practice of love-making at all, except in a small
schoolboy way--could not take advantage of the situation; and out came
the blunder, which afterwards cost him (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) so many bitter moments and a
sleepless night:-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Miss Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Mr. Dewy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The gate was closed; she (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) was gone; and Dick was standing outside,
unchanged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) condition from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had been before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) called. Of
course the Angel was not to blame--a young woman living alone in a house
could not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) indoors unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) better--he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) should have
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) outside before floundering into that fatal farewell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wished
that before he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) called he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had realized more fully than he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) did the pleasure
of being about to call; and turned away.




<p/>PART THE SECOND--SPRING


<p/>CHAPTER I: PASSING BY THE SCHOOL


<p/>It followed that, as the spring advanced, Dick walked abroad much more
frequently than had hitherto been usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), and was continually
finding that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) nearest way to or from home lay by the road which
skirted the garden of the school. The first-fruits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) perseverance
were that, on turning the angle on the nineteenth journey by that track,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) saw Miss Fancy's figure, clothed in a dark-gray dress, looking from a
high open window upon the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hat. The friendly greeting
resulting from this rencounter was considered so valuable an elixir that
Dick passed still oftener; and by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had almost trodden a little
path under the fence where never a path was before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was rewarded with
an actual meeting face to face on the open road before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) gate. This
brought another meeting, and another, Fancy faintly showing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
bearing that it was a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) of some kind to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) there; but
the sort of pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) derived, whether exultation at the hope her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
exceeding fairness inspired, or the true feeling which was alone Dick's
concern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could not anyhow decide, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) meditated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) every
little movement for hours after it was made.



<p/>CHAPTER II: A MEETING OF THE QUIRE


<p/>It was the evening of a fine spring day. The descending sun appeared as
a nebulous blaze of amber light, its outline being lost in cloudy masses
hanging round it, like wild locks of hair.

<p/>The chief members of Mellstock parish choir were standing in a group in
front of Mr. Penny's workshop in the lower village. They were all
brightly illuminated, and each was backed up by a shadow as long as a
steeple; the lowness of the source of light rendering the brims of their
hats of no use at all as a protection to the eyes.

<p/>Mr. Penny's was the last house in that part of the parish, and stood in a
hollow by the roadside so that cart-wheels and horses' legs were about
level with the sill of his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) shop-window. This was low and wide, and was
open from morning till evening, Mr. Penny himself being invariably seen
working inside, like a framed portrait of a shoemaker by some modern
Moroni. He (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) sat facing the road, with a boot on his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) knees and the awl in
his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) hand, only looking up for a moment as he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) arms and
bent forward at the pull, when his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) spectacles flashed in the passer's
face with a shine of flat whiteness, and then returned again to the boot
as usual. Rows of lasts, small and large, stout and slender, covered the
wall which formed the background, in the extreme shadow of which a kind
of dummy was seen sitting, in the shape of an apprentice with a string
tied round his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) hair -LRB-probably to keep it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) eyes-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) smiled at
remarks that floated in from without, but was never known to answer them
in Mr. Penny's presence. Outside the window the upper-leather of a
Wellington-boot was usually hung, pegged to a board as if to dry. No
sign was over his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) door; in fact--as with old banks and mercantile
houses--advertising in any shape was scorned, and it would have been felt
as beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) dignity to paint up, for the benefit of strangers, the
name of an establishment whose trade came solely by connection based on
personal respect.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) visitors now came and stood on the outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) window, sometimes
leaning against the sill, sometimes moving a pace or two backwards and
forwards in front of it. They talked with deliberate gesticulations to
Mr. Penny, enthroned in the shadow of the interior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like a man to stick to men who be in the same line o' life--o'
Sundays, anyway--that I do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis like all the doings of folk who don't know what a day's work is,
that's what I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My belief is the man's not to blame; `tis she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s the bitter weed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a poor gawk-hammer. Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sermon
yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sermon was well enough, a very good guessable sermon, only he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
couldn't put it into words and speak it. That's all was the matter wi'
the sermon. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't been able to get it past his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--ay, the sermon might have been good; for, `tis true, the sermon of
Old Eccl`iastes himself lay in Eccl`iastes's ink-bottle afore he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got it
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Penny, being in the act of drawing the last stitch tight, could
afford time to look up and throw in a word at this point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s no spouter--that must be said, 'a b`lieve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a terrible muddle sometimes with the man, as far as spout do go,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Spinks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we'll say nothing about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>the tranter answered; <div class="bookquote">``for I don't
believe `twill make a penneth o' difference to we poor martels here or
hereafter whether his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sermons be good or bad, my sonnies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Penny made another hole with his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) awl, pushed in the thread, and
looked up and spoke again at the extension of arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) goings-on, souls, that's what it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) features
for an Herculean addition to the ordinary pull, and continued, <div class="bookquote">``The first
thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came here was to be hot and strong about church
business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Spinks; <div class="bookquote">``that was the very first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Penny, having now been offered the ear of the assembly, accepted it,
ceased stitching, swallowed an unimportant quantity of air as if it were
a pill, and continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do do is to think about altering the church, until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
found `twould be a matter o' cost and what not, and then not to think no
more about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True: that was the next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the next thing was to tell the young chaps that they were not on no
account to put their hats in the christening font during service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then 'twas this, and then 'twas that, and now `tis--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div><p/>Words were not forcible enough to conclude the sentence, and Mr. Penny
gave a huge pull to signify the concluding word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now `tis to turn us out of the quire neck and crop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said the tranter
after an interval of half a minute, not by way of explaining the pause
and pull, which had been quite understood, but as a means of keeping the
subject well before the meeting.

<p/>Mrs. Penny came to the door at this point in the discussion. Like all
good wives, however much she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) was inclined to play the Tory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>)
husband's Whiggism, and vice versa, in times of peace, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) coalesced with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tory</b></font>) heartily enough in time of war.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be owned he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not all there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) replied in a general way to
the fragments of talk she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) had heard from indoors. <div class="bookquote">``Far below poor Mr.
Grinham''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the late vicar-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, there was this to be said for he (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>), that you were quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>)'d
never come mumbudgeting to see ye, just as you were in the middle of your
work, and put you out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>) fuss and trouble about ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never. But as for this new Mr. Maybold, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) mid be a very well-
intending party in that respect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)'s unbearable; for as to sifting your
cinders, scrubbing your floors, or emptying your slops, why, you can't do
it. I assure you I've not been able to empt them for several days,
unless I throw 'em up the chimley or out of winder; for as sure as the
sun you meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) at the door, coming to ask how you are, and `tis such a
confusing thing to meet a gentleman at the door when ye are in the mess
o' washing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis only for want of knowing better, poor gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter.
<div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) meaning's good enough. Ay, your pa`son comes by fate: `tis heads or
tails, like pitch-halfpenny, and no choosing; so we must take en as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
is, my sonnies, and thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s no worse, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) look across at Miss Day in a warmer way than
Christianity asked for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny musingly; <div class="bookquote">``but I don't quite
like to say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no; there's nothing in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said grandfather William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there's nothing, we shall see nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penny replied, in the
tone of a woman who might possibly have private opinions still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Mr. Grinham was the man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Bowman. <div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>) never troubled us
wi' a visit from year's end to year's end. You might go anywhere, do
anything: you'd be sure never to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>) was a right sensible pa`son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>) never entered
our door but once in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>) life, and that was to tell my poor wife--ay,
poor soul, dead and gone now, as we all shall!--that as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was such a'
old aged person, and lived so far from the church, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>) didn't at all
expect her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to come any more to the service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And 'a was a very jinerous gentleman about choosing the psalms and hymns
o' Sundays. ``Confound ye,<div class="bookquote">'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), `blare and scrape what ye will, but
don't bother me!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a very honourable man in not wanting any of us to come and
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) if we were all on-end for a jaunt or spree, or to bring the
babies to be christened if they were inclined to squalling. There's good
in a man's not putting a parish to unnecessary trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there's this here man never letting us have a bit o' peace; but
keeping on about being good and upright till `tis carried to such a pitch
as I never see the like afore nor since!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got here than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found the font wouldn't hold water, as
it hadn't for years off and on; and when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that Mr. Grinham
never minded it, but used to spet upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Grinham</b></font>) vinger and christen 'em just
as well, 'a said, ``Good Heavens! Send for a workman immediate. What
place have I come to!<div class="bookquote">'' Which was no compliment to us, come to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, for my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William, <div class="bookquote">``though he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)'s arrayed against us,
I like the hearty borussnorus ways of the new pa`son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, ready to die for the quire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Bowman reproachfully, <div class="bookquote">``to stick
up for the quire's enemy, William!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bowman/Joseph Bowman/Joseph</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody will feel the loss of our church-work so much as I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old
man firmly; <div class="bookquote">``that you d'all know. I've a-been in the quire man and boy
ever since I was a chiel of eleven. But for all that `tisn't in me to
call the man a bad man, because I truly and sincerely believe en to be a
good young feller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Some of the youthful sparkle that used to reside there animated William's
eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uttered the words, and a certain nobility of aspect was also
imparted to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) by the setting sun, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a Titanic shadow at
least thirty feet in length, stretching away to the east in outlines of
imposing magnitude, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) head finally terminating upon the trunk of a
grand old oak-tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mayble's a hearty feller enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tranter replied, ``and will spak to
you be you dirty or be you clane. The first time I met en was in a
drong, and though 'a didn't know me no more than the dead, 'a passed the
time of day. ``D'ye do?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, says he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) head. ``A fine
day.'' Then the second time I met en was full-buff in town street, when
my breeches were tore into a long strent by getting through a copse of
thorns and brimbles for a short cut home-along; and not wanting to
disgrace the man by spaking in that state, I fixed my eye on the
weathercock to let en pass me as a stranger. But no: ``How d'ye do,
Reuben?<div class="bookquote">'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), right hearty, and shook my hand. If I'd been dressed
in silver spangles from top to toe, the man couldn't have been civiller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment Dick was seen coming up the village-street, and they
turned and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER III: A TURN IN THE DISCUSSION


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid Dick's a lost man,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?--no!''  (<font color='red'><b>commoner</b></font>)</div>said Mail, implying by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) manner that it was a far commoner
thing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) ears to report what was not said than that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) judgment
should be at fault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, still gazing at Dick's unconscious advance. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't at all like what I see! There's too many o' them looks out of the
winder without noticing anything; too much shining of boots; too much
peeping round corners; too much looking at the clock; telling about
clever things she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did till you be sick of it; and then upon a hint to
that effect a horrible silence about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I've walked the path once in
my life and know the country, neighbours; and Dick's a lost man!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
tranter turned a quarter round and smiled a smile of miserable satire at
the setting new moon, which happened to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) eye.

<p/>The others became far too serious at this announcement to allow them to
speak; and they still regarded Dick in the distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">'''Twas his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mother's fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>the tranter continued, ``in asking the young
woman to our party last Christmas. When I eyed the blue frock and light
heels o' the maid, I had my thoughts directly. ``God bless thee, Dicky my
sonny,<div class="bookquote">'' I said to myself; `there's a delusion for thee!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dicky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They seemed to be rather distant in manner last Sunday, I thought?''  (<font color='red'><b>a member</b></font>)</div>Mail
tentatively observed, as became one who was not a member of the family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that's a part of the zickness. Distance belongs to it, slyness
belongs to it, queerest things on earth belongs to it! There, `tmay as
well come early as late s`far as I know. The sooner begun, the sooner
over; for come it will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The question I ask is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Spinks, connecting into one thread the
two subjects of discourse, as became a man learned in rhetoric, and
beating with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand in a way which signified that the manner rather
than the matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech was to be observed, <div class="bookquote">``how did Mr. Maybold
know she (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) could play the organ? You know we had it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) own lips, as
far as lips go, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) has never, first or last, breathed such a thing
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>); much less that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) ever would play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>In the midst of this puzzle Dick joined the party, and the news which had
caused such a convulsion among the ancient musicians was unfolded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, blushing at the allusion to Miss Day, <div class="bookquote">``I know by some
words of hers that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) has a particular wish not to play, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) is
a friend of ours; and how the alteration comes, I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, this is my plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, reviving the spirit of the
discussion by the infusion of new ideas, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) custom--<div class="bookquote">``this is my
plan; if you don't like it, no harm's done. We all know one another very
well, don't we, neighbours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That they knew one another very well was received as a statement which,
though familiar, should not be omitted in introductory speeches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I say this'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spinks/Spinks</b></font>)</div>--and the tranter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) emphasis slapped down his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hand
on Mr. Spinks's shoulder with a momentum of several pounds, upon which
Mr. Spinks tried to look not in the least startled--``I say that we all
move down-along straight as a line to Pa`son Mayble's when the clock has
gone six to-morrow night. There we one and all stand in the passage,
then one or two of us go in and spak to en, man and man; and say, ``Pa`son
Mayble, every tradesman d'like to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayble</b></font>) own way in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayble</b></font>) workshop, and
Mellstock Church is yours. Instead of turning us out neck and crop, let
us stay on till Christmas, and we'll gie way to the young woman, Mr.
Mayble, and make no more ado about it. And we shall always be quite
willing to touch our hats when we meet ye, Mr. Mayble, just as before.<div class="bookquote">''
That sounds very well? Hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mayble/Mayble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proper well, in faith, Reuben Dewy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And we won't sit down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) house; `twould be looking too familiar when
only just reconciled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No need at all to sit down. Just do our duty man and man, turn round,
and march out--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll think all the more of us for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly think Leaf had better go wi' us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael, turning to Leaf
and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) measure from top to bottom by the eye. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s so terrible
silly that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might ruin the concern.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't want to go much; do ye, Thomas Leaf?''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hee-hee! no; I don't want to. Only a teeny bit!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I be mortal afeard, Leaf, that you'll never be able to tell how many
cuts d'take to sharpen a spar,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never had no head, never! that's how it happened to happen, hee-hee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div><p/>They all assented to this, not with any sense of humiliating Leaf by
disparaging him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) after an open confession, but because it was an accepted
thing that Leaf didn't in the least mind having no head, that deficiency
of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) being an unimpassioned matter of parish history.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can sing my treble!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas Leaf/Thomas/Leaf</b></font>)</div>continued Thomas Leaf, quite delighted at
being called a fool in such a friendly way; <div class="bookquote">``I can sing my treble as well
as any maid, or married woman either, and better! And if Jim had lived,
I should have had a clever brother! To-morrow is poor Jim's birthday.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d ha' been twenty-six if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d lived till to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a fool</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You always seem very sorry for Jim,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William musingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I do. Such a stay to mother as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d always ha' been! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d never
have had to work in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old age if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had continued strong, poor Jim!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) age when 'a died?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Four hours and twenty minutes, poor Jim. <div class="bookquote">``A was born as might be at
night; and 'a didn't last as might be till the morning. No, 'a didn't
last. Mother called en Jim on the day that would ha' been his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
christening day if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had lived; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s always thinking about en. You
see he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) died so very young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, 'twas rather youthful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Mail</b></font>)</div>said Michael.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now to my mind that woman is very romantical on the matter o' children?''
 (<font color='red'><b>audience</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) eye sweeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) audience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mid be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said Leaf. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had twelve regular one after
another, and they all, except myself, died very young; either before they
was born or just afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pore feller, too. I suppose th`st want to come wi' us?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tranter
murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Leaf, you shall come wi' us as yours is such a melancholy family,''
 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William rather sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never see such a melancholy family as that afore in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said
Reuben. <div class="bookquote">``There's Leaf's mother, poor woman! Every morning I see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
eyes mooning out through the panes of glass like a pot-sick
winder-flower; and as Leaf sings a very high treble, and we don't know
what we should do without en for upper G, we'll let en come as a trate,
poor feller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, we'll let en come, 'a b`lieve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny, looking up, as the
pull happened to be at that moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>continued the tranter, dispersing by a new tone of voice these
digressions about Leaf; <div class="bookquote">``as to going to see the pa`son, one of us might
call and ask en his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) meaning, and `twould be just as well done; but it
will add a bit of flourish to the cause if the quire waits on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as a
body. Then the great thing to mind is, not for any of our fellers to be
nervous; so before starting we'll one and all come to my house and have a
rasher of bacon; then every man-jack het a pint of cider into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) inside;
then we'll warm up an extra drop wi' some mead and a bit of ginger; every
one take a thimbleful--just a glimmer of a drop, mind ye, no more, to
finish off his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) inner man--and march off to Pa`son Mayble. Why, sonnies,
a man's not himself till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is fortified wi' a bit and a drop? We shall
be able to look any gentleman in the face then without shrink or shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div><p/>Mail recovered from a deep meditation and downward glance into the earth
in time to give a cordial approval to this line of action, and the
meeting adjourned.



<p/>CHAPTER IV: THE INTERVIEW WITH THE VICAR


<p/>At six o'clock the next day, the whole body of men in the choir emerged
from the tranter's door, and advanced with a firm step down the lane.
This dignity of march gradually became obliterated as they went on, and
by the time they reached the hill behind the vicarage a faint resemblance
to a flock of sheep might have been discerned in the venerable party. A
word from the tranter, however, set them right again; and as they
descended the hill, the regular tramp, tramp, tramp of the united feet
was clearly audible from the vicarage garden. At the opening of the gate
there was another short interval of irregular shuffling, caused by a
rather peculiar habit the gate had, when swung open quickly, of striking
against the bank and slamming back into the opener's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now keep step again, will ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``It looks better, and
more becomes the high class of arrant which has brought us here.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Thus
they advanced to the door.

<p/>At Reuben's ring the more modest of the group turned aside, adjusted
their hats, and looked critically at any shrub that happened to lie in
the line of vision; endeavouring thus to give a person who chanced to
look out of the windows the impression that their request, whatever it
was going to be, was rather a casual thought occurring whilst they were
inspecting the vicar's shrubbery and grass-plot than a predetermined
thing. The tranter, who, coming frequently to the vicarage with luggage,
coals, firewood, etc., had none of the awe for its precincts that filled
the breasts of most of the others, fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) eyes firmly on the knocker
during this interval of waiting. The knocker having no characteristic
worthy of notice, he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) relinquished it for a knot in one of the
door-panels, and studied the winding lines of the grain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, sir, please, here's Tranter Dewy, and old William Dewy, and young
Richard Dewy, O, and all the quire too, sir, except the boys, a-come to
see you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Maybold's maid-servant to Mr. Maybold, the pupils of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) eyes dilating like circles in a pond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the choir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>said the astonished vicar -LRB-who may be shortly described
as a good-looking young man with courageous eyes, timid mouth, and
neutral nose-RRB-, abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writing and looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parlour-maid
after speaking, like a man who fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) face before but
couldn't recollect where.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they looks very firm, and Tranter Dewy do turn neither to the right
hand nor to the left, but stares quite straight and solemn with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tranter</b></font>) mind
made up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, all the choir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>repeated the vicar to himself, trying by that simple
device to trot out his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) thoughts on what the choir could come for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; every man-jack of 'em, as I be alive!''  (<font color='red'><b>The parlour-maid</b></font>)</div>-LRB-The parlour-maid was
rather local in manner, having in fact been raised in the same village.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``Really, sir, `tis thoughted by many in town and country that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Town and country!--Heavens, I had no idea that I was public property in
this way!''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar face</b></font>)</div>said the vicar, his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) face acquiring a hue somewhere between
that of the rose and the peony. ``Well, <div class="bookquote">``It is thought in town and
country that--'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is thought that you be going to get it hot and strong!--excusen my
incivility, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>The vicar suddenly recalled to his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) recollection that he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) had long ago
settled it to be decidedly a mistake to encourage his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) servant Jane in
giving personal opinions. The servant Jane saw by the vicar's face that
he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) recalled this fact to his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) mind; and removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) forehead from the
edge of the door, and rubbing away the indent that edge had made,
vanished into the passage as Mr. Maybold remarked, <div class="bookquote">``Show them in, Jane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div><p/>A few minutes later a shuffling and jostling -LRB-reduced to as refined a
form as was compatible with the nature of shuffles and jostles-RRB- was heard
in the passage; then an earnest and prolonged wiping of shoes, conveying
the notion that volumes of mud had to be removed; but the roads being so
clean that not a particle of dirt appeared on the choir's boots -LRB-those of
all the elder members being newly oiled, and Dick's brightly polished-RRB-,
this wiping might have been set down simply as a desire to show that
respectable men had no wish to take a mean advantage of clean roads for
curtailing proper ceremonies. Next there came a powerful whisper from
the same quarter:-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now stand stock-still there, my sonnies, one and all! And don't make no
noise; and keep your backs close to the wall, that company may pass in
and out easy if they want to without squeezing through ye: and we two are
enough to go in.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>... The voice was the tranter's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could go in too and see the sight!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said a reedy voice--that of
Leaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a pity Leaf is so terrible silly, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) might,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never in my life seed a quire go into a study to have it out about the
playing and singing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>pleaded Leaf; <div class="bookquote">``and I should like to see it just
once!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; we'll let en come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be like
chips in porridge, -LCB-1-RCB- Leaf--neither good nor hurt. All right, my sonny,
come along;''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>and immediately himself, old William, and Leaf appeared in
the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We took the liberty to come and see `ee, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>)
hat hang in his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) left hand, and touching with his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) right the brim of an
imaginary one on his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``We've come to see `ee, sir, man and man, and
no offence, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Maybold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This old aged man standing by my side is father; William Dewy by name,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I see it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>said the vicar, nodding aside to old William, who
smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you mightn't know en without his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) bass-viol,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tranter
apologized. <div class="bookquote">``You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) always wears his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) best clothes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) bass-viol
a-Sundays, and it do make such a difference in a' old man's look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who's that young man?''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>the vicar said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell the pa`son yer name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, turning to Leaf, who stood
with his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) elbows nailed back to a bookcase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, Thomas Leaf, your holiness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said Leaf, trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll excuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>) looks being so very thin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>continued the
tranter deprecatingly, turning to the vicar again. <div class="bookquote">``But `tisn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>)
fault, poor feller. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>)'s rather silly by nature, and could never get
fat; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>)'s a' excellent treble, and so we keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>) on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never had no head, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said Leaf, eagerly grasping at this
opportunity for being forgiven his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) existence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor young man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Maybold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't mind it a bit, if you don't, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter
assuringly. <div class="bookquote">``Do ye, Leaf?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I--not a morsel--hee, hee! I was afeard it mightn't please your
holiness, sir, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div><p/>The tranter, finding Leaf get on so very well through his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) negative
qualities, was tempted in a fit of generosity to advance him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) still
higher, by giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) credit for positive ones. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s very clever for a
silly chap, good-now, sir. You never knowed a young feller keep his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>)
smock-frocks so clane; very honest too. His (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) ghastly looks is all there
is against en, poor feller; but we can't help our looks, you know, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True: we cannot. You live with your mother, I think, Leaf?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div><p/>The tranter looked at Leaf to express that the most friendly assistant to
his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) tongue could do no more for him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) now, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) must be left to his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>)
own resources.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir: a widder, sir. Ah, if brother Jim had lived she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d have had a
clever son to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) without work!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! poor woman. Give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) this half-crown. I'll call and see your
mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Say, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir,'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tranter whispered imperatively towards Leaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said Leaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, then; sit down, Leaf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Maybold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Y-yes, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div><p/>The tranter cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) throat after this accidental parenthesis about
Leaf, rectified his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) bodily position, and began his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mayble,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll excuse my common way, but I always
like to look things in the face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Reuben made a point of fixing this sentence in the vicar's mind by gazing
hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) at the conclusion of it, and then out of the window.

<p/>Mr. Maybold and old William looked in the same direction, apparently
under the impression that the things' faces alluded to were there
visible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I have been thinking'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--the tranter implied by this use of the past
tense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) was hardly so discourteous as to be positively thinking it
then--<div class="bookquote">``is that the quire ought to be gie'd a little time, and not done
away wi' till Christmas, as a fair thing between man and man. And, Mr.
Mayble, I hope you'll excuse my common way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, I will. Till Christmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>the vicar murmured, stretching the two
words to a great length, as if the distance to Christmas might be
measured in that way. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I want you all to understand that I have no
personal fault to find, and that I don't wish to change the church music
by forcible means, or in a way which should hurt the feelings of any
parishioners. Why I have at last spoken definitely on the subject is
that a player has been brought under--I may say pressed upon--my notice
several times by one of the churchwardens. And as the organ I brought
with me is here waiting''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to a cabinet-organ standing in the
study-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``there is no reason for longer delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We made a mistake I suppose then, sir? But we understood the young
woman didn't want to play particularly?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The tranter arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)
countenance to signify that he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) did not want to be inquisitive in the
least.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Nor did I definitely wish her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to just yet; for your
playing is very good. But, as I said, one of the churchwardens has been
so anxious for a change, that, as matters stand, I couldn't consistently
refuse my consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>Now for some reason or other, the vicar at this point seemed to have an
idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) had prevaricated; and as an honest vicar, it was a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)
determined not to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) corrected himself, blushing as he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) did so,
though why he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) should blush was not known to Reuben.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Understand me rightly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``the church-warden proposed it to me,
but I had thought myself of getting--Miss Day to play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which churchwarden might that be who proposed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), sir?--excusing my
common way.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The tranter intimated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) tone that, so far from being
inquisitive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) did not even wish to ask a single question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Shiner, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clk, my sonny!--beg your pardon, sir, that's only a form of words of
mine, and slipped out accidental--he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) nourishes enmity against us for some
reason or another; perhaps because we played rather hard upon en
Christmas night. Anyhow `tis certain sure that Mr. Shiner's real love
for music of a particular kind isn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)'ve no more ear than
that chair. But let that be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you should conclude that, because Mr. Shiner wants a
different music, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) has any ill-feeling for you. I myself, I must own,
prefer organ-music to any other. I consider it most proper, and feel
justified in endeavouring to introduce it; but then, although other music
is better, I don't say yours is not good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, Mr. Mayble, since death's to be, we'll die like men any day
you name -LRB-excusing my common way-RRB-.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Maybold bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All we thought was, that for us old ancient singers to be choked off
quiet at no time in particular, as now, in the Sundays after Easter,
would seem rather mean in the eyes of other parishes, sir. But if we
fell glorious with a bit of a flourish at Christmas, we should have a
respectable end, and not dwindle away at some nameless paltry
second-Sunday-after or Sunday-next-before something, that's got no name
of his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, that's reasonable; I own it's reasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Mr. Mayble, we've got--do I keep you inconvenient long, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got our feelings--father there especially.''

 (<font color='red'><b>person</b></font>)</div><p/>The tranter, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) earnestness, had advanced his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) person to within six
inches of the vicar's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, certainly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Maybold, retreating a little for
convenience of seeing. <div class="bookquote">``You are all enthusiastic on the subject, and I
am all the more gratified to find you so. A Laodicean lukewarmness is
worse than wrongheadedness itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly, sir. In fact now, Mr. Mayble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>Reuben continued, more
impressively, and advancing a little closer still to the vicar, <div class="bookquote">``father
there is a perfect figure o' wonder, in the way of being fond of music!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>The vicar drew back a little further, the tranter suddenly also standing
back a foot or two, to throw open the view of his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) father, and pointing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) at the same time.

<p/>Old William moved uneasily in the large chair, and with a minute smile on
the mere edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lips, for good-manners, said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was indeed very fond
of tunes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you see exactly how it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>Reuben continued, appealing to Mr.
Maybold's sense of justice by looking sideways into his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) eyes. The vicar
seemed to see how it was so well that the gratified tranter walked up to
him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) again with even vehement eagerness, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) waistcoat-buttons
almost rubbed against the vicar's as he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) continued: ``As to father, if you
or I, or any man or woman of the present generation, at the time music is
a-playing, was to shake your fist in father's face, as may be this way,
and say, ``Don't you be delighted with that music!'''--the tranter went
back to where Leaf was sitting, and held his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) fist so close to Leaf's face
that the latter pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) head back against the wall: ``All right, Leaf,
my sonny, I won't hurt you; `tis just to show my meaning to Mr.
Mayble.--As I was saying, if you or I, or any man, was to shake your fist
in father's face this way, and say, <div class="bookquote">``William, your life or your music!''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)'d say, <div class="bookquote">``My life!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now that's father's nature all over; and you see,
sir, it must hurt the feelings of a man of that kind for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bass-
viol to be done away wi' neck and crop.''

<p/>The tranter went back to the vicar's front and again looked earnestly at
his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True, true, Dewy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>Mr. Maybold answered, trying to withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) head and
shoulders without moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) feet; but finding this impracticable, edging
back another inch. These frequent retreats had at last jammed Mr.
Maybold between his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) easy-chair and the edge of the table.

<p/>And at the moment of the announcement of the choir, Mr. Maybold had just
re-dipped the pen he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) was using; at their entry, instead of wiping it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)
had laid it on the table with the nib overhanging. At the last retreat
his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) coat-tails came in contact with the pen, and down it rolled, first
against the back of the chair, thence turning a summersault into the
seat, thence falling to the floor with a rattle.

<p/>The vicar stooped for his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) pen, and the tranter, wishing to show that,
however great their ecclesiastical differences, his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) mind was not so small
as to let this affect his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) social feelings, stooped also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you anything else you want to explain to me, Dewy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Maybold from under the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, sir. And, Mr. Mayble, you be not offended? I hope you see our
desire is reason?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter from under the chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite, quite; and I shouldn't think of refusing to listen to such a
reasonable request,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>the vicar replied. Seeing that Reuben had secured
the pen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) vertical position, and added, <div class="bookquote">``You know, Dewy, it
is often said how difficult a matter it is to act up to our convictions
and please all parties. It may be said with equal truth, that it is
difficult for a man of any appreciativeness to have convictions at all.
Now in my case, I see right in you, and right in Shiner. I see that
violins are good, and that an organ is good; and when we introduce the
organ, it will not be that fiddles were bad, but that an organ was
better. That you'll clearly understand, Dewy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will; and thank you very much for such feelings, sir. Piph-h-h-h! How
the blood do get into my head, to be sure, whenever I quat down like
that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben, who having also risen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) feet stuck the pen
vertically in the inkstand and almost through the bottom, that it might
not roll down again under any circumstances whatever.

<p/>Now the ancient body of minstrels in the passage felt their curiosity
surging higher and higher as the minutes passed. Dick, not having much
affection for this errand, soon grew tired, and went away in the
direction of the school. Yet their sense of propriety would probably
have restrained them from any attempt to discover what was going on in
the study had not the vicar's pen fallen to the floor. The conviction
that the movement of chairs, etc., necessitated by the search, could only
have been caused by the catastrophe of a bloody fight beginning,
overpowered all other considerations; and they advanced to the door,
which had only just fallen to. Thus, when Mr. Maybold raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) eyes
after the stooping he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) beheld glaring through the door Mr. Penny in full-
length portraiture, Mail's face and shoulders above Mr. Penny's head,
Spinks's forehead and eyes over Mail's crown, and a fractional part of
Bowman's countenance under Spinks's arm--crescent-shaped portions of
other heads and faces being visible behind these--the whole dozen and odd
eyes bristling with eager inquiry.

<p/>Mr. Penny, as is the case with excitable boot-makers and men, seeing the
vicar look at him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) and hearing no word spoken, thought it incumbent upon
himself to say something of any kind. Nothing suggested itself till he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)
had looked for about half a minute at the vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll excuse my naming of it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) said, regarding with much
commiseration the mere surface of the vicar's face; <div class="bookquote">``but perhaps you
don't know that your chin have bust out a-bleeding where you cut yourself
a-shaving this morning, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, that was the stooping, depend upon't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>the tranter suggested, also
looking with much interest at the vicar's chin. <div class="bookquote">``Blood always will bust
out again if you hang down the member that's been bleeding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/>Old William raised his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) eyes and watched the vicar's bleeding chin
likewise; and Leaf advanced two or three paces from the bookcase,
absorbed in the contemplation of the same phenomenon, with parted lips
and delighted eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Maybold hastily, looking very red, and
brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) chin with his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) hand, then taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) handkerchief and
wiping the place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, sir; all right again now, 'a b`lieve--a mere nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Penny. <div class="bookquote">``A little bit of fur off your hat will stop it in a minute if
it should bust out again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll let `ee have a bit off mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben, to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) good
feeling; <div class="bookquote">``my hat isn't so new as yours, sir, and `twon't hurt mine a
bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; thank you, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>Mr. Maybold again nervously replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">'''Twas rather a deep cut seemingly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Reuben, feeling these to be the
kindest and best remarks he (<font color='blue'><b>Reuben</b></font>) could make.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, no; not particularly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, your hand will shake sometimes a-shaving, and just when it
comes into your head that you may cut yourself, there's the blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been revolving in my mind that question of the time at which we
make the change,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Maybold, <div class="bookquote">``and I know you'll meet me half-way.
I think Christmas-day as much too late for me as the present time is too
early for you. I suggest Michaelmas or thereabout as a convenient time
for both parties; for I think your objection to a Sunday which has no
name is not one of any real weight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir. I suppose mortal men mustn't expect their own way
entirely; and I express in all our names that we'll make shift and be
satisfied with what you say.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tranter touched the brim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)
imaginary hat again, and all the choir did the same. <div class="bookquote">``About Michaelmas,
then, as far as you are concerned, sir, and then we make room for the
next generation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Michaelmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>said the vicar.



<p/>CHAPTER V: RETURNING HOME WARD


<p/><div class="bookquote">'''A took it very well, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mail, as they all walked up the hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) behaved like a man, 'a did so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. ``And I'm glad
we've let en know our minds. And though, beyond that, we ha'n't got much
by going, 'twas worth while. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) won't forget it. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took it very
well. Supposing this tree here was Pa`son Mayble, and I standing here,
and thik gr't stone is father sitting in the easy-chair. ``Dewy,'' says
he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to change the church music in a forcible way.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was very nice o' the man, even though words be wind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proper nice--out and out nice. The fact is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben
confidentially, <div class="bookquote">''`tis how you take a man. Everybody must be managed.
Queens must be managed: kings must be managed; for men want managing
almost as much as women, and that's saying a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis truly!''  (<font color='red'><b>the husbands</b></font>)</div>murmured the husbands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pa`son Mayble and I were as good friends all through it as if we'd been
sworn brothers. Ay, the man's well enough; `tis what's put in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head
that spoils him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that's why we've got to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's really no believing half you hear about people nowadays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless ye, my sonnies! `tisn't the pa`son's move at all. That gentleman
over there''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the tranter nodded in the direction of Shiner's farm-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``is at
the root of the mischty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Shiner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay; and I see what the pa`son don't see. Why, Shiner is for putting
forward that young woman that only last night I was saying was our Dick's
sweet-heart, but I suppose can't be, and making much of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the sight
of the congregation, and thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'ll win her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by showing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) off. Well,
perhaps 'a woll.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the music is second to the woman, the other churchwarden is second
to Shiner, the pa`son is second to the churchwardens, and God A'mighty is
nowhere at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true; and you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>continued Reuben, ``at the very beginning it
put me in a stud as to how to quarrel wi' en. In short, to save my soul,
I couldn't quarrel wi' such a civil man without belying my conscience.
Says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to father there, in a voice as quiet as a lamb's, ``William, you
are a' old aged man, as all shall be, so sit down in my easy-chair, and
rest yourself.<div class="bookquote">'' And down father zot. I could fain ha' laughed at thee,

<p/>A mood of blitheness rarely experienced even by young men was Dick's on
the following Monday morning. It was the week after the Easter holidays,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was journeying along with Smart the mare and the light
spring-cart, watching the damp slopes of the hill-sides as they streamed
in the warmth of the sun, which at this unsettled season shone on the
grass with the freshness of an occasional inspector rather than as an
accustomed proprietor. His (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) errand was to fetch Fancy, and some
additional household goods, from her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) father's house in the neighbouring
parish to her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) dwelling at Mellstock. The distant view was darkly shaded
with clouds; but the nearer parts of the landscape were whitely illumined
by the visible rays of the sun streaming down across the heavy gray shade
behind.

<p/>The tranter had not yet told his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) son of the state of Shiner's heart that
had been suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) by Shiner's movements. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) preferred to let
such delicate affairs right themselves; experience having taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) that
the uncertain phenomenon of love, as it existed in other people, was not
a groundwork upon which a single action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) own life could be founded.

<p/>Geoffrey Day lived in the depths of Yalbury Wood, which formed portion of
one of the outlying estates of the Earl of Wessex, to whom Day was head
game-keeper, timber-steward, and general overlooker for this district.
The wood was intersected by the highway from Casterbridge to London at a
place not far from the house, and some trees had of late years been
felled between its windows and the ascent of Yalbury Hill, to give the
solitary cottager a glimpse of the passers-by.

<p/>It was a satisfaction to walk into the keeper's house, even as a
stranger, on a fine spring morning like the present. A curl of
wood-smoke came from the chimney, and drooped over the roof like a blue
feather in a lady's hat; and the sun shone obliquely upon the patch of
grass in front, which reflected its brightness through the open doorway
and up the staircase opposite, lighting up each riser with a shiny green
radiance, and leaving the top of each step in shade.

<p/>The window-sill of the front room was between four and five feet from the
floor, dropping inwardly to a broad low bench, over which, as well as
over the whole surface of the wall beneath, there always hung a deep
shade, which was considered objectionable on every ground save one,
namely, that the perpetual sprinkling of seeds and water by the caged
canary above was not noticed as an eyesore by visitors. The window was
set with thickly-leaded diamond glazing, formed, especially in the lower
panes, of knotty glass of various shades of green. Nothing was better
known to Fancy than the extravagant manner in which these circular knots
or eyes distorted everything seen through them from the outside--lifting
hats from heads, shoulders from bodies; scattering the spokes of cart-
wheels, and bending the straight fir-trunks into semicircles. The
ceiling was carried by a beam traversing its midst, from the side of
which projected a large nail, used solely and constantly as a peg for
Geoffrey's hat; the nail was arched by a rainbow-shaped stain, imprinted
by the brim of the said hat when it was hung there dripping wet.

<p/>The most striking point about the room was the furniture. This was a
repetition upon inanimate objects of the old principle introduced by
Noah, consisting for the most part of two articles of every sort. The
duplicate system of furnishing owed its existence to the forethought of
Fancy's mother, exercised from the date of Fancy's birthday onwards. The
arrangement spoke for itself: nobody who knew the tone of the household
could look at the goods without being aware that the second set was a
provision for Fancy, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should marry and have a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own.
The most noticeable instance was a pair of green-faced eight-day clocks,
ticking alternately, which were severally two and half minutes and three
minutes striking the hour of twelve, one proclaiming, in Italian
flourishes, Thomas Wood as the name of its maker, and the other--arched
at the top, and altogether of more cynical appearance--that of Ezekiel
Saunders. They were two departed clockmakers of Casterbridge, whose
desperate rivalry throughout their lives was nowhere more emphatically
perpetuated than here at Geoffrey's. These chief specimens of the
marriage provision were supported on the right by a couple of kitchen
dressers, each fitted complete with their cups, dishes, and plates, in
their turn followed by two dumb-waiters, two family Bibles, two warming-
pans, and two intermixed sets of chairs.

<p/>But the position last reached--the chimney-corner--was, after all, the
most attractive side of the parallelogram. It was large enough to admit,
in addition to Geoffrey himself, Geoffrey's wife, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chair, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) work-
table, entirely within the line of the mantel, without danger or even
inconvenience from the heat of the fire; and was spacious enough overhead
to allow of the insertion of wood poles for the hanging of bacon, which
were cloaked with long shreds of soot, floating on the draught like the
tattered banners on the walls of ancient aisles.

<p/>These points were common to most chimney corners of the neighbourhood;
but one feature there was which made Geoffrey's fireside not only an
object of interest to casual aristocratic visitors--to whom every cottage
fireside was more or less a curiosity--but the admiration of friends who
were accustomed to fireplaces of the ordinary hamlet model. This
peculiarity was a little window in the chimney-back, almost over the
fire, around which the smoke crept caressingly when it left the
perpendicular course. The window-board was curiously stamped with black
circles, burnt thereon by the heated bottoms of drinking-cups, which had
rested there after previously standing on the hot ashes of the hearth for
the purpose of warming their contents, the result giving to the ledge the
look of an envelope which has passed through innumerable post-offices.

<p/>Fancy was gliding about the room preparing dinner, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) head inclining now
to the right, now to the left, and singing the tips and ends of tunes
that sprang up in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mind like mushrooms. The footsteps of Mrs. Day
could be heard in the room overhead. Fancy went finally to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father! Dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div><p/>A tall spare figure was seen advancing by the window with periodical
steps, and the keeper entered from the garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) appeared to be a man
who was always looking down, as if trying to recollect something he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) said
yesterday. The surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) face was fissured rather than wrinkled,
and over and under his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) eyes were folds which seemed as a kind of exterior
eyelids. His (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) nose had been thrown backwards by a blow in a poaching
fray, so that when the sun was low and shining in his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) face, people could
see far into his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) head. There was in him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) a quiet grimness, which would in
his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) moments of displeasure have become surliness, had it not been
tempered by honesty of soul, and which was often wrongheadedness because
not allied with subtlety.

<p/>Although not an extraordinarily taciturn man among friends slightly
richer than himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never wasted words upon outsiders, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
trapper Enoch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ideas were seldom conveyed by any other means than nods
and shakes of the head. Their long acquaintance with each other's ways,
and the nature of their labours, rendered words between them almost
superfluous as vehicles of thought, whilst the coincidence of their
horizons, and the astonishing equality of their social views, by
startling the keeper from time to time as very damaging to the theory of
master and man, strictly forbade any indulgence in words as courtesies.

<p/>Behind the keeper came Enoch -LRB-who had been assisting in the garden-RRB- at
the well-considered chronological distance of three minutes--an interval
of non-appearance on the trapper's part not arrived at without some
reflection. Four minutes had been found to express indifference to
indoor arrangements, and simultaneousness had implied too great an
anxiety about meals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A little earlier than usual, Fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>the keeper said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) sat down and
looked at the clocks. <div class="bookquote">``That Ezekiel Saunders o' thine is tearing on
afore Thomas Wood again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I kept in the middle between them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, also looking at the two
clocks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better stick to Thomas,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``There's a healthy beat in
Thomas that would lead a man to swear by en offhand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) is as true as
the town time. How is it your stap-mother isn't here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>As Fancy was about to reply, the rattle of wheels was heard, and <div class="bookquote">``Weh-
hey, Smart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dewy/Richard/Richard Dewy</b></font>)</div>in Mr. Richard Dewy's voice rolled into the cottage from
round the corner of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo! there's Dewy's cart come for thee, Fancy--Dick driving--afore
time, too. Well, ask the lad to have pot-luck with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick on entering made a point of implying by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) general bearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
took an interest in Fancy simply as in one of the same race and country
as himself; and they all sat down. Dick could have wished her (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) manner had
not been so entirely free from all apparent consciousness of those
accidental meetings of theirs: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) let the thought pass. Enoch sat
diagonally at a table afar off, under the corner cupboard, and drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>)
cider from a long perpendicular pint cup, having tall fir-trees done in
brown on its sides. He (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) threw occasional remarks into the general tide of
conversation, and with this advantage to himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) participated in
the pleasures of a talk -LRB-slight as it was-RRB- at meal-times, without
saddling himself with the responsibility of sustaining it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't your stap-mother come down, Fancy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey. <div class="bookquote">``You'll
excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), Mister Dick, she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'s a little queer sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,--quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dewy/Richard/Richard Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Richard, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) were in the habit of excusing
people every day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) d'belong to that class of womankind that become second wives: a rum
class rather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, with sympathy for an indefinite something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and `tis trying to a female, especially if you've been a first
wife, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hev.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very trying it must be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: you see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) first husband was a young man, who let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) go too far;
in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) used to kick up Bob's-a-dying at the least thing in the
world. And when I'd married her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and found it out, I thought, thinks I,
'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>`Tis too late now to begin to cure `e;' and so I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) bide. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>)'s queer,--very queer, at times!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to hear that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: there; wives be such a provoking class o' society, because though
they be never right, they be never more than half wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Fancy seemed uneasy under the infliction of this household moralizing,
which might tend to damage the airy-fairy nature that Dick, as maiden
shrewdness told her (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>), had accredited her (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) with. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) dead silence impressed
Geoffrey with the notion that something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) words did not agree with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) educated ideas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) changed the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Fred Shiner send the cask o' drink, Fancy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) did: O yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nice solid feller, Fred Shiner!''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey to Dick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) helped
himself to gravy, bringing the spoon round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) plate by way of the
potato-dish, to obviate a stain on the cloth in the event of a spill.

<p/>Now Geoffrey's eyes had been fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) plate for the previous four
or five minutes, and in removing them he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) had only carried them to the
spoon, which, from its fulness and the distance of its transit,
necessitated a steady watching through the whole of the route. Just as
intently as the keeper's eyes had been fixed on the spoon, Fancy's had
been fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) father's, without premeditation or the slightest phase
of furtiveness; but there they were fastened. This was the reason why:

<p/>Dick was sitting next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) on the right side, and on the side of the
table opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) father. Fancy had laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) right hand lightly down
upon the table-cloth for an instant, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) alarm Dick, after
dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) fork and brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) forehead as a reason, flung down his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
own left hand, overlapping a third of Fancy's with it, and keeping it
there. So the innocent Fancy, instead of pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) hand from the trap,
settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) father's, to guard against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) discovery of this
perilous game of Dick's. Dick finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mouthful; Fancy finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)
crumb, and nothing was done beyond watching Geoffrey's eyes. Then the
hands slid apart; Fancy's going over six inches of cloth, Dick's over
one. Geoffrey's eye had risen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said Fred Shiner is a nice solid feller,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) repeated, more
emphatically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) is; yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>stammered Dick; <div class="bookquote">``but to me he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) is little more than a
stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, sure. Now I know en as well as any man can be known. And you know
en very well too, don't ye, Fancy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div><p/>Geoffrey put on a tone expressing that these words signified at present
about one hundred times the amount of meaning they conveyed literally.

<p/>Dick looked anxious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you pass me some bread?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy in a flurry, the red of her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)
face becoming slightly disordered, and looking as solicitous as a human
being could look about a piece of bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>replied the unconscious Geoffrey. <div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) continued,
returning to the displaced idea, <div class="bookquote">``we are likely to remain friendly wi'
Mr. Shiner if the wheels d'run smooth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An excellent thing--a very capital thing, as I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>the youth
answered with exceeding relevance, considering that his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) thoughts, instead
of following Geoffrey's remark, were nestling at a distance of about two
feet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) left the whole time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A young woman's face will turn the north wind, Master Richard: my heart
if `twon't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>Dick looked more anxious and was attentive in earnest at
these words. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; turn the north wind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>added Geoffrey after an
impressive pause. <div class="bookquote">``And though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s one of my own flesh and blood ...
''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you fetch down a bit of raw-mil' cheese from pantry-shelf?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Fancy
interrupted, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) were famishing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that I will, chiel; chiel, says I, and Mr. Shiner only asking last
Saturday night ... cheese you said, Fancy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick controlled his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) emotion at these mysterious allusions to Mr.
Shiner,--the better enabled to do so by perceiving that Fancy's heart
went not with her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) father's--and spoke like a stranger to the affairs of
the neighbourhood. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, there's a great deal to be said upon the power
of maiden faces in settling your courses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) ventured, as the keeper
retreated for the cheese.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The conversation is taking a very strange turn: nothing that I have ever
done warrants such things being said!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>murmured Fancy with emphasis, just
loud enough to reach Dick's ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think to yourself, 'twas to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Enoch</b></font>)</div>cried Enoch from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) distant
corner, by way of filling up the vacancy caused by Geoffrey's momentary
absence. <div class="bookquote">``And so you marry her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), Master Dewy, and there's an end o`t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Enoch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't say such things, Enoch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Enoch</b></font>)</div>came from Fancy severely, upon which
Enoch relapsed into servitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we be doomed to marry, we marry; if we be doomed to remain single, we
do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>replied Dick.

<p/>Geoffrey had by this time sat down again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) now made his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) lips thin
by severely straining them across his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) gums, and looked out of the window
along the vista to the distant highway up Yalbury Hill. <div class="bookquote">``That's not the
case with some folk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) said at length, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) read the words on a
board at the further end of the vista.

<p/>Fancy looked interested, and Dick said, <div class="bookquote">``No?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's that wife o' mine. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doom to be nobody's wife at all
in the wide universe. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would, and did
it twice over. Doom? Doom is nothing beside a elderly woman--quite a
chiel in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A movement was now heard along the upstairs passage, and footsteps
descending. The door at the foot of the stairs opened, and the second
Mrs. Day appeared in view, looking fixedly at the table as she (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) advanced
towards it, with apparent obliviousness of the presence of any other
human being than herself. In short, if the table had been the
personages, and the persons the table, her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) glance would have been the
most natural imaginable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) showed herself to possess an ordinary woman's face, iron-grey hair,
hardly any hips, and a great deal of cleanliness in a broad white apron-
string, as it appeared upon the waist of her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) dark stuff dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People will run away with a story now, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) began saying,
<div class="bookquote">``that Jane Day's tablecloths are as poor and ragged as any union
beggar's!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick now perceived that the tablecloth was a little the worse for wear,
and reflecting for a moment, concluded that `people' in step-mother
language probably meant himself. On lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) found that Mrs.
Day had vanished again upstairs, and presently returned with an armful of
new damask-linen tablecloths, folded square and hard as boards by long
compression. These she (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) flounced down into a chair; then took one, shook
it out from its folds, and spread it on the table by instalments,
transferring the plates and dishes one by one from the old to the new
cloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I suppose they'll say, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ha'n't a decent knife and fork
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't say any such ill-natured thing, I am sure--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>began Dick. But
Mrs. Day had vanished into the next room. Fancy appeared distressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very strange woman, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey, quietly going on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)
dinner. <div class="bookquote">``But `tis too late to attempt curing. My heart! `tis so growed
into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that `twould kill her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to take it out. Ay, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s very queer:
you'd be amazed to see what valuable goods we've got stowed away
upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>carver</b></font>)</div><p/>Back again came Mrs. Day with a box of bright steel horn-handled knives,
silver-plated forks, carver, and all complete. These were wiped of the
preservative oil which coated them, and then a knife and fork were laid
down to each individual with a bang, the carving knife and fork thrust
into the meat dish, and the old ones they had hitherto used tossed away.

<p/>Geoffrey placidly cut a slice with the new knife and fork, and asked Dick
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) wanted any more.

<p/>The table had been spread for the mixed midday meal of dinner and tea,
which was common among frugal countryfolk. <div class="bookquote">``The parishioners about
here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Day, not looking at any living being, but snatching
up the brown delf tea-things, <div class="bookquote">``are the laziest, gossipest, poachest,
jailest set of any ever I came among. And they'll talk about my teapot
and tea-things next, I suppose!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) vanished with the teapot, cups, and
saucers, and reappeared with a tea-service in white china, and a packet
wrapped in brown paper. This was removed, together with folds of tissue-
paper underneath; and a brilliant silver teapot appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll help to put the things right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy soothingly, and rising
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to have laid out better things, I suppose. But''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-here she (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) enlarged her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) looks so as to include Dick-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I have been away
from home a good deal, and I make shocking blunders in my housekeeping.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>Smiles and suavity were then dispensed all around by this bright little
bird.

<p/>After a little more preparation and modification, Mrs. Day took her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) seat
at the head of the table, and during the latter or tea division of the
meal, presided with much composure. It may cause some surprise to learn
that, now her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) vagary was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) showed herself to be an excellent
person with much common sense, and even a religious seriousness of tone
on matters pertaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) afflictions.



<p/>CHAPTER VII: DICK MAKES HIMSELF USEFUL


<p/>The effect of Geoffrey's incidental allusions to Mr. Shiner was to
restrain a considerable flow of spontaneous chat that would otherwise
have burst from young Dewy along the drive homeward. And a certain
remark he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) had hazarded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>), in rather too blunt and eager a manner,
kept the young lady herself even more silent than Dick. On both sides
there was an unwillingness to talk on any but the most trivial subjects,
and their sentences rarely took a larger form than could be expressed in
two or three words.

<p/>Owing to Fancy being later in the day than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had promised, the
charwoman had given up expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); whereupon Dick could do no less
than stay and see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) comfortably tided over the disagreeable time of
entering and establishing herself in an empty house after an absence of a
week. The additional furniture and utensils that had been brought -LRB-a
canary and cage among the rest-RRB- were taken out of the vehicle, and the
horse was unharnessed and put in the plot opposite, where there was some
tender grass. Dick lighted the fire already laid; and activity began to
loosen their tongues a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, <div class="bookquote">``we forgot to bring the fire-irons!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had originally found in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sitting-room, to bear out the expression
`nearly furnished' which the school-manager had used in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) letter to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), a table, three chairs, a fender, and a piece of carpet. This
`nearly' had been supplemented hitherto by a kind friend, who had lent
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fire-irons and crockery until she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should fetch some from home.

<p/>Dick attended to the young lady's fire, using his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) whip-handle for a poker
till it was spoilt, and then flourishing a hurdle stick for the remainder
of the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The kettle boils; now you shall have a cup of tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, diving
into the hamper she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had brought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, whose drive had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) ready for some,
especially in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, here's only one cup-and-saucer, as I breathe! Whatever could
mother be thinking about? Do you mind making shift, Mr. Dewy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, Miss Day,''  (<font color='red'><b>person</b></font>)</div>said that civil person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--And only having a cup by itself? or a saucer by itself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>person</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind in the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which do you mean by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean the cup, if you like the saucer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the saucer, if I like the cup?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly, Miss Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Dewy, for I like the cup decidedly. Stop a minute; there
are no spoons now!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dived into the hamper again, and at the end of
two or three minutes looked up and said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you don't mind if I
can't find a spoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dewy/Richard/Richard Dewy</b></font>)</div>said the agreeable Richard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is, the spoons have slipped down somewhere; right under the
other things. O yes, here's one, and only one. You would rather have
one than not, I suppose, Mr. Dewy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather not. I never did care much about spoons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll have it. I do care about them. You must stir up your tea
with a knife. Would you mind lifting the kettle off, that it may not
boil dry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick leapt to the fireplace, and earnestly removed the kettle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! you did it so wildly that you have made your hand black. We
always use kettle-holders; didn't you learn housewifery as far as that,
Mr. Dewy? Well, never mind the soot on your hand. Come here. I am
going to rinse mine, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They went to a basin she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had placed in the back room. <div class="bookquote">``This is the only
basin I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Turn up your sleeves, and by that time my
hands will be washed, and you can come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands were in the water now. <div class="bookquote">``O, how vexing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exclaimed.
<div class="bookquote">``There's not a drop of water left for you, unless you draw it, and the
well is I don't know how many furlongs deep; all that was in the pitcher
I used for the kettle and this basin. Do you mind dipping the tips of
your fingers in the same?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. And to save time I won't wait till you have done, if you
have no objection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Thereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) plunged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hands, and they paddled together. It being
the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) life that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had touched female fingers under
water, Dick duly registered the sensation as rather a nice one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, I hardly know which are my own hands and which are yours, they
have got so mixed up together,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own very
suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, <div class="bookquote">``at least as far as I am
concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There! no towel! Whoever thinks of a towel till the hands are wet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Nobody.' How very dull it is when people are so friendly! Come here,
Mr. Dewy. Now do you think you could lift the lid of that box with your
elbow, and then, with something or other, take out a towel you will find
under the clean clothes? Be sure don't touch any of them with your wet
hands, for the things at the top are all Starched and Ironed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick managed, by the aid of a knife and fork, to extract a towel from
under a muslin dress without wetting the latter; and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
ventured to assume a tone of criticism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear for that dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, as they wiped their hands together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Day, looking into the box at the dress alluded to. <div class="bookquote">``O,
I know what you mean--that the vicar will never let me wear muslin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I know it is condemned by all orders in the church as flaunting,
and unfit for common wear for girls who've their living to get; but we'll
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the interest of the church, I hope you don't speak seriously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do; but we'll see.''  (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div>There was a comely determination on her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lip,
very pleasant to a beholder who was neither bishop, priest, nor deacon.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I can manage any vicar's views about me if he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)'s under forty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick rather wished she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had never thought of managing vicars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly shall be glad to get some of your delicious tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said in
rather a free way, yet modestly, as became one in a position between that
of visitor and inmate, and looking wistfully at his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) lonely saucer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So shall I. Now is there anything else we want, Mr Dewy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really think there's nothing else, Miss Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) prepared to sit down, looking musingly out of the window at Smart's
enjoyment of the rich grass. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody seems to care about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
murmured, with large lost eyes fixed upon the sky beyond Smart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Mr. Shiner does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, in the tone of a slightly injured
man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I forgot--he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) does, I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>Dick precipitately regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
had suggested Shiner, since it had produced such a miserable result as
this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll warrant you'll care for somebody very much indeed another day,
won't you, Mr. Dewy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) continued, looking very feelingly into the
mathematical centre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I'll warrant I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, feelingly too, and looking back
into her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) dark pupils, whereupon they were turned aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) went on, preventing him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) from speaking just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was going
to narrate a forcible story about his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) feelings; <div class="bookquote">``I meant that nobody
comes to see if I have returned--not even the vicar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>), I'll call at the vicarage directly we have had
some tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! Don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) come down here, whatever you do, whilst I am in
such a state of disarrangement. Parsons look so miserable and awkward
when one's house is in a muddle; walking about, and making impossible
suggestions in quaint academic phrases till your flesh creeps and you
wish them dead. Do you take sugar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Maybold was at this instant seen coming up the path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! That's he (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) coming! How I wish you were not here!--that is, how
awkward--dear, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) exclaimed, with a quick ascent of blood to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
face, and irritated with Dick rather than the vicar, as it seemed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't be alarmed on my account, Miss Day--good-afternoon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said
Dick in a huff, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hat, and leaving the room hastily by the
back-door.

<p/>The horse was caught and put in, and on mounting the shafts to start he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
saw through the window the vicar, standing upon some books piled in a
chair, and driving a nail into the wall; Fancy, with a demure glance,
holding the canary-cage up to him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) life
thought of anything but vicars and canaries.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII: DICK MEETS HIS (<font color='blue'><b>DICK</b></font>) FATHER


<p/>For several minutes Dick drove along homeward, with the inner eye of
reflection so anxiously set on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) passages at arms with Fancy, that the
road and scenery were as a thin mist over the real pictures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mind.
Was she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) a coquette? The balance between the evidence that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) did love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) and that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) did not was so nicely struck, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) opinion had no
stability. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had let him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hand upon hers; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
gaze to drop plumb into the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) into hers--three or four
times; her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) manner had been very free with regard to the basin and towel;
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had appeared vexed at the mention of Shiner. On the other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) about the house like a quiet dog or cat, said Shiner cared
for her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and seemed anxious that Mr. Maybold should do the same.

<p/>Thinking thus as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) neared the handpost at Mellstock Cross, sitting on
the front board of the spring cart--his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) legs on the outside, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)
whole frame jigging up and down like a candle-flame to the time of
Smart's trotting--who should he (<font color='blue'><b>Smart</b></font>) see coming down the hill but his (<font color='blue'><b>Smart</b></font>) father
in the light wagon, quivering up and down on a smaller scale of shakes,
those merely caused by the stones in the road. They were soon crossing
each other's front.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Weh-hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter to Smiler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Weh-hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick to Smart, in an echo of the same voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Th`st hauled her (<font color='blue'><b>Parsons</b></font>) back, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>Reuben inquired peaceably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, with such a clinching period at the end that it seemed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was never going to add another word. Smiler, thinking this the close
of the conversation, prepared to move on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Weh-hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``I tell thee what it is, Dick. That there
maid is taking up thy thoughts more than's good for thee, my sonny.
Thou`rt never happy now unless th`rt making thyself miserable about her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
in one way or another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick rather stupidly.

<p/>``But I do--Wey, Smiler!--<div class="bookquote">``Od rot the women, `tis nothing else wi' 'em
nowadays but getting young men and leading 'em astray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, father! you just repeat what all the common world says; that's all
you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The world's a very sensible feller on things in jineral, Dick; very
sensible indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick looked into the distance at a vast expanse of mortgaged estate. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish I was as rich as a squire when he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)'s as poor as a crow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) murmured;
<div class="bookquote">``I'd soon ask Fancy something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish so too, wi' all my heart, sonny; that I do. Well, mind what
beest about, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Smart</b></font>)</div><p/>Smart moved on a step or two. <div class="bookquote">``Supposing now, father,--We-hey, Smart!--I
did think a little about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and I had a chance, which I ha'n't; don't
you think she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a very good sort of--of--one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, good; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s good enough. When you've made up your mind to marry,
take the first respectable body that comes to hand--she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s as good as any
other; they be all alike in the groundwork; `tis only in the flourishes
there's a difference. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s good enough; but I can't see what the nation
a young feller like you--wi' a comfortable house and home, and father and
mother to take care o' thee, and who sent `ee to a school so good that
'twas hardly fair to the other children--should want to go hollering
after a young woman for, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s quietly making a husband in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
pocket, and not troubled by chick nor chiel, to make a poverty-stric'
wife and family of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and neither hat, cap, wig, nor waistcoat to set
'em up with: be drowned if I can see it, and that's the long and the
short o`t, my sonny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick looked at Smart's ears, then up the hill; but no reason was
suggested by any object that met his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) gaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For about the same reason that you did, father, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dang it, my sonny, thou`st got me there!''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>And the tranter gave vent to
a grim admiration, with the mien of a man who was too magnanimous not to
appreciate artistically a slight rap on the knuckles, even if they were
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether or no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, <div class="bookquote">``I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a thing going along the road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to that, is it? Turk! won't thy mother be in a taking! Well,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s ready, I don't doubt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anything about having me; and if you'll let me speak,
I'll tell `ee what I want to know. I just said, Did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) care about me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Piph-ph-ph!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said nothing for a quarter of a mile, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
didn't know. Now, what I want to know is, what was the meaning of that
speech?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The latter words were spoken resolutely, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) didn't care
for the ridicule of all the fathers in creation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The meaning of that speech is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tranter replied deliberately, <div class="bookquote">``that
the meaning is meant to be rather hid at present. Well, Dick, as an
honest father to thee, I don't pretend to deny what you d'know well
enough; that is, that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father being rather better in the pocket than
we, I should welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ready enough if it must be somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what d'ye think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) really did mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said the unsatisfied Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afeard I am not o' much account in guessing, especially as I was not
there when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said it, and seeing that your mother was the only `ooman I
ever cam' into such close quarters as that with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did mother say to you when you asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick musingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that that will help `ee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The principle is the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well--ay: what did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) say? Let's see. I was oiling my working-day
boots without taking 'em off, and wi' my head hanging down, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) just
brushed on by the garden hatch like a flittering leaf. ``Ann,<div class="bookquote">'' I said,
says I, and then,--but, Dick I'm afeard `twill be no help to thee; for we
were such a rum couple, your mother and I, leastways one half was, that
is myself--and your mother's charms was more in the manner than the
material.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ann</b></font>)</div><p/>``Never mind! ``Ann,<div class="bookquote">'' said you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ann</b></font>)</div><p/>''`Ann,' said I, as I was saying ... ``Ann,'' I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) when I was
oiling my working-day boots wi' my head hanging down, ``Woot hae me?'' . .
. What came next I can't quite call up at this distance o' time. Perhaps
your mother would know,--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s got a better memory for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little
triumphs than I. However, the long and the short o' the story is that we
were married somehow, as I found afterwards. <div class="bookquote">``Twas on White
Tuesday,--Mellstock Club walked the same day, every man two and two, and
a fine day 'twas,--hot as fire,--how the sun did strike down upon my back
going to church! I well can mind what a bath o' sweating I was in, body
and soul! But Fance will ha' thee, Dick--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) won't walk with another
chap--no such good luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, whipping at Smart's flank in a
fanciful way, which, as Smart knew, meant nothing in connection with
going on. <div class="bookquote">``There's Pa`son Maybold, too--that's all against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)'s never been stuffing into thy innocent heart that

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) called, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in such a way, and at me
in such a way--quite different the ways were,--and as I was coming off,
there was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hanging up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) birdcage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, why shouldn't the man hang up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) bird-cage? Turk seize it all,

I don't say, but if thou beestn't as mad as a cappel-faced bull, let me

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, ay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's think now, Dick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's another pretty kettle o' fish for thee. Who d'ye think's the
bitter weed in our being turned out? Did our party tell `ee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Why, Pa`son Maybold, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shiner,--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)'s in love with thy young woman, and d'want to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) young figure sitting up at that queer instrument, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) young
fingers rum-strumming upon the keys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>A sharp ado of sweet and bitter was going on in Dick during this
communication from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Shiner's a fool!--no, that's not it; I
don't believe any such thing, father. Why, Shiner would never take a

it kindly. Pooh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's to say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has done as much to he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--rot 'em! Now, Dick, this is how a maid
is. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'ll swear she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s dying for thee, and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) is dying for thee, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) will die for thee; but she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'ll fling a look over t`other shoulder at
another young feller, though never leaving off dying for thee just the
same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s not dying for me, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) didn't fling a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) may be dying for him (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) looked at thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to make of it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick gloomily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I can make of it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the tranter said, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) whip, arranging
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) different joints and muscles, and motioning to the horse to move on,
<div class="bookquote">``that if you can't read a maid's mind by her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) motions, nature d'seem to
say thou`st ought to be a bachelor. Clk, clk! Smiler!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the tranter
moved on.

<p/>Dick held Smart's rein firmly, and the whole concern of horse, cart, and
man remained rooted in the lane. How long this condition would have
lasted is unknown, had not Dick's thoughts, after adding up numerous
items of misery, gradually wandered round to the fact that as something
must be done, it could not be done by staying there all night.

<p/>Reaching home he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) bedroom, shut the door as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) were
going to be seen no more in this life, and taking a sheet of paper and
uncorking the ink-bottle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) began a letter. The dignity of the writer's
mind was so powerfully apparent in every line of this effusion that it
obscured the logical sequence of facts and intentions to an appreciable
degree; and it was not at all clear to a reader whether he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) there and then
left off loving Miss Fancy Day; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had never loved her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) seriously,
and never meant to; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had been dying up to the present moment,
and now intended to get well again; or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had hitherto been in
good health, and intended to die for her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) forthwith.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) put this letter in an envelope, sealed it up, directed it in a stern
handwriting of straight dashes--easy flourishes being rigorously
excluded. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) walked with it in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) pocket down the lane in strides not
an inch less than three feet long. Reaching her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) gate he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) put on a
resolute expression--then put it off again, turned back homeward, tore up
his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) letter, and sat down.

<p/>That letter was altogether in a wrong tone--that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) must own. A
heartless man-of-the-world tone was what the juncture required. That he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
rather wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), and rather did not want her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)--the latter for choice;
but that as a member of society he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) didn't mind making a query in jaunty
terms, which could only be answered in the same way: did she (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) mean
anything by her (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) bearing towards him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>), or did she (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) not?

<p/>This letter was considered so satisfactory in every way that, being put
into the hands of a little boy, and the order given that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was to run
with it to the school, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was told in addition not to look behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) if
Dick called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) to bring it back, but to run along with it just the
same. Having taken this precaution against vacillation, Dick watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
messenger down the road, and turned into the house whistling an air in
such ghastly jerks and starts, that whistling seemed to be the act the
very furthest removed from that which was instinctive in such a youth.

<p/>The letter was left as ordered: the next morning came and passed--and no
answer. The next. The next. Friday night came. Dick resolved that if
no answer or sign were given by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) the next day, on Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) would meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) face to face, and have it all out by word of mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) father, coming in from the garden at that moment--in
each hand a hive of bees tied in a cloth to prevent their egress--<div class="bookquote">``I
think you'd better take these two swarms of bees to Mrs. Maybold's to-
morrow, instead o' me, and I'll go wi' Smiler and the wagon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a relief; for Mrs. Maybold, the vicar's mother, who had just taken
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) head a fancy for keeping bees -LRB-pleasantly disguised under the
pretence of its being an economical wish to produce her (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) own honey-RRB-, lived
near the watering-place of Budmouth-Regis, ten miles off, and the
business of transporting the hives thither would occupy the whole day,
and to some extent annihilate the vacant time between this evening and
the coming Sunday. The best spring-cart was washed throughout, the axles
oiled, and the bees placed therein for the journey.




<p/>PART THE THIRD--SUMMER


<p/>CHAPTER I: DRIVING OUT OF BUDMOUTH


<p/>An easy bend of neck and graceful set of head; full and wavy bundles of
dark-brown hair; light fall of little feet; pretty devices on the skirt
of the dress; clear deep eyes; in short, a bunch of sweets: it was Fancy!
Dick's heart went round to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with a rush.

<p/>The scene was the corner of Mary Street in Budmouth-Regis, near the
King's statue, at which point the white angle of the last house in the
row cut perpendicularly an embayed and nearly motionless expanse of salt
water projected from the outer ocean--to-day lit in bright tones of green
and opal. Dick and Smart had just emerged from the street, and there on
the right, against the brilliant sheet of liquid colour, stood Fancy Day;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned and recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).

<p/>Dick suspended his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) thoughts of the letter and wonder at how she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came
there by driving close to the chains of the Esplanade--incontinently
displacing two chairmen, who had just come to life for the summer in new
clean shirts and revivified clothes, and being almost displaced in turn
by a rigid boy rattling along with a baker's cart, and looking neither to
the right nor the left. He (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were going to Mellstock that
night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm waiting for the carrier,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) replied, seeming, too, to suspend
thoughts of the letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I can drive you home nicely, and you save half an hour. Will ye
come with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>As Fancy's power to will anything seemed to have departed in some
mysterious manner at that moment, Dick settled the matter by getting out
and assisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) into the vehicle without another word.

<p/>The temporary flush upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheek changed to a lesser hue, which was
permanent, and at length their eyes met; there was present between them a
certain feeling of embarrassment, which arises at such moments when all
the instinctive acts dictated by the position have been performed. Dick,
being engaged with the reins, thought less of this awkwardness than did
Fancy, who had nothing to do but to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) presence, and to be more and
more conscious of the fact, that by accepting a seat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) in this
way she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) succumbed to the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) note. Smart jogged along, and Dick
jogged, and the helpless Fancy necessarily jogged, too; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in a measure captured and made a prisoner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so much obliged to you for your company, Miss Day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) observed, as
they drove past the two semicircular bays of the Old Royal Hotel, where
His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) Majesty King George the Third had many a time attended the balls of
the burgesses.

<p/>To Miss Day, crediting him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with the same consciousness of mastery--a
consciousness of which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was perfectly innocent--this remark sounded
like a magnanimous intention to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), the captive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't come for the pleasure of obliging you with my company,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
said.

<p/>The answer had an unexpected manner of incivility in it that must have
been rather surprising to young Dewy. At the same time it may be
observed, that when a young woman returns a rude answer to a young man's
civil remark, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart is in a state which argues rather hopefully for
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) case than otherwise.

<p/>There was silence between them till they had left the sea-front and
passed about twenty of the trees that ornamented the road leading up out
of the town towards Casterbridge and Mellstock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though I didn't come for that purpose either, I would have done it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick at the twenty-first tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Dewy, no flirtation, because it's wrong, and I don't wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick seated himself afresh just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had been sitting before, arranged
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) looks very emphatically, and cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, anybody would think you had met me on business and were just
going to commence,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady intractably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you never have, to be sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a shaky beginning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) chopped round, and said cheerily, as a
man who had resolved never to spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) jollity by loving one of
womankind--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how are you getting on, Miss Day, at the present time? Gaily, I
don't doubt for a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>womankind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not gay, Dick; you know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gaily doesn't mean decked in gay dresses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't suppose gaily was gaily dressed. Mighty me, what a scholar
you've grown!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lots of things have happened to you this spring, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you seen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, nothing; I've heard, I mean!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you heard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The name of a pretty man, with brass studs and a copper ring and a tin
watch-chain, a little mixed up with your own. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a very unkind picture of Mr. Shiner, for that's who you mean! The
studs are gold, as you know, and it's a real silver chain; the ring I
can't conscientiously defend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) only wore it once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) might have worn it a hundred times without showing it half so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)'s nothing to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) serenely observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not any more than I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Dewy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy severely, <div class="bookquote">``certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) isn't any more to me
than you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked aside to consider the precise compass of that question. <div class="bookquote">``That
I can't exactly answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) replied with soft archness.

<p/>As they were going rather slowly, another spring-cart, containing a
farmer, farmer's wife, and farmer's man, jogged past them; and the
farmer's wife and farmer's man eyed the couple very curiously. The
farmer never looked up from the horse's tail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't you exactly answer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, quickening Smart a little, and
jogging on just behind the farmer and farmer's wife and man.

<p/>As no answer came, and as their eyes had nothing else to do, they both
contemplated the picture presented in front, and noticed how the farmer's
wife sat flattened between the two men, who bulged over each end of the
seat to give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room, till they almost sat upon their respective wheels;
and they looked too at the farmer's wife's silk mantle, inflating itself
between her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shoulders like a balloon and sinking flat again, at each jog
of the horse. The farmer's wife, feeling their eyes sticking into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
back, looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shoulder. Dick dropped ten yards further behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy, why can't you answer?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because how much you are to me depends upon how much I am to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in low tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hand towards hers, and casting
emphatic eyes upon the upper curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Richard Dewy, no touching me! I didn't say in what way your
thinking of me affected the question--perhaps inversely, don't you see?
No touching, sir! Look; goodness me, don't, Dick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>The cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sudden start was the unpleasant appearance over Dick's
right shoulder of an empty timber-wagon and four journeymen-carpenters
reclining in lazy postures inside it, their eyes directed upwards at
various oblique angles into the surrounding world, the chief object of
their existence being apparently to criticize to the very backbone and
marrow every animate object that came within the compass of their vision.
This difficulty of Dick's was overcome by trotting on till the wagon and
carpenters were beginning to look rather misty by reason of a film of
dust that accompanied their wagon-wheels, and rose around their heads
like a fog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say you love me, Fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Dick, certainly not; `tisn't time to do that yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Fancy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Miss Day' is better at present--don't mind my saying so; and I ought
not to have called you Dick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! when you know that I would do anything on earth for your love.
Why, you make any one think that loving is a thing that can be done and
undone, and put on and put off at a mere whim.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said gently; <div class="bookquote">``but there are things which tell me I
ought not to give way to much thinking about you, even if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you want to, don't you? Yes, say you do; it is best to be truthful.
Whatever they may say about a woman's right to conceal where her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love
lies, and pretend it doesn't exist, and things like that, it is not best;
I do know it, Fancy. And an honest woman in that, as well as in all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
daily concerns, shines most brightly, and is thought most of in the long-
run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, perhaps, Dick, I do love you a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) whispered
tenderly; <div class="bookquote">``but I wish you wouldn't say any more now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't say any more now, then, if you don't like it, dear. But you do
love me a little, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you ought not to want me to keep saying things twice; I can't say
any more now, and you must be content with what you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may at any rate call you Fancy? There's no harm in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll not call me Mr. Dewy any more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER II: FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD


<p/>Dick's spirits having risen in the course of these admissions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
sweetheart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) now touched Smart with the whip; and on Smart's neck, not
far behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Smart</b></font>) ears. Smart, who had been lost in thought for some time,
never dreaming that Dick could reach so far with a whip which, on this
particular journey, had never been extended further than his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) flank,
tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) head, and scampered along with exceeding briskness, which was
very pleasant to the young couple behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) till, turning a bend in the
road, they came instantly upon the farmer, farmer's man, and farmer's
wife with the flapping mantle, all jogging on just the same as ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bother those people! Here we are upon them again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of course. They have as much right to the road as we.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but it is provoking to be overlooked so. I like a road all to
myself. Look what a lumbering affair theirs is!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>The wheels of the
farmer's cart, just at that moment, jogged into a depression running
across the road, giving the cart a twist, whereupon all three nodded to
the left, and on coming out of it all three nodded to the right, and went
on jerking their backs in and out as usual. <div class="bookquote">``We'll pass them when the
road gets wider.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>When an opportunity seemed to offer itself for carrying this intention
into effect, they heard light flying wheels behind, and on their
quartering there whizzed along past them a brand-new gig, so brightly
polished that the spokes of the wheels sent forth a continual quivering
light at one point in their circle, and all the panels glared like
mirrors in Dick and Fancy's eyes. The driver, and owner as it appeared,
was really a handsome man; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion was Shiner. Both turned round
as they passed Dick and Fancy, and stared with bold admiration in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
face till they were obliged to attend to the operation of passing the
farmer. Dick glanced for an instant at Fancy while she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was undergoing
their scrutiny; then returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) driving with rather a sad
countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you so silent?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said, after a while, with real concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is, Dick. I couldn't help those people passing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look offended with me. What have I done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell without offending you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, who seemed longing to tell, even at the risk of
offending her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking how different you in love are from me in
love. Whilst those men were staring, you dismissed me from your thoughts
altogether, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't offend me further now; tell all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And showed upon your face a pleased sense of being attractive to 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly, Dick! You know very well I didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) head sceptically, and smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick, I always believe flattery if possible--and it was possible then.
Now there's an open confession of weakness. But I showed no
consciousness of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick, perceiving by her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) look that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) would adhere to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) statement,
charitably forbore saying anything that could make her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) prevaricate. The
sight of Shiner, too, had recalled another branch of the subject to his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)
mind; that which had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) greatest trouble till her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) company and words
had obscured its probability.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way, Fancy, do you know why our quire is to be dismissed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No: except that it is Mr. Maybold's wish for me to play the organ.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know how it came to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) wish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Shiner, being churchwarden, has persuaded the vicar; who, however,
was willing enough before. Shiner, I know, is crazy to see you playing
every Sunday; I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)'ll turn over your music, for the organ will be
close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) pew. But--I know you have never encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never once!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy emphatically, and with eyes full of earnest
truth. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) indeed, and I never heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) doing this
before! I have always felt that I should like to play in a church, but I
never wished to turn you and your choir out; and I never even said that I
could play till I was asked. You don't think for a moment that I did,
surely, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you didn't, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or that I care the least morsel of a bit for him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The distance between Budmouth and Mellstock was ten or eleven miles, and
there being a good inn, <div class="bookquote">``The Ship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>four miles out of Budmouth, with a
mast and cross-trees in front, Dick's custom in driving thither was to
divide the journey into three stages by resting at this inn going and
coming, and not troubling the Budmouth stables at all, whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) visit
to the town was a mere call and deposit, as to-day.

<p/>Fancy was ushered into a little tea-room, and Dick went to the stables to
see to the feeding of Smart. In face of the significant twitches of
feature that were visible in the ostler and labouring men idling around,
Dick endeavoured to look unconscious of the fact that there was any
sentiment between him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) and Fancy beyond a tranter's desire to carry a
passenger home. He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) presently entered the inn and opened the door of
Fancy's room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick, do you know, it has struck me that it is rather awkward, my being
here alone with you like this. I don't think you had better come in with
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's rather unpleasant, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is, and I wanted you to have some tea as well as myself too,
because you must be tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let me have some with you, then. I was denied once before, if you
recollect, Fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, never mind! And it seems unfriendly of me now, but I don't
know what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be as you say, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>Dick began to retreat with a
dissatisfied wrinkling of face, and a farewell glance at the cosy tea-
tray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't see how it is, Dick, when you speak like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said,
with more earnestness than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had ever shown before. <div class="bookquote">``You do know, that
even if I care very much for you, I must remember that I have a difficult
position to maintain. The vicar would not like me, as his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)
schoolmistress, to indulge in a tete-a-tete anywhere with anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not any body!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I mean with a young man;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) added softly, <div class="bookquote">``unless I were
really engaged to be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all? Then, dearest, dearest, why we'll be engaged at once, to
be sure we will, and down I sit! There it is, as easy as a glove!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but suppose I won't! And, goodness me, what have I done!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
faltered, getting very red. <div class="bookquote">``Positively, it seems as if I meant you to
say that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's do it! I mean get engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Fancy, will you be
my wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Dick, it was rather unkind of you to say what you did
coming along the road,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) remarked, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had not heard the latter
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) speech; though an acute observer might have noticed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
breast, as the word `wife' fell from Dick's lips, a soft silent escape of
breaths, with very short rests between each.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About my trying to look attractive to those men in the gig.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't help looking so, whether you tried or no. And, Fancy, you
do care for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll be my own wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) heart quickened, adding to and withdrawing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) cheek varying
tones of red to match each varying thought. Dick looked expectantly at
the ripe tint of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) delicate mouth, waiting for what was coming forth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--if father will let me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick drew himself close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), compressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) lips and pouting them
out, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) were about to whistle the softest melody known.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy solemnly.

<p/>The modest Dick drew back a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick, Dick, kiss me and let me go instantly!--here's somebody coming!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) whisperingly exclaimed.

<p/>* * *

<p/>Half an hour afterwards Dick emerged from the inn, and if Fancy's lips
had been real cherries probably Dick's would have appeared deeply
stained. The landlord was standing in the yard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heu-heu! hay-hay, Master Dewy! Ho-ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) laughed, letting the laugh
slip out gently and by degrees that it might make little noise in its
exit, and smiting Dick under the fifth rib at the same time. <div class="bookquote">``This will
never do, upon my life, Master Dewy! calling for tay for a feymel
passenger, and then going in and sitting down and having some too, and
biding such a fine long time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, with great apparent surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
yes! Ha-ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>smiting the landlord under the ribs in return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what? Yes, yes; ha-ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, of course!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course! But--that is--I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why about--between that young lady and me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>nodding to the window of the
room that Fancy occupied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not I!''  (<font color='red'><b>the innkeeper</b></font>)</div>said the innkeeper, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) eyes into circles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word, I'll take my oath!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you laughed when I laughed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that was me sympathy; so did you when I laughed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, you don't know? Goodness--not knowing that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take my oath I don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, with frigid rhetoric of pitying astonishment, <div class="bookquote">``we're
engaged to be married, you see, and I naturally look after her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>``Of course, of course! I didn't know that, and I hope ye'll excuse any
little freedom of mine, Mr. Dewy. But it is a very odd thing; I was
talking to your father very intimate about family matters only last
Friday in the world, and who should come in but Keeper Day, and we all
then fell a-talking o' family matters; but neither one o' them said a
mortal word about it; knowen me too so many years, and I at your father's
own wedding. <div class="bookquote">``Tisn't what I should have expected from an old neighbour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to say the truth, we hadn't told father of the engagement at that
time; in fact, 'twasn't settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! the business was done Sunday. Yes, yes, Sunday's the courting day.
Heu-heu!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, 'twasn't done Sunday in particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After school-hours this week? Well, a very good time, a very proper
good time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, 'twasn't done then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming along the road to-day then, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all; I wouldn't think of getting engaged in a dog-cart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dammy--might as well have said at once, the when be blowed! Anyhow,
`tis a fine day, and I hope next time you'll come as one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the youth maiden</b></font>)</div><p/>Fancy was duly brought out and assisted into the vehicle, and the newly
affianced youth and maiden passed up the steep hill to the Ridgeway, and
vanished in the direction of Mellstock.



<p/>CHAPTER III: A CONFESSION


<p/>It was a morning of the latter summer-time; a morning of lingering dews,
when the grass is never dry in the shade. Fuchsias and dahlias were
laden till eleven o'clock with small drops and dashes of water, changing
the colour of their sparkle at every movement of the air; and elsewhere
hanging on twigs like small silver fruit. The threads of garden spiders
appeared thick and polished. In the dry and sunny places, dozens of long-
legged crane-flies whizzed off the grass at every step the passer took.

<p/>Fancy Day and her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) friend Susan Dewy the tranter's daughter, were in such
a spot as this, pulling down a bough laden with early apples. Three
months had elapsed since Dick and Fancy had journeyed together from
Budmouth, and the course of their love had run on vigorously during the
whole time. There had been just enough difficulty attending its
development, and just enough finesse required in keeping it private, to
lend the passion an ever-increasing freshness on Fancy's part, whilst,
whether from these accessories or not, Dick's heart had been at all times
as fond as could be desired. But there was a cloud on Fancy's horizon
now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is so well off--better than any of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Dewy</b></font>)</div>Susan Dewy was saying. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
father farms five hundred acres, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might marry a doctor or curate
or anything of that kind if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) contrived a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think Dick ought to have gone to that gipsy-party at all when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
knew I couldn't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Fancy uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) didn't know that you would not be there till it was too late to
refuse the invitation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what was she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) like? Tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was rather pretty, I must own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell straight on about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), can't you! Come, do, Susan. How many times
did you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twice, I think you said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I'm sure I didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) wanted to again, I expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) wanted to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) again bad
enough, I know. Everybody does with Dick, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'s so handsome and
such a clever courter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I wish!--How did you say she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) hair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In long curls,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) hair is light, and it curls without being put in
paper: that's how it is she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)'s so attractive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)'s trying to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) away! yes, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) is! And through keeping
this miserable school I mustn't wear my hair in curls! But I will; I
don't care if I leave the school and go home, I will wear my curls! Look,
Susan, do! is her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) hair as soft and long as this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Dewy</b></font>)</div>Fancy pulled from its
coil under her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) hat a twine of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own hair, and stretched it down her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
shoulder to show its length, looking at Susan to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) opinion from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is about the same length as that, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Dewy.

<p/>Fancy paused hopelessly. <div class="bookquote">``I wish mine was lighter, like hers!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
continued mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``But hers isn't so soft, is it? Tell me, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Fancy abstractedly extended her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) vision to survey a yellow butterfly and a
red-and-black butterfly that were flitting along in company, and then
became aware that Dick was advancing up the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Susan, here's Dick coming; I suppose that's because we've been talking
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I shall go indoors now--you won't want me;''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Dewy</b></font>)</div>and Susan turned
practically and walked off.

<p/>Enter the single-minded Dick, whose only fault at the gipsying, or
picnic, had been that of loving Fancy too exclusively, and depriving
himself of the innocent pleasure the gathering might have afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>),
by sighing regretfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) absence,--who had danced with the rival in
sheer despair of ever being able to get through that stale, flat, and
unprofitable afternoon in any other way; but this she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) would not believe.

<p/>Fancy had settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) plan of emotion. To reproach Dick? O no, no. <div class="bookquote">``I
am in great trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), taking what was intended to be a
hopelessly melancholy survey of a few small apples lying under the tree;
yet a critical ear might have noticed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) voice a tentative tone as to
the effect of the words upon Dick when she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) uttered them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you in trouble about? Tell me of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick earnestly.
<div class="bookquote">``Darling, I will share it with `ee and help `ee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no: you can't! Nobody can!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? You don't deserve it, whatever it is. Tell me, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, it isn't what you think! It is dreadful: my own sin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sin, Fancy! as if you could sin! I know it can't be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis, `tis!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady, in a pretty little frenzy of sorrow.
<div class="bookquote">``I have done wrong, and I don't like to tell it! Nobody will forgive me,
nobody! and you above all will not! ... I have allowed myself
to--to--fl--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What,--not flirt!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, controlling his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) emotion as it were by a
sudden pressure inward from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) surface. <div class="bookquote">``And you said only the day
before yesterday that you hadn't flirted in your life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did; and that was a wicked story! I have let another love me,
and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good G--! Well, I'll forgive you,--yes, if you couldn't help it,--yes,
I will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said the now dismal Dick. <div class="bookquote">``Did you encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O,--I don't know,--yes--no. O, I think so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A pause. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Shiner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>After a silence that was only disturbed by the fall of an apple, a long-
checked sigh from Dick, and a sob from Fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said with real
austerity--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell it all;--every word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) looked at me, and I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) said, ``Will you let me show
you how to catch bullfinches down here by the stream?'' And I--wanted to
know very much--I did so long to have a bullfinch! I couldn't help that
and I said, ``Yes!'' and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, ``Come here.'' And I went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
down to the lovely river, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said to me, ``Look and see how I do
it, and then you'll know: I put this birdlime round this twig, and then I
go here,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, `and hide away under a bush; and presently clever
Mister Bird comes and perches upon the twig, and flaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) wings, and
you've got him (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) before you can say Jack'--something; O, O, O, I forget
what!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack Sprat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>mournfully suggested Dick through the cloud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) misery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not Jack Sprat,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) sobbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then 'twas Jack Robinson!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, with the emphasis of a man who had
resolved to discover every iota of the truth, or die.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that was it! And then I put my hand upon the rail of the bridge to
get across, and--That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that isn't much, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick critically, and more
cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``Not that I see what business Shiner has to take upon
himself to teach you anything. But it seems--it do seem there must have
been more than that to set you up in such a dreadful taking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) looked into Fancy's eyes. Misery of miseries!--guilt was written
there still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Fancy, you've not told me all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, rather sternly for a
quiet young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, don't speak so cruelly! I am afraid to tell now! If you hadn't been
harsh, I was going on to tell all; now I can't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, dear Fancy, tell: come. I'll forgive; I must,--by heaven and
earth, I must, whether I will or no; I love you so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, when I put my hand on the bridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) touched it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A scamp!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, grinding an imaginary human frame to powder.

<p/>``And then he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) looked at me, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) said, ``Are you in love with
Dick Dewy?'' And I said, ``Perhaps I am!'' and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you
weren't then, for I want to marry you, with all my soul.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a villain now! Want to marry you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>And Dick quivered with the
bitterness of satirical laughter. Then suddenly remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
might be reckoning without his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) host: <div class="bookquote">``Unless, to be sure, you are willing
to have him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>),--perhaps you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, with the wretched indifference
of a castaway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed I am not!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) sobs just beginning to take a
favourable turn towards cure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, coming a little to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) senses, <div class="bookquote">``you've been
stretching it very much in giving such a dreadful beginning to such a
mere nothing. And I know what you've done it for,--just because of that
gipsy-party!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) and took five paces decisively, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) were tired of an ungrateful country, including herself. <div class="bookquote">``You did
it to make me jealous, and I won't stand it!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) flung the words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) shoulder and then stalked on, apparently very anxious to walk to
the remotest of the Colonies that very minute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, O, O, Dick--Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) cried, trotting after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) like a pet lamb, and
really seriously alarmed at last, <div class="bookquote">``you'll kill me! My impulses are
bad--miserably wicked,--and I can't help it; forgive me, Dick! And I
love you always; and those times when you look silly and don't seem quite
good enough for me,--just the same, I do, Dick! And there is something
more serious, though not concerning that walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, altering his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mind about walking to the
Colonies; in fact, passing to the other extreme, and standing so rooted
to the road that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was apparently not even going home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, drying the beginning of a new flood of tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
had been going to shed, <div class="bookquote">``this is the serious part. Father has told Mr.
Shiner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) for a son-in-law, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could get me;--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) right hearty consent to come courting me!''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IV: AN ARRANGEMENT


<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, more intellectually than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had spoken for
a long time.

<p/>The truth was that Geoffrey knew nothing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) daughter's continued
walks and meetings with Dick. When a hint that there were symptoms of an
attachment between them had first reached Geoffrey's ears, he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) stated so
emphatically that he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) must think the matter over before any such thing
could be allowed that, rather unwisely on Dick's part, whatever it might
have been on the lady's, the lovers were careful to be seen together no
more in public; and Geoffrey, forgetting the report, did not think over
the matter at all. So Mr. Shiner resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) old position in Geoffrey's
brain by mere flux of time. Even Shiner began to believe that Dick
existed for Fancy no more,--though that remarkably easy-going man had
taken no active steps on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) own account as yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And father has not only told Mr. Shiner that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Fancy, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)
has written me a letter, to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) should wish me to encourage Mr.
Shiner, if 'twas convenient!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must start off and see your father at once!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, taking two or
three vehement steps to the south, recollecting that Mr. Day lived to the
north, and coming back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we had better see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) together. Not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) what you come for,
or anything of the kind, until he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) likes you, and so win his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brain through
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart, which is always the way to manage people. I mean in this way:
I am going home on Saturday week to help them in the honey-taking. You
might come there to me, have something to eat and drink, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
guess what your coming signifies, without saying it in so many words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll do it, dearest. But I shall ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for you, flat and plain; not
wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) guessing.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>And the lover then stepped close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), and
attempted to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) one little kiss on the cheek, his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lips alighting,
however, on an outlying tract of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) back hair by reason of an impulse
that had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head with a jerk. ``Yes, and I'll put on
my second-best suit and a clean shirt and collar, and black my boots as
if 'twas a Sunday. <div class="bookquote">``Twill have a good appearance, you see, and that's a
great deal to start with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't wear that old waistcoat, will you, Dick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, no! Why I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to be personal, dear Dick,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said, fearing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had hurt
his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) feelings. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis a very nice waistcoat, but what I meant was, that
though it is an excellent waistcoat for a settled-down man, it is not
quite one for''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) waited, and a blush expanded over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face, and then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) went on again-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``for going courting in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll wear my best winter one, with the leather lining, that mother
made. It is a beautiful, handsome waistcoat inside, yes, as ever anybody
saw. In fact, only the other day, I unbuttoned it to show a chap that
very lining, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said it was the strongest, handsomest lining you
could wish to see on the king's waistcoat himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite know what to wear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) habitual
indifference alone to dress had kept back so important a subject till
now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that blue frock you wore last week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't set well round the neck. I couldn't wear that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shan't care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you won't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then it's all right. Because you only care how you look to me, do
you, dear? I only dress for you, that's certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you see I couldn't appear in it again very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any strange gentleman you mid meet in your journey might notice the set
of it, I suppose. Fancy, men in love don't think so much about how they
look to other women.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It is difficult to say whether a tone of playful
banter or of gentle reproach prevailed in the speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, Dick,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said, with good-humoured frankness, ``I'll own it.
I shouldn't like a stranger to see me dressed badly, even though I am in
love. <div class="bookquote">``Tis our nature, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You perfect woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; if you lay the stress on `woman,'''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) murmured, looking at a group
of hollyhocks in flower, round which a crowd of butterflies had gathered
like female idlers round a bonnet-shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But about the dress. Why not wear the one you wore at our party?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That sets well, but a girl of the name of Bet Tallor, who lives near our
house, has had one made almost like it -LRB-only in pattern, though of
miserably cheap stuff-RRB-, and I couldn't wear it on that account. Dear me,
I am afraid I can't go now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, you must; I know you will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, with dismay. <div class="bookquote">``Why not
wear what you've got on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! this old one! After all, I think that by wearing my gray one
Saturday, I can make the blue one do for Sunday. Yes, I will. A hat or
a bonnet, which shall it be? Which do I look best in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think the bonnet is nicest, more quiet and matronly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the objection to the hat? Does it make me look old?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no; the hat is well enough; but it makes you look rather too--you
won't mind me saying it, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, for I shall wear the bonnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--Rather too coquettish and flirty for an engaged young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reflected a minute. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; yes. Still, after all, the hat would do
best; hats are best, you see. Yes, I must wear the hat, dear Dicky,
because I ought to wear a hat, you know.''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>PART THE FOURTH--AUTUMN


<p/>CHAPTER I: GOING NUTTING


<p/>Dick, dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) `second-best' suit, burst into Fancy's sitting-room
with a glow of pleasure on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) face.

<p/>It was two o'clock on Friday, the day before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) contemplated visit to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father, and for some reason connected with cleaning the school the
children had been given this Friday afternoon for pastime, in addition to
the usual Saturday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy! it happens just right that it is a leisure half day with you.
Smart is lame in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smart</b></font>) near-foot-afore, and so, as I can't do anything,
I've made a holiday afternoon of it, and am come for you to go nutting
with me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sitting by the parlour window, with a blue frock lying across her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
lap and scissors in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go nutting! Yes. But I'm afraid I can't go for an hour or so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Why not? <div class="bookquote">``Tis the only spare afternoon we may both have together for
weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This dress of mine, that I am going to wear on Sunday at Yalbury;--I
find it fits so badly that I must alter it a little, after all. I told
the dressmaker to make it by a pattern I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) at the time; instead of
that, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did it her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own way, and made me look a perfect fright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long will you be?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) inquired, looking rather disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not long. Do wait and talk to me; come, do, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick sat down. The talking progressed very favourably, amid the snipping
and sewing, till about half-past two, at which time his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) conversation
began to be varied by a slight tapping upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) toe with a walking-stick
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had cut from the hedge as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) came along. Fancy talked and answered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), but sometimes the answers were so negligently given, that it was
evident her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts lay for the greater part in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap with the blue
dress.

<p/>The clock struck three. Dick arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) seat, walked round the room
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), examined all the furniture, then sounded a few
notes on the harmonium, then looked inside all the books he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could find,
then smoothed Fancy's head with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hand. Still the snipping and sewing
went on.

<p/>The clock struck four. Dick fidgeted about, yawned privately; counted
the knots in the table, yawned publicly; counted the flies on the
ceiling, yawned horribly; went into the kitchen and scullery, and so
thoroughly studied the principle upon which the pump was constructed that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could have delivered a lecture on the subject. Stepping back to
Fancy, and finding still that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had not done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) garden
and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) cabbages and potatoes, and reminded himself that they
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) to wear a decidedly feminine aspect; then pulled up several
weeds, and came in again. The clock struck five, and still the snipping
and sewing went on.

<p/>Dick attempted to kill a fly, peeled all the rind off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) walking-stick,
then threw the stick into the scullery because it was spoilt, produced
hideous discords from the harmonium, and accidentally overturned a vase
of flowers, the water from which ran in a rill across the table and
dribbled to the floor, where it formed a lake, the shape of which, after
the lapse of a few minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) began to modify considerably with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
foot, till it was like a map of England and Wales.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Dick, you needn't have made quite such a mess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I needn't, I suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) walked up to the blue dress, and looked
at it with a rigid gaze. Then an idea seemed to cross his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) brain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you said you were going to wear your gray gown all day
to-morrow on your trip to Yalbury, and in the evening too, when I shall
be with you, and ask your father for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the blue one only on Sunday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the blue one Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear, I sha'n't be at Yalbury Sunday to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I shall walk to Longpuddle church in the afternoon with father,
and such lots of people will be looking at me there, you know; and it did
set so badly round the neck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never noticed it, and `tis like nobody else would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then why not wear the gray one on Sunday as well? <div class="bookquote">``Tis as pretty as the
blue one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might make the gray one do, certainly. But it isn't so good; it
didn't cost half so much as this one, and besides, it would be the same I
wore Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then wear the striped one, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or the dark one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I might; but I want to wear a fresh one they haven't seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, in a voice in which the tones of love were
decidedly inconvenienced by a considerable emphasis, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) thoughts
meanwhile running as follows: <div class="bookquote">``I, the man she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loves best in the world, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says, am to understand that my poor half-holiday is to be lost,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wants to wear on Sunday a gown there is not the slightest
necessity for wearing, simply, in fact, to appear more striking than
usual in the eyes of Longpuddle young men; and I not there, either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there are three dresses good enough for my eyes, but neither is
good enough for the youths of Longpuddle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not that exactly, Dick. Still, you see, I do want--to look pretty
to them--there, that's honest! But I sha'n't be much longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A quarter of an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; I'll come in in a quarter of an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mid as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) went out, walked down the road, and sat upon a gate. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
meditated and meditated, and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) meditated the more decidedly did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) begin to fume, and the more positive was he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) time had been
scandalously trifled with by Miss Fancy Day--that, so far from being the
simple girl who had never had a sweetheart before, as she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) had solemnly
assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) time after time, she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) was, if not a flirt, a woman who had had
no end of admirers; a girl most certainly too anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) frocks; a
girl, whose feelings, though warm, were not deep; a girl who cared a
great deal too much how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appeared in the eyes of other men. <div class="bookquote">``What she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
loves best in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) thought, with an incipient spice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
father's grimness, <div class="bookquote">``is her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hair and complexion. What she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loves next
best, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gowns and hats; what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loves next best, myself, perhaps!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Suffering great anguish at this disloyalty in himself and harshness to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) darling, yet disposed to persevere in it, a horribly cruel thought
crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) would not call for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had promised, at the
end of a quarter of an hour! Yes, it would be a punishment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) well
deserved. Although the best part of the afternoon had been wasted he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
would go nutting as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had intended, and go by himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) leaped over the gate, and pushed up the lane for nearly two miles,
till a winding path called Snail-Creep sloped up a hill and entered a
hazel copse by a hole like a rabbit's burrow. In he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) plunged, vanished
among the bushes, and in a short time there was no sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) existence
upon earth, save an occasional rustling of boughs and snapping of twigs
in divers points of Grey's Wood.

<p/>Never man nutted as Dick nutted that afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) worked like a galley
slave. Half-hour after half-hour passed away, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) gathered
without ceasing. At last, when the sun had set, and bunches of nuts
could not be distinguished from the leaves which nourished them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) bag, containing quite two pecks of the finest produce of
the wood, about as much use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) as two pecks of stones from the road,
strolled down the woodland track, crossed the highway and entered the
homeward lane, whistling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) went.

<p/>Probably, Miss Fancy Day never before or after stood so low in Mr. Dewy's
opinion as on that afternoon. In fact, it is just possible that a few
more blue dresses on the Longpuddle young men's account would have
clarified Dick's brain entirely, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) once more a free man.

<p/>But Venus had planned other developments, at any rate for the present.
Cuckoo-Lane, the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursued, passed over a ridge which rose keenly
against the sky about fifty yards in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) van. Here, upon the bright
after-glow about the horizon, was now visible an irregular shape, which
at first he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conceived to be a bough standing a little beyond the line of
its neighbours. Then it seemed to move, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advanced still
further, there was no doubt that it was a living being sitting in the
bank, head bowed on hand. The grassy margin entirely prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
footsteps from being heard, and it was not till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was close that the
figure recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Up it sprang, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was face to face with Fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick, Dick! O, is it you, Dick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, in a rather repentant tone, and lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
nuts.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), flung her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parasol on the grass, put her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little head
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) breast, and then there began a narrative, disjointed by such
a hysterical weeping as was never surpassed for intensity in the whole
history of love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Dick,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sobbed out, ``where have you been away from me? O, I have
suffered agony, and thought you would never come any more! ``Tis cruel,
Dick; no `tisn't, it is justice! I've been walking miles and miles up
and down Grey's Wood, trying to find you, till I was wearied and worn
out, and I could walk no further, and had come back this far! O Dick,
directly you were gone, I thought I had offended you and I put down the
dress; `tisn't finished now, and I never will finish, it, and I'll wear
an old one Sunday! Yes, Dick, I will, because I don't care what I wear
when you are not by my side--ha, you think I do, but I don't!--and I ran
after you, and I saw you go up Snail-Creep and not look back once, and
then you plunged in, and I after you; but I was too far behind. O, I did
wish the horrid bushes had been cut down, so that I could see your dear
shape again! And then I called out to you, and nobody answered, and I
was afraid to call very loud, lest anybody else should hear me. Then I
kept wandering and wandering about, and it was dreadful misery, Dick. And
then I shut my eyes and fell to picturing you looking at some other
woman, very pretty and nice, but with no affection or truth in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at
all, and then imagined you saying to yourself, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s as good as
Fancy, for Fancy told me a story, and was a flirt, and cared for herself
more than me, so now I'll have this one for my sweetheart.''  (<font color='red'><b>some woman</b></font>)</div>O, you
won't, will you, Dick, for I do love you so!''

<p/>It is scarcely necessary to add that Dick renounced his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) freedom there and
then, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ten times over, and promised that no pretty woman of
the kind alluded to should ever engross his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) thoughts; in short, that
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had been vexed with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), all such vexation was past, and that
henceforth and for ever it was simply Fancy or death for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>). And then
they set about proceeding homewards, very slowly on account of Fancy's
weariness, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leaning upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) shoulder, and in addition receiving
support from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waist; though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had sufficiently
recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desperate condition to sing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Why are you
wandering here, I pray?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>during the latter part of their walk. Nor is it
necessary to describe in detail how the bag of nuts was quite forgotten
until three days later, when it was found among the brambles and restored
empty to Mrs. Dewy, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) initials being marked thereon in red cotton; and
how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) puzzled herself till her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head ached upon the question of how on
earth her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meal-bag could have got into Cuckoo-Lane.



<p/>CHAPTER II: HONEY-TAKING, AND AFTERWARDS


<p/>Saturday evening saw Dick Dewy journeying on foot to Yalbury Wood,
according to the arrangement with Fancy.

<p/>The landscape being concave, at the going down of the sun everything
suddenly assumed a uniform robe of shade. The evening advanced from
sunset to dusk long before Dick's arrival, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) progress during the
latter portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) walk through the trees was indicated by the flutter
of terrified birds that had been roosting over the path. And in crossing
the glades, masses of hot dry air, that had been formed on the hills
during the day, greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) cheeks alternately with clouds of damp night
air from the valleys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) reached the keeper-steward's house, where the
grass-plot and the garden in front appeared light and pale against the
unbroken darkness of the grove from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had emerged, and paused at
the garden gate.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had scarcely been there a minute when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) beheld a sort of procession
advancing from the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) front. It consisted first of Enoch the
trapper, carrying a spade on his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) shoulder and a lantern dangling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>)
hand; then came Mrs. Day, the light of the lantern revealing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
bore in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) arms curious objects about a foot long, in the form of Latin
crosses -LRB-made of lath and brown paper dipped in brimstone--called matches
by bee-masters-RRB-; next came Miss Day, with a shawl thrown over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) head;
and behind all, in the gloom, Mr. Frederic Shiner.

<p/>Dick, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) consternation at finding Shiner present, was at a loss how
to proceed, and retired under a tree to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I be, Enoch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said a voice; and the procession advancing farther,
the lantern's rays illuminated the figure of Geoffrey, awaiting their
arrival beside a row of bee-hives, in front of the path. Taking the
spade from Enoch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) proceeded to dig two holes in the earth beside the
hives, the others standing round in a circle, except Mrs. Day, who
deposited her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) matches in the fork of an apple-tree and returned to the
house. The party remaining were now lit up in front by the lantern in
their midst, their shadows radiating each way upon the garden-plot like
the spokes of a wheel. An apparent embarrassment of Fancy at the
presence of Shiner caused a silence in the assembly, during which the
preliminaries of execution were arranged, the matches fixed, the stake
kindled, the two hives placed over the two holes, and the earth stopped
round the edges. Geoffrey then stood erect, and rather more, to
straighten his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) backbone after the digging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They were a peculiar family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shiner, regarding the hives
reflectively.

<p/>Geoffrey nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those holes will be the grave of thousands!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy. <div class="bookquote">``I think `tis
rather a cruel thing to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) father shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) said, tapping the hives to shake the
dead bees from their cells, <div class="bookquote">``if you suffocate 'em this way, they only die
once: if you fumigate 'em in the new way, they come to life again, and
die o' starvation; so the pangs o' death be twice upon 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I incline to Fancy's notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shiner, laughing lightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The proper way to take honey, so that the bees be neither starved nor
murdered, is a puzzling matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>said the keeper steadily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like never to take it from them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But `tis the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Enoch</b></font>)</div>said Enoch musingly. <div class="bookquote">``For without money man is a
shadder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>marauders</b></font>)</div><p/>The lantern-light had disturbed many bees that had escaped from hives
destroyed some days earlier, and, demoralized by affliction, were now
getting a living as marauders about the doors of other hives. Several
flew round the head and neck of Geoffrey; then darted upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) with an
irritated bizz.

<p/>Enoch threw down the lantern, and ran off and pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) head into a
currant bush; Fancy scudded up the path; and Mr. Shiner floundered away
helter-skelter among the cabbages. Geoffrey stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) ground, unmoved
and firm as a rock. Fancy was the first to return, followed by Enoch
picking up the lantern. Mr. Shiner still remained invisible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have the craters stung ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Enoch</b></font>)</div>said Enoch to Geoffrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not much--on'y a little here and there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) said with leisurely
solemnity, shaking one bee out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) shirt sleeve, pulling another from
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) hair, and two or three more from his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) neck. The rest looked on
during this proceeding with a complacent sense of being out of it,--much
as a European nation in a state of internal commotion is watched by its
neighbours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are those all of them, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, when Geoffrey had pulled
away five.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost all,--though I feel one or two more sticking into my shoulder and
side. Ah! there's another just begun again upon my backbone. You lively
young mortals, how did you get inside there? However, they can't sting
me many times more, poor things, for they must be getting weak. They mid
as well stay in me till bedtime now, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) himself was the only person affected by this arrangement, it seemed
satisfactory enough; and after a noise of feet kicking against cabbages
in a blundering progress among them, the voice of Mr. Shiner was heard
from the darkness in that direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is all quite safe again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No answer being returned to this query, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) apparently assumed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)
might venture forth, and gradually drew near the lantern again. The
hives were now removed from their position over the holes, one being
handed to Enoch to carry indoors, and one being taken by Geoffrey
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring hither the lantern, Fancy: the spade can bide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div><p/>Geoffrey and Enoch then went towards the house, leaving Shiner and Fancy
standing side by side on the garden-plot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Shiner, stooping for the lantern and seizing it at the
same time with Fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can carry it,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, religiously repressing all inclination to
trifle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) had thoroughly considered that subject after the tearful
explanation of the bird-catching adventure to Dick, and had decided that
it would be dishonest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>), as an engaged young woman, to trifle with
men's eyes and hands any more. Finding that Shiner still retained his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)
hold of the lantern, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) relinquished it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>), having found her (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)
retaining it, also let go. The lantern fell, and was extinguished. Fancy
moved on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the path?''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shiner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy. <div class="bookquote">``Your eyes will get used to the dark in a minute or
two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till that time will ye lend me your hand?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Fancy gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) the extreme
tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) fingers, and they stepped from the plot into the path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't accept attentions very freely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It depends upon who offers them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fellow like me, for instance.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A dead silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you say, Missie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It then depends upon how they are offered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not wildly, and yet not careless-like; not purposely, and yet not by
chance; not too quick nor yet too slow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coolly and practically,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``How would that kind of love be
taken?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not anxiously, and yet not indifferently; neither blushing nor pale; nor
religiously nor yet quite wickedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>Geoffrey Day's storehouse at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Day</b></font>) dwelling was hung with
bunches of dried horehound, mint, and sage; brown-paper bags of thyme and
lavender; and long ropes of clean onions. On shelves were spread large
red and yellow apples, and choice selections of early potatoes for seed
next year;--vulgar crowds of commoner kind lying beneath in heaps. A few
empty beehives were clustered around a nail in one corner, under which
stood two or three barrels of new cider of the first crop, each bubbling
and squirting forth from the yet open bunghole.

<p/>Fancy was now kneeling beside the two inverted hives, one of which rested
against her (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) lap, for convenience in operating upon the contents. She (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>)
thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) sleeves above her (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) elbows, and inserted her (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) small pink hand
edgewise between each white lobe of honeycomb, performing the act so
adroitly and gently as not to unseal a single cell. Then cracking the
piece off at the crown of the hive by a slight backward and forward
movement, she (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) lifted each portion as it was loosened into a large blue
platter, placed on a bench at her (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bother these little mortals!''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey, who was holding the light
to her (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>), and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) back an uneasy twist. <div class="bookquote">``I really think I may as
well go indoors and take 'em out, poor things! for they won't let me
alone. There's two a stinging wi' all their might now. I'm sure I
wonder their strength can last so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, friend; I'll hold the candle whilst you are gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Shiner, leisurely taking the light, and allowing Geoffrey to depart,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) did with his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) usual long paces.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) could hardly have gone round to the house-door when other footsteps
were heard approaching the outbuilding; the tip of a finger appeared in
the hole through which the wood latch was lifted, and Dick Dewy came in,
having been all this time walking up and down the wood, vainly waiting
for Shiner's departure.

<p/>Fancy looked up and welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) rather confusedly. Shiner grasped the
candlestick more firmly, and, lest doing this in silence should not imply
to Dick with sufficient force that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was quite at home and cool, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) sang
invincibly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`King Arthur he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had three sons.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indoors, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, looking pleasantly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).

<p/>Dick surveyed the scene, and did not seem inclined to hurry off just at
that moment. Shiner went on singing--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`The miller was drown'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) pond,
The weaver was hung in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) yarn,
And the d-- ran away with the little tail-or,
With the broadcloth under his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) arm.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a terrible crippled rhyme, if that's your rhyme!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, with
a grain of superciliousness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use your complaining to me about the rhyme!''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shiner.
<div class="bookquote">``You must go to the man that made it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Fancy by this time had acquired confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Taste a bit, Mr. Dewy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, holding up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) a small circular
piece of honeycomb that had been the last in the row of layers, remaining
still on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) knees and flinging back her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) head to look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) face; <div class="bookquote">``and
then I'll taste a bit too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shiner. Nevertheless the farmer looked
superior, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) could even now hardly join the trifling from very
importance of station; and after receiving the honeycomb from Fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>)
turned it over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) hand till the cells began to be crushed, and the
liquid honey ran down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) fingers in a thin string.

<p/>Suddenly a faint cry from Fancy caused them to gaze at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing, but O-o! a bee has stung the inside of my lip! He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was in
one of the cells I was eating!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must keep down the swelling, or it may be serious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Shiner,
stepping up and kneeling beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Let me see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just let me see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, kneeling on the other side: and after
some hesitation she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) pressed down her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) lip with one finger to show the
place. <div class="bookquote">``O, I hope `twill soon be better! I don't mind a sting in
ordinary places, but it is so bad upon your lip,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) added with tears in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) eyes, and writhing a little from the pain.

<p/>Shiner held the light above his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) head and pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) face close to
Fancy's, as if the lip had been shown exclusively to himself, upon which
Dick pushed closer, as if Shiner were not there at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is swelling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) right aspect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't swelling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Shiner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) left aspect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it dangerous on the lip?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Fancy. <div class="bookquote">``I know it is dangerous on
the tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, not dangerous!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>answered Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather dangerous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>had answered Shiner simultaneously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must try to bear it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, turning again to the hives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hartshorn-and-oil is a good thing to put to it, Miss Day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Shiner
with great concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweet-oil-and-hartshorn I've found to be a good thing to cure stings,
Miss Day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick with greater concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have some mixed indoors; would you kindly run and get it for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
said.

<p/>Now, whether by inadvertence, or whether by mischievous intention, the
individuality of the you was so carelessly denoted that both Dick and
Shiner sprang to their feet like twin acrobats, and marched abreast to
the door; both seized the latch and lifted it, and continued marching on,
shoulder to shoulder, in the same manner to the dwelling-house. Not only
so, but entering the room, they marched as before straight up to Mrs.
Day's chair, letting the door in the oak partition slam so forcibly, that
the rows of pewter on the dresser rang like a bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Day, Fancy has stung her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) lip, and wants you to give me the
hartshorn, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shiner/Mr. Shiner</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shiner, very close to Mrs. Day's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Mrs. Day, Fancy has asked me to bring out the hartshorn, please,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) has stung her (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) lip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, a little closer to Mrs. Day's
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, men alive! that's no reason why you should eat me, I suppose!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Day, drawing back.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Shiner</b></font>) searched in the corner-cupboard, produced the bottle, and began to
dust the cork, the rim, and every other part very carefully, Dick's hand
and Shiner's hand waiting side by side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is head man?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Day. <div class="bookquote">``Now, don't come mumbudgeting so
close again. Which is head man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither spoke; and the bottle was inclined towards Shiner. Shiner, as a
high-class man, would not look in the least triumphant, and turned to go
off with it as Geoffrey came downstairs after the search in his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) linen for
concealed bees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O--that you, Master Dewy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick assured the keeper that it was; and the young man then determined
upon a bold stroke for the attainment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) end, forgetting that the
worst of bold strokes is the disastrous consequences they involve if they
fail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come on purpose to speak to you very particular, Mr. Day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said,
with a crushing emphasis intended for the ears of Mr. Shiner, who was
vanishing round the door-post at that moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've been forced to go upstairs and unrind myself, and shake some
bees out o' me''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey, walking slowly towards the open door, and
standing on the threshold. <div class="bookquote">``The young rascals got into my shirt and
wouldn't be quiet nohow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to speak a word to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) repeated, looking out at the pale
mist creeping up from the gloom of the valley. <div class="bookquote">``You may perhaps guess
what it is about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The keeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The keeper lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) hands into the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) pockets, twirled his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>)
eyes, balanced himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) toes, looked as perpendicularly downward as
if his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) glance were a plumb-line, then horizontally, collecting together
the cracks that lay about his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) face till they were all in the
neighbourhood of his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) replied.

<p/>Dick said nothing; and the stillness was disturbed only by some small
bird that was being killed by an owl in the adjoining wood, whose cry
passed into the silence without mingling with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've left my hat up in chammer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey; <div class="bookquote">``wait while I step up
and get en.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be in the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) went round by a side wicket into the garden, and Geoffrey went
upstairs. It was the custom in Mellstock and its vicinity to discuss
matters of pleasure and ordinary business inside the house, and to
reserve the garden for very important affairs: a custom which, as is
supposed, originated in the desirability of getting away at such times
from the other members of the family when there was only one room for
living in, though it was now quite as frequently practised by those who
suffered from no such limitation to the size of their domiciles.

<p/>The head-keeper's form appeared in the dusky garden, and Dick walked
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>). The elder paused and leant over the rail of a piggery that
stood on the left of the path, upon which Dick did the same; and they
both contemplated a whitish shadowy shape that was moving about and
grunting among the straw of the interior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to ask for Fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd as lief you hadn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should that be, Mr. Day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it makes me say that you've come to ask what ye be'n't likely to
have. Have ye come for anything else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll just tell `ee you've come on a very foolish errand. D'ye know

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A teacher in a landed family's nursery, who was foolish enough to marry

and sand sales and one thing and `tother. However, d'ye think Fancy
picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) good manners, the smooth turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tongue, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) musical

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and do ye know what I live in such a miserly way for when I've got

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Mr. Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Modest Dick's reply had faltered upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) tongue, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) turned away
wondering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) presumption in asking for a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had seen from
the beginning to be so superior to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER III: FANCY IN THE RAIN


<p/>The next scene is a tempestuous afternoon in the following month, and
Fancy Day is discovered walking from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father's home towards Mellstock.

<p/>A single vast gray cloud covered the country, from which the small rain
and mist had just begun to blow down in wavy sheets, alternately thick
and thin. The trees of the fields and plantations writhed like miserable
men as the air wound its way swiftly among them: the lowest portions of
their trunks, that had hardly ever been known to move, were visibly
rocked by the fiercer gusts, distressing the mind by its painful
unwontedness, as when a strong man is seen to shed tears. Low-hanging
boughs went up and down; high and erect boughs went to and fro; the
blasts being so irregular, and divided into so many cross-currents, that
neighbouring branches of the same tree swept the skies in independent
motions, crossed each other, or became entangled. Across the open spaces
flew flocks of green and yellowish leaves, which, after travelling a long
distance from their parent trees, reached the ground, and lay there with
their under-sides upward.

<p/>As the rain and wind increased, and Fancy's bonnet-ribbons leapt more and
more snappishly against her (<font color='blue'><b>parent</b></font>) chin, she (<font color='blue'><b>parent</b></font>) paused on entering Mellstock Lane
to consider her (<font color='blue'><b>parent</b></font>) latitude, and the distance to a place of shelter. The
nearest house was Elizabeth Endorfield's, in Higher Mellstock, whose
cottage and garden stood not far from the junction of that hamlet with
the road she (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) followed. Fancy hastened onward, and in five minutes
entered a gate, which shed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) toes a flood of water-drops as she (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>)
opened it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, chiel!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a voice exclaimed, before Fancy had knocked: a
promptness that would have surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) had she (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) not known that Mrs.
Endorfield was an exceedingly and exceptionally sharp woman in the use of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) eyes and ears.

<p/>Fancy went in and sat down. Elizabeth was paring potatoes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
husband's supper.

<p/>Scrape, scrape, scrape; then a toss, and splash went a potato into a
bucket of water.

<p/>Now, as Fancy listlessly noted these proceedings of the dame, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began
to reconsider an old subject that lay uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart. Since the
interview between her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father and Dick, the days had been melancholy days
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Geoffrey's firm opposition to the notion of Dick as a son-in-
law was more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had frequently seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lover
since that time, it is true, and had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) more for the opposition
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would have otherwise dreamt of doing--which was a happiness of a
certain kind. Yet, though love is thus an end in itself, it must be
believed to be the means to another end if it is to assume the rosy hues
of an unalloyed pleasure. And such a belief Fancy and Dick were
emphatically denied just now.

<p/>Elizabeth Endorfield had a repute among women which was in its nature
something between distinction and notoriety. It was founded on the
following items of character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) was shrewd and penetrating; her (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) house
stood in a lonely place; she (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) never went to church; she (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) wore a red cloak;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) always retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) bonnet indoors and she (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) had a pointed chin. Thus
far her (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) attributes were distinctly Satanic; and those who looked no
further called her (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>), in plain terms, a witch. But she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) was not gaunt, nor
ugly in the upper part of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) face, nor particularly strange in manner;
so that, when her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) more intimate acquaintances spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) the term was
softened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) became simply a Deep Body, who was as long-headed as
she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) was high. It may be stated that Elizabeth belonged to a class of
suspects who were gradually losing their mysterious characteristics under
the administration of the young vicar; though, during the long reign of
Mr. Grinham, the parish of Mellstock had proved extremely favourable to
the growth of witches.

<p/>While Fancy was revolving all this in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind, and putting it to herself
whether it was worth while to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) troubles to Elizabeth, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
advice in getting out of them, the witch spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You be down--proper down,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) said suddenly, dropping another potato
into the bucket.

<p/>Fancy took no notice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About your young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Fancy reddened. Elizabeth seemed to be watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts. Really,
one would almost think she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must have the powers people ascribed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father not in the humour for`t, hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another potato was finished and
flung in. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I know about it. Little birds tell me things that people
don't dream of my knowing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Fancy was desperate about Dick, and here was a chance--O, such a wicked
chance--of getting help; and what was goodness beside love!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd tell me how to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) in the humour for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I could soon do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the witch quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really? O, do; anyhow--I don't care--so that it is done! How could I
do it, Mrs. Endorfield?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing so mighty wonderful in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By witchery, of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Elizabeth Endorfield</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis, I assure ye. Didn't you ever hear I was a witch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>hesitated Fancy, <div class="bookquote">``I have heard you called so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you believed it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say that I did exactly believe it, for `tis very horrible and
wicked; but, O, how I do wish it was possible for you to be one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I am. And I'll tell you how to bewitch your father to let you marry
Dick Dewy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>), poor thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurt who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; the charm is worked by common sense, and the spell can only be broke
by your acting stupidly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Elizabeth Endorfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Fancy looked rather perplexed, and Elizabeth went on:

<p/>``This fear of Lizz--whatever `tis--
By great and small;
She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) makes pretence to common sense,
And that's all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must do it like this.''  (<font color='red'><b>The witch</b></font>)</div>The witch laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knife and potato,
and then poured into Fancy's ear a long and detailed list of directions,
glancing up from the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eye into Fancy's face with an
expression of sinister humour. Fancy's face brightened, clouded, rose
and sank, as the narrative proceeded. <div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Elizabeth Endorfield</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth at length,
stooping for the knife and another potato, <div class="bookquote">``do that, and you'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
by-long and by-late, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Elizabeth Endorfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do it I will!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attention to the external world once more. The rain
continued as usual, but the wind had abated considerably during the
discourse. Judging that it was now possible to keep an umbrella erect,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hood again over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) bonnet, bade the witch good-bye, and
went her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) way.



<p/>CHAPTER IV: THE SPELL


<p/>Mrs. Endorfield's advice was duly followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I be proper sorry that your daughter isn't so well as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might be,''
 (<font color='red'><b>a Mellstock man</b></font>)</div>said a Mellstock man to Geoffrey one morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But is there anything in it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey uneasily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)
hat to the right. <div class="bookquote">``I can't understand the report. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) didn't complain
to me a bit when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No appetite at all, they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div><p/>Geoffrey crossed to Mellstock and called at the school that afternoon.
Fancy welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) as usual, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) to stay and take tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I be'n't much for tea, this time o' day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) said, but stayed.

<p/>During the meal he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Endorfield</b></font>) narrowly. And to his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) great consternation
discovered the following unprecedented change in the healthy girl--that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cut herself only a diaphanous slice of bread-and-butter, and, laying
it on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) plate, passed the meal-time in breaking it into pieces, but
eating no more than about one-tenth of the slice. Geoffrey hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
would say something about Dick, and finish up by weeping, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had done
after the decision against him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) a few days subsequent to the interview in
the garden. But nothing was said, and in due time Geoffrey departed
again for Yalbury Wood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis to be hoped poor Miss Fancy will be able to keep on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) school,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yalbury Wood</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey's man Enoch to Geoffrey the following week, as they were
shovelling up ant-hills in the wood.

<p/>Geoffrey stuck in the shovel, swept seven or eight ants from his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) sleeve,
and killed another that was prowling round his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) ear, then looked
perpendicularly into the earth as usual, waiting for Enoch to say more.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>said the keeper at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The baker told me yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Enoch</b></font>)</div>continued Enoch, shaking out another emmet
that had run merrily up his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) thigh, <div class="bookquote">``that the bread he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>)'ve left at that
there school-house this last month would starve any mouse in the three
creations; that `twould so! And afterwards I had a pint o' small down at
Morrs's, and there I heard more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Enoch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What might that ha' been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) used to have a pound o' the best rolled butter a week, regular
as clockwork, from Dairyman Viney's for herself, as well as just so much
salted for the helping girl, and the `ooman she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) calls in; but now the
same quantity d'last her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) three weeks, and then `tis thoughted she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throws
it away sour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Finish doing the emmets, and carry the bag home-along.''  (<font color='red'><b>The keeper</b></font>)</div>The keeper
resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) gun, tucked it under his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) arm, and went on without whistling
to the dogs, who however followed, with a bearing meant to imply that
they did not expect any such attentions when their master was reflecting.

<p/>On Saturday morning a note came from Fancy. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was not to trouble about
sending her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the couple of rabbits, as was intended, because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feared
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should not want them. Later in the day Geoffrey went to Casterbridge
and called upon the butcher who served Fancy with fresh meat, which was
put down to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father's account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've called to pay up our little bill, Neighbour Haylock, and you can
gie me the chiel's account at the same time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Haylock turned round three quarters of a circle in the midst of a
heap of joints, altered the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face from meat to money,
went into a little office consisting only of a door and a window, looked
very vigorously into a book which possessed length but no breadth; and
then, seizing a piece of paper and scribbling thereupon, handed the bill.

<p/>Probably it was the first time in the history of commercial transactions
that the quality of shortness in a butcher's bill was a cause of
tribulation to the debtor. <div class="bookquote">``Why, this isn't all she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ve had in a whole
month!''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every mossel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the butcher</b></font>)</div>said the butcher--<div class="bookquote">''-LRB-now, Dan, take that leg and shoulder
to Mrs. White's, and this eleven pound here to Mr. Martin's-RRB---you've been
treating her (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) to smaller joints lately, to my thinking, Mr. Day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the butcher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only two or three little scram rabbits this last week, as I am alive--I
wish I had!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, my wife said to me---LRB-Dan! not too much, not too much on that tray
at a time; better go twice-RRB---my wife said to me as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) posted up the
books: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says, ``Miss Day must have been affronted this summer during
that hot muggy weather that spolit so much for us; for depend upon<div class="bookquote">``t,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) says, `she (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)'ve been trying John Grimmett unknown to us: see her (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)
account else.'' <div class="bookquote">``Tis little, of course, at the best of times, being only
for one, but now `tis next kin to nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll inquire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey despondingly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) returned by way of Mellstock, and called upon Fancy, in fulfilment of
a promise. It being Saturday, the children were enjoying a holiday, and
on entering the residence Fancy was nowhere to be seen. Nan, the
charwoman, was sweeping the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's my da`ter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>said the keeper.

<p/>``Well, you see she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was tired with the week's teaching, and this morning
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, ``Nan, I sha'n't get up till the evening.<div class="bookquote">'' You see, Mr. Day, if
people don't eat, they can't work; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Nan</b></font>)'ve gie'd up eating, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nan</b></font>)
must gie up working.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have ye carried up any dinner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nan</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Nan</b></font>) don't want any. There, we all know that such things don't come
without good reason--not that I wish to say anything about a broken
heart, or anything of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div><p/>Geoffrey's own heart felt inconveniently large just then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) went to the
staircase and ascended to his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) daughter's door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div><p/>To see a person in bed from any cause whatever, on a fine afternoon, is
depressing enough; and here was his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) only child Fancy, not only in bed,
but looking very pale. Geoffrey was visibly disturbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy, I didn't expect to see thee here, chiel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What's the
matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not well, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I think of things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What things can you have to think o' so mortal much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I've been cruel to thee in saying that that penniless Dick o'
thine sha'n't marry thee, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, Fancy, I do it for the best, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) isn't good enough
for thee. You know that well enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) again looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lay. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Fancy, I can't let my only chiel die; and if you can't
live without en, you must ha' en, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) like that; all against your will, and everything so
disobedient!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sighed the invalid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, `tisn't against my will. My wish is, now I d'see how `tis
hurten thee to live without en, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) shall marry thee as soon as we've
considered a little. That's my wish flat and plain, Fancy. There, never
cry, my little maid! You ought to ha' cried afore; no need o' crying now
`tis all over. Well, howsoever, try to step over and see me and mother-
law to-morrow, and ha' a bit of dinner wi' us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And--Dick too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, Dick too, `far's I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when do you think you'll have considered, father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may marry
me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) coaxed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there, say next Midsummer; that's not a day too long to wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div><p/>On leaving the school Geoffrey went to the tranter's. Old William opened
the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your grandson Dick in `ithin, William?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not just now, Mr. Day. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'ve been at home a good deal
lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, how's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What wi' one thing, and what wi' t`other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'s all in a mope, as might
be said. Don't seem the feller he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) used to. Ay, 'a will sit studding and
thinking as if 'a were going to turn chapel-member, and then do nothing
but traypse and wamble about. Used to be such a chatty boy, too, Dick
did; and now 'a don't speak at all. But won't ye step inside? Reuben
will be home soon, 'a b`lieve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, I can't stay now. Will ye just ask Dick if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'ll do me
the kindness to step over to Yalbury to-morrow with my da`ter Fancy, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s well enough? I don't like her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to come by herself, now she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s not so
terrible topping in health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I've heard. Ay, sure, I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) without fail.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V: AFTER GAINING HER POINT


<p/>The visit to Geoffrey passed off as delightfully as a visit might have
been expected to pass off when it was the first day of smooth experience
in a hitherto obstructed love-course. And then came a series of several
happy days, of the same undisturbed serenity. Dick could court her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) chose; stay away when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) chose,--which was never; walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) by
winding streams and waterfalls and autumn scenery till dews and twilight
sent them home. And thus they drew near the day of the Harvest
Thanksgiving, which was also the time chosen for opening the organ in
Mellstock Church.

<p/>It chanced that Dick on that very day was called away from Mellstock. A
young acquaintance had died of consumption at Charmley, a neighbouring
village, on the previous Monday, and Dick, in fulfilment of a
long-standing promise, was to assist in carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) to the grave. When
on Tuesday, Dick went towards the school to acquaint Fancy with the fact,
it is difficult to say whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) own disappointment at being denied the
sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) triumphant debut as organist, was greater than his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) vexation
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) pet should on this great occasion be deprived of the pleasure of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) presence. However, the intelligence was communicated. She (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) bore it
as she (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) best could, not without many expressions of regret, and
convictions that her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) performance would be nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) now.

<p/>Just before eleven o'clock on Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) set out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) sad errand. The
funeral was to be immediately after the morning service, and as there
were four good miles to walk, driving being inconvenient, it became
necessary to start comparatively early. Half an hour later would
certainly have answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) purpose quite as well, yet at the last moment
nothing would content his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) ardent mind but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) must go a mile out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) way in the direction of the school, in the hope of getting a glimpse
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) Love as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) started for church.

<p/>Striking, therefore, into the lane towards the school, instead of across
the ewelease direct to Charmley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) arrived opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) door as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
goddess emerged.

<p/>If ever a woman looked a divinity, Fancy Day appeared one that morning as
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) floated down those school steps, in the form of a nebulous collection
of colours inclining to blue. With an audacity unparalleled in the whole
history of village-school-mistresses at this date--partly owing, no
doubt, to papa's respectable accumulation of cash, which rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
profession not altogether one of necessity--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had actually donned a hat
and feather, and lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hitherto plainly looped-up hair, which now
fell about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulders in a profusion of curls. Poor Dick was
astonished: he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look so distractingly beautiful before,
save on Christmas-eve, when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was in the same luxuriant condition
of freedom. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) first burst of delighted surprise was followed by
less comfortable feelings, as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) brain recovered its power to
think.

<p/>Fancy had blushed;--was it with confusion? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had also involuntarily
pressed back her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) curls. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy, you didn't know me for a moment in my funeral clothes, did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning, Dick--no, really, I didn't know you for an instant in such
a sad suit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) looked again at the gay tresses and hat. <div class="bookquote">``You've never dressed so
charming before, dearest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to hear you praise me in that way, Dick,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, smiling
archly. <div class="bookquote">``It is meat and drink to a woman. Do I look nice really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie! you know it. Did you remember,--I mean didn't you remember about
my going away to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, I did, Dick; but, you know, I wanted to look well;--forgive
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, darling; yes, of course,--there's nothing to forgive. No, I was
only thinking that when we talked on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday
and Friday about my absence to-day, and I was so sorry for it, you said,
Fancy, so were you sorry, and almost cried, and said it would be no
pleasure to you to be the attraction of the church to-day, since I could
not be there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear one, neither will it be so much pleasure to me ... But I do
take a little delight in my life, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apart from mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) with perplexed eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I know you are vexed with me,
Dick, and it is because the first Sunday I have curls and a hat and
feather since I have been here happens to be the very day you are away
and won't be with me. Yes, say it is, for that is it! And you think
that all this week I ought to have remembered you wouldn't be here to-
day, and not have cared to be better dressed than usual. Yes, you do,
Dick, and it is rather unkind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick earnestly and simply, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't think so badly of you
as that. I only thought that--if you had been going away, I shouldn't
have tried new attractions for the eyes of other people. But then of
course you and I are different, naturally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever will the vicar say, Fancy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't fear what he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) says in the least!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered proudly. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)
won't say anything of the sort you think. No, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) can hardly have conscience to, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now come, you say, Dick, that you quite forgive me, for I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said with sudden gaiety, and skipped backwards into the porch. <div class="bookquote">``Come
here, sir;--say you forgive me, and then you shall kiss me;--you never
have yet when I have worn curls, you know. Yes, just where you want to
so much,--yes, you may!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into the inner corner, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was probably not slow
in availing himself of the privilege offered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that's a treat for you, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, or I
shall be late. Come and see me to-morrow: you'll be tired to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus they parted, and Fancy proceeded to the church. The organ stood on
one side of the chancel, close to and under the immediate eye of the
vicar when he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) was in the pulpit, and also in full view of the
congregation. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down, for the first time in such a
conspicuous position, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seat having previously been in a remote spot in
the aisle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens--disgraceful! Curls and a hat and feather!''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughters hat feather</b></font>)</div>said the
daughters of the small gentry, who had either only curly hair without a
hat and feather, or a hat and feather without curly hair. <div class="bookquote">``A bonnet for
church always,''  (<font color='red'><b>matrons</b></font>)</div>said sober matrons.

<p/>That Mr. Maybold was conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presence close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) during
the sermon; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) was not at all angry at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) development of costume;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perceived. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) loved
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) during that sermon-time as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) had never loved a woman before; that
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) proximity was a strange delight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) gloried in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
musical success that morning in a spirit quite beyond a mere cleric's
glory at the inauguration of a new order of things.

<p/>The old choir, with humbled hearts, no longer took their seats in the
gallery as heretofore -LRB-which was now given up to the school-children who
were not singers, and a pupil-teacher-RRB-, but were scattered about with
their wives in different parts of the church. Having nothing to do with
conducting the service for almost the first time in their lives, they all
felt awkward, out of place, abashed, and inconvenienced by their hands.
The tranter had proposed that they should stay away to-day and go
nutting, but grandfather William would not hear of such a thing for a
moment. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) replied reproachfully, and quoted a verse: <div class="bookquote">``Though this
has come upon us, let not our hearts be turned back, or our steps go out
of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So they stood and watched the curls of hair trailing down the back of the
successful rival, and the waving of her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) feather, as she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) swayed her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) head.
After a few timid notes and uncertain touches her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) playing became markedly
correct, and towards the end full and free. But, whether from prejudice
or unbiassed judgment, the venerable body of musicians could not help
thinking that the simpler notes they had been wont to bring forth were
more in keeping with the simplicity of their old church than the crowded
chords and interludes it was her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pleasure to produce.



<p/>CHAPTER VI: INTO TEMPTATION


<p/>The day was done, and Fancy was again in the school-house. About five
o'clock it began to rain, and in rather a dull frame of mind she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wandered
into the schoolroom, for want of something better to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
thinking--of her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lover Dick Dewy? Not precisely. Of how weary she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
of living alone: how unbearable it would be to return to Yalbury under
the rule of her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) strange-tempered step-mother; that it was far better to
be married to anybody than do that; that eight or nine long months had
yet to be lived through ere the wedding could take place.

<p/>At the side of the room were high windows of Ham-hill stone, upon either
sill of which she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could sit by first mounting a desk and using it as a
footstool. As the evening advanced here she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) perched herself, as was her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
custom on such wet and gloomy occasions, put on a light shawl and bonnet,
opened the window, and looked out at the rain.

<p/>The window overlooked a field called the Grove, and it was the position
from which she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) used to survey the crown of Dick's passing hat in the
early days of their acquaintance and meetings. Not a living soul was now
visible anywhere; the rain kept all people indoors who were not forced
abroad by necessity, and necessity was less importunate on Sundays than
during the week.

<p/>Sitting here and thinking again--of her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lover, or of the sensation she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
had created at church that day?--well, it is unknown--thinking and
thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) saw a dark masculine figure arising into distinctness at the
further end of the Grove--a man without an umbrella. Nearer and nearer
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came, and she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in deep mourning, and then that it
was Dick. Yes, in the fondness and foolishness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) young heart, after
walking four miles, in a drizzling rain without overcoat or umbrella, and
in face of a remark from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) love that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was not to come because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
would be tired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had made it his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) business to wander this mile out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) way again, from sheer wish of spending ten minutes in her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Dick, how wet you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) drew up under the window.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, your coat shines as if it had been varnished, and your hat--my
goodness, there's a streaming hat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I don't mind, darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``Wet never hurts me,
though I am rather sorry for my best clothes. However, it couldn't be
helped; we lent all the umbrellas to the women. I don't know when I
shall get mine back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And look, there's a nasty patch of something just on your shoulder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's japanning; it rubbed off the clamps of poor Jack's coffin
when we lowered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) from our shoulders upon the bier! I don't care about
that, for 'twas the last deed I could do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>); and `tis hard if you
can't afford a coat for an old friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Fancy put her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mouth for half a minute. Underneath the palm
of that little hand there existed for that half-minute a little yawn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dick, I don't like you to stand there in the wet. And you mustn't sit
down. Go home and change your things. Don't stay another minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One kiss after coming so far,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can reach, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) looked rather disappointed at not being invited round to the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
twisted from her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seated position and bent herself downwards, but not even
by standing on the plinth was it possible for Dick to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) lips into
contact with hers as she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) held them. By great exertion she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might have
reached a little lower; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would have exposed her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) head to the
rain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Dick; kiss my hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, flinging it down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Now, good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) walked slowly away, turning and turning again to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
was out of sight. During the retreat she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said to herself, almost
involuntarily, and still conscious of that morning's triumph--<div class="bookquote">``I like
Dick, and I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>); but how plain and sorry a man looks in the rain,
with no umbrella, and wet through!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) vanished, she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) made as if to descend from her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seat; but glancing in
the other direction she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) saw another form coming along the same track. It
was also that of a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, was in black from top to toe; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
carried an umbrella.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew nearer, and the direction of the rain caused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so to slant his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
umbrella that from her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) height above the ground his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head was invisible, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was also to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed in due time directly beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and in
looking down upon the exterior of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) umbrella her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) feminine eyes
perceived it to be of superior silk--less common at that date than
since--and of elegant make. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the entrance to the building, and
Fancy suddenly lost sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Instead of pursuing the roadway as
Dick had done he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) had turned sharply round into her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) own porch.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) jumped to the floor, hastily flung off her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shawl and bonnet, smoothed
and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hair till the curls hung in passable condition, and
listened. No knock. Nearly a minute passed, and still there was no
knock. Then there arose a soft series of raps, no louder than the
tapping of a distant woodpecker, and barely distinct enough to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
ears. She (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) composed herself and flung open the door.

<p/>In the porch stood Mr. Maybold.

<p/>There was a warm flush upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) face, and a bright flash in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) eyes,
which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) look handsomer than she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-evening, Miss Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-evening, Mr. Maybold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, in a strange state of mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
had noticed, beyond the ardent hue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) face, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) voice had a
singular tremor in it, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) hand shook like an aspen leaf when he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)
laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) umbrella in the corner of the porch. Without another word being
spoken by either, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) came into the schoolroom, shut the door, and moved
close to her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). Once inside, the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) face was no more
discernible, by reason of the increasing dusk of evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) then said; <div class="bookquote">``seriously--on a perhaps
unexpected subject, but one which is all the world to me--I don't know
what it may be to you, Miss Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy, I have come to ask you if you will be my wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div><p/>As a person who has been idly amusing himself with rolling a snowball
might start at finding he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) had set in motion an avalanche, so did Fancy
start at these words from the vicar. And in the dead silence which
followed them, the breathings of the man and of the woman could be
distinctly and separately heard; and there was this difference between
them--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) respirations gradually grew quieter and less rapid after the
enunciation, hers, from having been low and regular, increased in
quickness and force, till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) almost panted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot, I cannot, Mr. Maybold--I cannot! Don't ask me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't answer in a hurry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entreated. <div class="bookquote">``And do listen to me. This is
no sudden feeling on my part. I have loved you for more than six months!
Perhaps my late interest in teaching the children here has not been so
single-minded as it seemed. You will understand my motive--like me
better, perhaps, for honestly telling you that I have struggled against
my emotion continually, because I have thought that it was not well for
me to love you! But I resolved to struggle no longer; I have examined
the feeling; and the love I bear you is as genuine as that I could bear
any woman! I see your great charm; I respect your natural talents, and
the refinement they have brought into your nature--they are quite enough,
and more than enough for me! They are equal to anything ever required of
the mistress of a quiet parsonage-house--the place in which I shall pass
my days, wherever it may be situated. O Fancy, I have watched you,
criticized you even severely, brought my feelings to the light of
judgment, and still have found them rational, and such as any man might
have expected to be inspired with by a woman like you! So there is
nothing hurried, secret, or untoward in my desire to do this. Fancy,
will you marry me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No answer was returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't refuse; don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) implored. <div class="bookquote">``It would be foolish of you--I mean
cruel! Of course we would not live here, Fancy. I have had for a long
time the offer of an exchange of livings with a friend in Yorkshire, but
I have hitherto refused on account of my mother. There we would go. Your
musical powers shall be still further developed; you shall have whatever
pianoforte you like; you shall have anything, Fancy, anything to make you
happy--pony-carriage, flowers, birds, pleasant society; yes, you have
enough in you for any society, after a few months of travel with me! Will
you, Fancy, marry me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Another pause ensued, varied only by the surging of the rain against the
window-panes, and then Fancy spoke, in a faint and broken voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, my own!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advanced quickly, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm out to
embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew back hastily. <div class="bookquote">``No no, not now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said in an
agitated whisper. <div class="bookquote">``There are things;--but the temptation is, O, too
strong, and I can't resist it; I can't tell you now, but I must tell you!
Don't, please, don't come near me now! I want to think, I can scarcely
get myself used to the idea of what I have promised yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The next
minute she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned to a desk, buried her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, and burst into
a hysterical fit of weeping. <div class="bookquote">``O, leave me to myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sobbed; <div class="bookquote">``leave
me! O, leave me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be distressed; don't, dearest!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was with visible difficulty
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) restrained himself from approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You shall tell me at
your leisure what it is that grieves you so; I am happy--beyond all
measure happy!--at having your simple promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do go and leave me now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must not, in justice to you, leave for a minute, until you are
yourself again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, controlling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) emotion, and standing up; <div class="bookquote">``I am
not disturbed now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reluctantly moved towards the door. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murmured tenderly.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll come to-morrow about this time.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VII: SECOND THOUGHTS


<p/>The next morning the vicar rose early. The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) did was to
write a long and careful letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) friend in Yorkshire. Then, eating
a little breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) crossed the meadows in the direction of
Casterbridge, bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) pocket, that he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) might post it at
the town office, and obviate the loss of one day in its transmission that
would have resulted had he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) left it for the foot-post through the village.

<p/>It was a foggy morning, and the trees shed in noisy water-drops the
moisture they had collected from the thick air, an acorn occasionally
falling from its cup to the ground, in company with the drippings. In
the meads, sheets of spiders'-web, almost opaque with wet, hung in folds
over the fences, and the falling leaves appeared in every variety of
brown, green, and yellow hue.

<p/>A low and merry whistling was heard on the highway he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) was approaching,
then the light footsteps of a man going in the same direction as himself.
On reaching the junction of his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) path with the road, the vicar beheld Dick
Dewy's open and cheerful face. Dick lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hat, and the vicar came
out into the highway that Dick was pursuing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning, Dewy. How well you are looking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Maybold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, I am well--quite well! I am going to Casterbridge now, to get
Smart's collar; we left it there Saturday to be repaired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to Casterbridge, so we'll walk together,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>the vicar said.
Dick gave a hop with one foot to put himself in step with Mr. Maybold,
who proceeded: <div class="bookquote">``I fancy I didn't see you at church yesterday, Dewy. Or
were you behind the pier?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I went to Charmley. Poor John Dunford chose me to be one of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
bearers a long time before he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) died, and yesterday was the funeral. Of
course I couldn't refuse, though I should have liked particularly to have
been at home as 'twas the day of the new music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you should have been. The musical portion of the service was
successful--very successful indeed; and what is more to the purpose, no
ill-feeling whatever was evinced by any of the members of the old choir.
They joined in the singing with the greatest good-will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'''Twas natural enough that I should want to be there, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said
Dick, smiling a private smile; <div class="bookquote">``considering who the organ-player was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>At this the vicar reddened a little, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>this the vicar</b></font>)</div>though not at
all comprehending Dick's true meaning, who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) received no further
reply, continued hesitatingly, and with another smile denoting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) pride
as a lover--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you know what I mean, sir? You've heard about me and--Miss
Day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lover</b></font>)</div><p/>The red in Maybold's countenance went away: he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) turned and looked Dick in
the face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said constrainedly, <div class="bookquote">``I've heard nothing whatever about you and
Miss Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s my sweetheart, and we are going to be married next Midsummer.
We are keeping it rather close just at present, because `tis a good many
months to wait; but it is her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father's wish that we don't marry before,
and of course we must submit. But the time `ill soon slip along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the time will soon slip along--Time glides away every day--yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div><p/>Maybold said these words, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) had no idea of what they were. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) was
conscious of a cold and sickly thrill throughout him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>); and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) reasoned
was this that the young creature whose graces had intoxicated him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) into
making the most imprudent resolution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) life, was less an angel than
a woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>continued the ingenuous Dick, <div class="bookquote">''`twill be better in one
sense. I shall by that time be the regular manager of a branch o'
father's business, which has very much increased lately, and business,
which we think of starting elsewhere. It has very much increased lately,
and we expect next year to keep a' extra couple of horses. We've already
our eye on one--brown as a berry, neck like a rainbow, fifteen hands, and
not a gray hair in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--offered us at twenty-five want a crown. And to
kip pace with the times I have had some cards prented and I beg leave to
hand you one, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div>said the vicar, mechanically taking the card that Dick
offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I turn in here by Grey's Bridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you go straight
on and up town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning, Dewy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maybold/Maybold/MR. MAYBOLD</b></font>)</div><p/>Maybold stood still upon the bridge, holding the card as it had been put
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hand, and Dick's footsteps died away towards Durnover Mill. The
vicar's first voluntary action was to read the card:--

<p/>DEWY AND SON,
TRANTERS AND HAULIERS,
MELLSTOCK.
NB.--Furniture, Coals, Potatoes, Live and Dead Stock, removed to any
distance on the shortest notice.

<p/>Mr. Maybold leant over the parapet of the bridge and looked into the
river. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) saw--without heeding--how the water came rapidly from beneath
the arches, glided down a little steep, then spread itself over a pool in
which dace, trout, and minnows sported at ease among the long green locks
of weed that lay heaving and sinking with their roots towards the
current. At the end of ten minutes spent leaning thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)
pocket the letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) friend, tore it deliberately into such minute
fragments that scarcely two syllables remained in juxtaposition, and sent
the whole handful of shreds fluttering into the water. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) watched
them eddy, dart, and turn, as they were carried downwards towards the
ocean and gradually disappeared from his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) view. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) moved off, and
pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) way at a rapid pace back again to Mellstock Vicarage.

<p/>Nerving himself by a long and intense effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) sat down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) study
and wrote as follows:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DEAR MISS DAY,--The meaning of your words, `the temptation is too
strong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of your sadness and your tears, has been brought home to me
by an accident. I know to-day what I did not know yesterday--that you
are not a free woman.

<p/>``Why did you not tell me--why didn't you? Did you suppose I knew? No.
Had I known, my conduct in coming to you as I did would have been
reprehensible.

<p/>``But I don't chide you! Perhaps no blame attaches to you--I can't
tell. Fancy, though my opinion of you is assailed and disturbed in a
way which cannot be expressed, I love you still, and my word to you
holds good yet. But will you, in justice to an honest man who relies
upon your word to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), consider whether, under the circumstances, you
can honourably forsake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?--Yours ever sincerely,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``ARTHUR MAYBOLD.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) rang the bell. <div class="bookquote">``Tell Charles to take these copybooks and this note to
the school at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The maid</b></font>)</div><p/>The maid took the parcel and the letter, and in a few minutes a boy was
seen to leave the vicarage gate, with the one under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm, and the
other in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand. The vicar sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) brow, watching the
lad as he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) descended Church Lane and entered the waterside path which
intervened between that spot and the school.

<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) was met by another boy, and after a free salutation and
pugilistic frisk had passed between the two, the second boy came on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
way to the vicarage, and the other vanished out of sight.

<p/>The boy came to the door, and a note for Mr. Maybold was brought in.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) knew the writing. Opening the envelope with an unsteady hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) read
the subjoined words:

<p/>``DEAR MR. MAYBOLD,--I have been thinking seriously and sadly through
the whole of the night of the question you put to me last evening and
of my answer. That answer, as an honest woman, I had no right to
give.

<p/>``It is my nature--perhaps all women's--to love refinement of mind and
manners; but even more than this, to be ever fascinated with the idea
of surroundings more elegant and pleasing than those which have been
customary. And you praised me, and praise is life to me. It was
alone my sensations at these things which prompted my reply. Ambition
and vanity they would be called; perhaps they are so.

<p/>``After this explanation I hope you will generously allow me to
withdraw the answer I too hastily gave.

<p/>``And one more request. To keep the meeting of last night, and all
that passed between us there, for ever a secret. Were it to become
known, it would utterly blight the happiness of a trusting and
generous man, whom I love still, and shall love always.--Yours
sincerely,

<p/>``FANCY DAY.

<p/>The last written communication that ever passed from the vicar to Fancy,
was a note containing these words only:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) everything; it is best. He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) will forgive you.''




 (<font color='red'><b>the vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>PART THE FIFTH: CONCLUSION


<p/>CHAPTER I: ``THE KNOT THERE``S NO UNTYING'


<p/>The last day of the story is dated just subsequent to that point in the
development of the seasons when country people go to bed among nearly
naked trees, are lulled to sleep by a fall of rain, and awake next
morning among green ones; when the landscape appears embarrassed with the
sudden weight and brilliancy of its leaves; when the night-jar comes and
strikes up for the summer his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) tune of one note; when the apple-trees have
bloomed, and the roads and orchard-grass become spotted with fallen
petals; when the faces of the delicate flowers are darkened, and their
heads weighed down, by the throng of honey-bees, which increase their
humming till humming is too mild a term for the all-pervading sound; and
when cuckoos, blackbirds, and sparrows, that have hitherto been merry and
respectful neighbours, become noisy and persistent intimates.

<p/>The exterior of Geoffrey Day's house in Yalbury Wood appeared exactly as
was usual at that season, but a frantic barking of the dogs at the back
told of unwonted movements somewhere within. Inside the door the eyes
beheld a gathering, which was a rarity indeed for the dwelling of the
solitary wood-steward and keeper.

<p/>About the room were sitting and standing, in various gnarled attitudes,
our old acquaintance, grandfathers James and William, the tranter, Mr.
Penny, two or three children, including Jimmy and Charley, besides three
or four country ladies and gentlemen from a greater distance who do not
require any distinction by name. Geoffrey was seen and heard stamping
about the outhouse and among the bushes of the garden, attending to
details of daily routine before the proper time arrived for their
performance, in order that they might be off his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) hands for the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)
appeared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) shirt-sleeves rolled up; his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) best new nether garments,
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) had arrayed himself that morning, being temporarily disguised
under a weekday apron whilst these proceedings were in operation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)
occasionally glanced at the hives in passing, to see if his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) wife's bees
were swarming, ultimately rolling down his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) shirt-sleeves and going
indoors, talking to tranter Dewy whilst buttoning the wristbands, to save
time; next going upstairs for his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) best waistcoat, and coming down again
to make another remark whilst buttoning that, during the time looking
fixedly in the tranter's face as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) were a looking-glass.

<p/>The furniture had undergone attenuation to an alarming extent, every
duplicate piece having been removed, including the clock by Thomas Wood;
Ezekiel Saunders being at last left sole referee in matters of time.

<p/>Fancy was stationary upstairs, receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) layers of clothes and
adornments, and answering by short fragments of laughter which had more
fidgetiness than mirth in them, remarks that were made from time to time
by Mrs. Dewy and Mrs. Penny, who were assisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) at the toilet, Mrs.
Day having pleaded a queerness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) head as a reason for shutting
herself up in an inner bedroom for the whole morning. Mrs. Penny
appeared with nine corkscrew curls on each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) temples, and a
back comb stuck upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) crown like a castle on a steep.

<p/>The conversation just now going on was concerning the banns, the last
publication of which had been on the Sunday previous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how did they sound?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Fancy subtly inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very beautiful indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard any sound
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, so natural and elegant, didn't they, Reuben!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) cried, through the
chinks of the unceiled floor, to the tranter downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, looking up inquiringly at the floor
above him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) for an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't Dick and Fancy sound well when they were called home in church
last Sunday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>came downwards again in Mrs. Penny's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that they did, my sonnies!--especially the first time. There was a
terrible whispering piece of work in the congregation, wasn't there,
neighbour Penny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, taking up the thread of conversation
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) own account and, in order to be heard in the room above, speaking
very loud to Mr. Penny, who sat at the distance of three feet from him (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>),
or rather less.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never can mind seeing such a whispering as there was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny,
also loudly, to the room above. <div class="bookquote">``And such sorrowful envy on the maidens'
faces; really, I never did see such envy as there was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Fancy's lineaments varied in innumerable little flushes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) heart
palpitated innumerable little tremors of pleasure. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>)
said, with assumed indifference, <div class="bookquote">``it was only because no religion was
going on just then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>``O, no; nothing to do with that. <div class="bookquote">``Twas because of your high standing in
the parish. It was just as if they had one and all caught Dick kissing
and coling ye to death, wasn't it, Mrs. Dewy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay; that 'twas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How people will talk about one's doings!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Fancy exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you make songs about yourself, my dear, you can't blame other
people for singing 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy me! how shall I go through it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady face</b></font>)</div>said the young lady again, but
merely to those in the bedroom, with a breathing of a kind between a sigh
and a pant, round shining eyes, and warm face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, you'll get through it well enough, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dewy placidly.
<div class="bookquote">``The edge of the performance is took off at the calling home; and when
once you get up to the chancel end o' the church, you feel as saucy as
you please. I'm sure I felt as brave as a sodger all through the
deed--though of course I dropped my face and looked modest, as was
becoming to a maid. Mind you do that, Fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I walked into the church as quiet as a lamb, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>subjoined
Mrs. Penny. <div class="bookquote">``There, you see Penny is such a little small man. But
certainly, I was flurried in the inside o' me. Well, thinks I, `tis to
be, and here goes! And do you do the same: say, '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`Tis to be, and here
goes!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there such wonderful virtue in '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`Tis to be, and here goes!''' inquired
Fancy.

<p/>``Wonderful! <div class="bookquote">``Twill carry a body through it all from wedding to
churching, if you only let it out with spirit enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, blushing. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis to be, and here goes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a girl for a husband!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do hope he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll come in time!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the bride-elect, inventing a
new cause of affright, now that the other was demolished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Twould be a thousand pities if he (<font color='blue'><b>pant</b></font>) didn't come, now you be so brave,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny.

<p/>Grandfather James, having overheard some of these remarks, said
downstairs with mischievous loudness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've known some would-be weddings when the men didn't come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've happened not to come, before now, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny,
cleaning one of the glasses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) spectacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, do hear what they are saying downstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered Fancy. <div class="bookquote">``Hush,
hush!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) listened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have, haven't they, Geoffrey?''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>continued grandfather James, as
Geoffrey entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The men have been known not to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That they have,''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>said the keeper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay; I've knowed times when the wedding had to be put off through his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) not
appearing, being tired of the woman. And another case I knowed was when
the man was catched in a man-trap crossing Oaker's Wood, and the three
months had run out before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) got well, and the banns had to be published
over again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How horrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They only say it on purpose to tease `ee, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis quite sad to think what wretched shifts poor maids have been put
to,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came again from downstairs. <div class="bookquote">``Ye should hear Clerk Wilkins, my
brother-law, tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilkins</b></font>) experiences in marrying couples these last thirty
year: sometimes one thing, sometimes another--`tis quite
heart-rending--enough to make your hair stand on end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those things don't happen very often, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, with
smouldering uneasiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, really `tis time Dick was here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't keep on at me so, grandfather James and Mr. Dewy, and all you down
there!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Fancy broke out, unable to endure any longer. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I shall
die, or do something, if you do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you hearken to these old chaps, Miss Day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nat Callcome/Nat</b></font>)</div>cried Nat Callcome, the
best man, who had just entered, and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice upward through the
chinks of the floor as the others had done. ''`Tis all right; Dick's
coming on like a wild feller; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'ll be here in a minute. The hive o'
bees his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) mother gie'd en for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) new garden swarmed jist as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was
starting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, ``I can't afford to lose a stock o' bees; no, that
I can't, though I fain would; and Fancy wouldn't wish it on any account.<div class="bookquote">''
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) jist stopped to ting to 'em and shake 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A genuine wise man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, what a day's work we had yesterday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Callcome continued,
lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) voice as if it were not necessary any longer to include
those in the room above among his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) audience, and selecting a remote corner
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) best clean handkerchief for wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``To be sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things so heavy, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey, as if reading through the
chimney-window from the far end of the vista.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nat Callcome/Nat</b></font>)</div>said Nat, looking round the room at points from which furniture had
been removed. ``And so awkward to carry, too. <div class="bookquote">``Twas ath`art and across
Dick's garden; in and out Dick's door; up and down Dick's stairs; round
and round Dick's chammers till legs were worn to stumps: and Dick is so
particular, too. And the stores of victuals and drink that lad has laid
in: why, `tis enough for Noah's ark! I'm sure I never wish to see a
choicer half-dozen of hams than he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)'s got there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) chimley; and the
cider I tasted was a very pretty drop, indeed;--none could desire a
prettier cider.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They be for the love and the stalled ox both. Ah, the greedy martels!''
 (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said grandfather James.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, may-be they be. Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, <div class="bookquote">``that couple between 'em have
heaped up so much furniture and victuals, that anybody would think they
were going to take hold the big end of married life first, and begin wi'
a grown-up family. Ah, what a bath of heat we two chaps were in, to be
sure, a-getting that furniture in order!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do so wish the room below was ceiled,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, as the dressing
went on; <div class="bookquote">``we can hear all they say and do down there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark! Who's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed a small pupil-teacher, who also assisted
this morning, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) great delight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) ran half-way down the stairs,
and peeped round the banister. <div class="bookquote">``O, you should, you should, you should!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) exclaimed, scrambling up to the room again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy.

<p/>``See the bridesmaids! They've just a come! <div class="bookquote">``Tis wonderful, really! `tis
wonderful how muslin can be brought to it. There, they don't look a bit
like themselves, but like some very rich sisters o' theirs that nobody
knew they had!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make 'em come up to me, make 'em come up!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Fancy ecstatically; and
the four damsels appointed, namely, Miss Susan Dewy, Miss Bessie Dewy,
Miss Vashti Sniff, and Miss Mercy Onmey, surged upstairs, and floated
along the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Dick would come!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was again the burden of Fancy.

<p/>The same instant a small twig and flower from the creeper outside the
door flew in at the open window, and a masculine voice said, <div class="bookquote">``Ready,
Fancy dearest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Fancy, tittering spasmodically, and breathing
as it were for the first time that morning.

<p/>The bridesmaids crowded to the window and turned their heads in the
direction pointed out, at which motion eight earrings all swung as
one:--not looking at Dick because they particularly wanted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>),
but with an important sense of their duty as obedient ministers of the
will of that apotheosised being--the Bride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) looks very taking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Vashti Sniff/Vashti Sniff</b></font>)</div>said Miss Vashti Sniff, a young lady who blushed
cream-colour and wore yellow bonnet ribbons.

<p/>Dick was advancing to the door in a painfully new coat of shining cloth,
primrose-coloured waistcoat, hat of the same painful style of newness,
and with an extra quantity of whiskers shaved off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) face, and hair cut
to an unwonted shortness in honour of the occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I'll run down,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, looking at herself over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sniff</b></font>) shoulder in
the glass, and flitting off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sniff</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I am so glad you are come! I knew you would,
of course, but I thought, Oh if you shouldn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not come, Fancy! Het or wet, blow or snow, here come I to-day! Why,
what's possessing your little soul? You never used to mind such things a
bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Mr. Dick, I hadn't hoisted my colours and committed myself then!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a pity I can't marry the whole five of ye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, surveying
them all round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heh-heh-heh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the bridesmaids</b></font>)</div>laughed the four bridesmaids, and Fancy privately touched
Dick and smoothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) down behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) shoulder, as if to assure herself
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was there in flesh and blood as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sniff</b></font>) own property.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, whoever would have thought such a thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, taking off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hat, sinking into a chair, and turning to the elder members of the
company.

<p/>The latter arranged their eyes and lips to signify that in their opinion
nobody could have thought such a thing, whatever it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That my bees should ha' swarmed just then, of all times and seasons!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>continued Dick, throwing a comprehensive glance like a net over the whole
auditory. <div class="bookquote">``And `tis a fine swarm, too: I haven't seen such a fine swarm
for these ten years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A' excellent sign,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny, from the depths of experience. <div class="bookquote">``A'
excellent sign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad everything seems so right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy with a breath of
relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bridesmaids</b></font>)</div>said the four bridesmaids with much sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, bees can't be put off,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>observed the inharmonious grandfather
James. <div class="bookquote">``Marrying a woman is a thing you can do at any moment; but a
swarm o' bees won't come for the asking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/>Dick fanned himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``I can't think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said thoughtfully,
<div class="bookquote">``whatever 'twas I did to offend Mr. Maybold, a man I like so much too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)
rather took to me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) came first, and used to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) should like to
see me married, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>)'d marry me, whether the young woman I chose
lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) parish or no. I just hinted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) of it when I put in the
banns, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) didn't seem to take kindly to the notion now, and so I said
no more. I wonder how it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder!''  (<font color='red'><b>tranter wife</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, looking into vacancy with those beautiful eyes of
hers--too refined and beautiful for a tranter's wife; but, perhaps, not
too good.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Altered his (<font color='blue'><b>Maybold</b></font>) mind, as folks will, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
my sonnies, there'll be a good strong party looking at us to-day as we go
along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the body of the church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey, <div class="bookquote">``will be lined with females,
and a row of young fellers' heads, as far down as the eyes, will be
noticed just above the sills of the chancel-winders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, you've been through it twice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Reuben, <div class="bookquote">``and well mid know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reuben/Reuben Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can put up with it for once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, <div class="bookquote">``or twice either, or a dozen
times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, dear, that's nothing,--only just a bit of a flourish. You be as
nervous as a cat to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then, of course, when `tis all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the tranter, <div class="bookquote">``we
shall march two and two round the parish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny: <div class="bookquote">``two and two: every man hitched up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
woman, 'a b`lieve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never can make a show of myself in that way!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Fancy, looking at
Dick to ascertain if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm agreed to anything you and the company like, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dewy/Richard/Richard Dewy</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Richard Dewy heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, we did when we were married, didn't we, Ann?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter;
<div class="bookquote">``and so do everybody, my sonnies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so did we,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fancy father</b></font>)</div>said Fancy's father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so did Penny and I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny: <div class="bookquote">``I wore my best Bath clogs, I
remember, and Penny was cross because it made me look so tall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so did father and mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Mercy Onmey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I mean to, come next Christmas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nat Callcome/Nat</b></font>)</div>said Nat the groomsman vigorously,
and looking towards the person of Miss Vashti Sniff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Respectable people don't nowadays,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy. <div class="bookquote">``Still, since poor
mother did, I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>resumed the tranter, <div class="bookquote">'''twas on a White Tuesday when I committed it.
Mellstock Club walked the same day, and we new-married folk went a-gaying
round the parish behind 'em. Everybody used to wear something white at
Whitsuntide in them days. My sonnies, I've got the very white trousers
that I wore, at home in box now. Ha'n't I, Ann?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had till I cut 'em up for Jimmy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dewy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And we ought, by rights, after doing this parish, to go round Higher and
Lower Mellstock, and call at Viney's, and so work our way hither again
across He (<font color='blue'><b>Viney</b></font>)`th,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny, recovering scent of the matter in hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Dairyman Viney is a very respectable man, and so is Farmer Kex, and we
ought to show ourselves to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, <div class="bookquote">``we ought to go round Mellstock to do the thing
well. We shall form a very striking object walking along in rotation,
good-now, neighbours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we shall: a proper pretty sight for the nation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, suddenly catching sight of a singular human
figure standing in the doorway, and wearing a long smock-frock of pillow-
case cut and of snowy whiteness. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Leaf! whatever dost thou do
here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to know if so be I can come to the wedding--hee-hee!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said
Leaf in a voice of timidity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Leaf,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter reproachfully, <div class="bookquote">``you know we don't want `ee
here to-day: we've got no room for ye, Leaf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomas Leaf, Thomas Leaf, fie upon ye for prying!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I've got no head, but I thought, if I washed and put on a clane
shirt and smock-frock, I might just call,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said Leaf, turning away
disappointed and trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor feller!''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, turning to Geoffrey. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose we must
let en come? His (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) looks are rather against en, and he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) is terrible silly;
but 'a have never been in jail, and 'a won't do no harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaf looked with gratitude at the tranter for these praises, and then
anxiously at Geoffrey, to see what effect they would have in helping his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)
cause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, let en come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey decisively. <div class="bookquote">``Leaf, th`rt welcome, `st
know;''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>and Leaf accordingly remained.

<p/>They were now all ready for leaving the house, and began to form a
procession in the following order: Fancy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) father, Dick and Susan
Dewy, Nat Callcome and Vashti Sniff, Ted Waywood and Mercy Onmey, and
Jimmy and Bessie Dewy. These formed the executive, and all appeared in
strict wedding attire. Then came the tranter and Mrs. Dewy, and last of
all Mr. and Mrs. Penny;--the tranter conspicuous by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) enormous gloves,
size eleven and three-quarters, which appeared at a distance like boxing
gloves bleached, and sat rather awkwardly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) brown hands; this hall-
mark of respectability having been set upon himself to-day -LRB-by Fancy's
special request-RRB- for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The proper way is for the bridesmaids to walk together,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested
Fancy.

<p/>``What? <div class="bookquote">``Twas always young man and young woman, arm in crook, in my
time!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey, astounded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And in mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And in ours!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mrs.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. and Mrs. Penny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never heard o' such a thing as woman and woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div>said old William; who,
with grandfather James and Mrs. Day, was to stay at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whichever way you and the company like, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said Dick, who, being
on the point of securing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) right to Fancy, seemed willing to renounce
all other rights in the world with the greatest pleasure. The decision
was left to Fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think I'd rather have it the way mother had it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penny</b></font>) said, and
the couples moved along under the trees, every man to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) maid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said grandfather James to grandfather William as they retired, <div class="bookquote">``I
wonder which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thinks most about, Dick or her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wedding raiment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `tis their nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said grandfather William. ``Remember the words
of the prophet Jeremiah: <div class="bookquote">``Can a maid forget her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) ornaments, or a bride her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
attire?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Now among dark perpendicular firs, like the shafted columns of a
cathedral; now through a hazel copse, matted with primroses and wild
hyacinths; now under broad beeches in bright young leaves they threaded
their way into the high road over Yalbury Hill, which dipped at that
point directly into the village of Geoffrey Day's parish; and in the
space of a quarter of an hour Fancy found herself to be Mrs. Richard
Dewy, though, much to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) surprise, feeling no other than Fancy Day
still.

<p/>On the circuitous return walk through the lanes and fields, amid much
chattering and laughter, especially when they came to stiles, Dick

 (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER II: UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE


<p/>The point in Yalbury Wood which abutted on the end of Geoffrey Day's
premises was closed with an ancient tree, horizontally of enormous
extent, though having no great pretensions to height. Many hundreds of
birds had been born amidst the boughs of this single tree; tribes of
rabbits and hares had nibbled at its bark from year to year; quaint tufts
of fungi had sprung from the cavities of its forks; and countless
families of moles and earthworms had crept about its roots. Beneath and
beyond its shade spread a carefully-tended grass-plot, its purpose being
to supply a healthy exercise-ground for young chickens and pheasants; the
hens, their mothers, being enclosed in coops placed upon the same green
flooring.

<p/>All these encumbrances were now removed, and as the afternoon advanced,
the guests gathered on the spot, where music, dancing, and the singing of
songs went forward with great spirit throughout the evening. The
propriety of every one was intense by reason of the influence of Fancy,
who, as an additional precaution in this direction, had strictly charged
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) father and the tranter to carefully avoid saying `thee' and `thou' in
their conversation, on the plea that those ancient words sounded so very
humiliating to persons of newer taste; also that they were never to be
seen drawing the back of the hand across the mouth after drinking--a
local English custom of extraordinary antiquity, but stated by Fancy to
be decidedly dying out among the better classes of society.

<p/>In addition to the local musicians present, a man who had a thorough
knowledge of the tambourine was invited from the village of Tantrum
Clangley,--a place long celebrated for the skill of its inhabitants as
performers on instruments of percussion. These important members of the
assembly were relegated to a height of two or three feet from the ground,
upon a temporary erection of planks supported by barrels. Whilst the
dancing progressed the older persons sat in a group under the trunk of
the tree,--the space being allotted to them somewhat grudgingly by the
young ones, who were greedy of pirouetting room,--and fortified by a
table against the heels of the dancers. Here the gaffers and gammers,
whose dancing days were over, told stories of great impressiveness, and
at intervals surveyed the advancing and retiring couples from the same
retreat, as people on shore might be supposed to survey a naval
engagement in the bay beyond; returning again to their tales when the
pause was over. Those of the whirling throng, who, during the rests
between each figure, turned their eyes in the direction of these seated
ones, were only able to discover, on account of the music and bustle,
that a very striking circumstance was in course of narration--denoted by
an emphatic sweep of the hand, snapping of the fingers, close of the
lips, and fixed look into the centre of the listener's eye for the space
of a quarter of a minute, which raised in that listener such a
reciprocating working of face as to sometimes make the distant dancers
half wish to know what such an interesting tale could refer to.

<p/>Fancy caused her (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) looks to wear as much matronly expression as was
obtainable out of six hours' experience as a wife, in order that the
contrast between her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own state of life and that of the unmarried young
women present might be duly impressed upon the company: occasionally
stealing glances of admiration at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) left hand, but this quite
privately; for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ostensible bearing concerning the matter was intended
to show that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) undoubtedly occupied the most wondrous position
in the eyes of the world that had ever been attained, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was almost
unconscious of the circumstance, and that the somewhat prominent position
in which that wonderfully-emblazoned left hand was continually found to
be placed, when handing cups and saucers, knives, forks, and glasses, was
quite the result of accident. As to wishing to excite envy in the bosoms
of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) maiden companions, by the exhibition of the shining ring, every
one was to know it was quite foreign to the dignity of such an
experienced married woman. Dick's imagination in the meantime was far
less capable of drawing so much wontedness from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) new condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
had been for two or three hours trying to feel himself merely a newly-
married man, but had been able to get no further in the attempt than to
realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Dick Dewy, the tranter's son, at a party given by
Lord Wessex's head man-in-charge, on the outlying Yalbury estate, dancing
and chatting with Fancy Day.

<p/>Five country dances, including <div class="bookquote">``Haste to the Wedding,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>two reels, and
three fragments of horn-pipes, brought them to the time for supper,
which, on account of the dampness of the grass from the immaturity of the
summer season, was spread indoors. At the conclusion of the meal Dick
went out to put the horse in; and Fancy, with the elder half of the four
bridesmaids, retired upstairs to dress for the journey to Dick's new
cottage near Mellstock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long will you be putting on your bonnet, Fancy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>Dick inquired at
the foot of the staircase. Being now a man of business and married, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
was strong on the importance of time, and doubled the emphasis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)
words in conversing, and added vigour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) nods.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear, five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, sonnies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div>said the tranter, as Dick retired, <div class="bookquote">''`tis a talent of the
female race that low numbers should stand for high, more especially in
matters of waiting, matters of age, and matters of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dick/Dick Dewy/DICK</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, true, upon my body,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Day</b></font>)</div>said Geoffrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye spak with feeling, Geoffrey, seemingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anybody that d'know my experience might guess that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's she (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) doing now, Geoffrey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Claning out all the upstairs drawers and cupboards, and dusting the
second-best chainey--a thing that's only done once a year. ``If there's
work to be done I must do it,<div class="bookquote">'' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>), `wedding or no.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis my belief she (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>)'s a very good woman at bottom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)'s terrible deep, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penny turned round. <div class="bookquote">``Well, `tis humps and hollers with the best of
us; but still and for all that, Dick and Fancy stand as fair a chance of
having a bit of sunsheen as any married pair in the land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, there's no gainsaying it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dewy came up, talking to one person and looking at another. <div class="bookquote">``Happy,
yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis always so when a couple is so exactly in tune with
one another as Dick and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When they be'n't too poor to have time to sing,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said grandfather James.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell ye, neighbours, when the pinch comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter: <div class="bookquote">``when
the oldest daughter's boots be only a size less than her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother's, and
the rest o' the flock close behind her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). A sharp time for a man that, my
sonnies; a very sharp time! Chanticleer's comb is a-cut then, 'a
believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's about the form o`t,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Penny/Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Penny. <div class="bookquote">``That'll put the stuns upon
a man, when you must measure mother and daughter's lasts to tell 'em
apart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've no cause to complain, Reuben, of such a close-coming flock,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Dewy; <div class="bookquote">``for ours was a straggling lot enough, God knows!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I d'know it, I d'know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``You be a well-enough
woman, Ann.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dewy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dewy put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) mouth in the form of a smile, and put it back again
without smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if they come together, they go together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penny</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penny, whose
family had been the reverse of the tranter's; <div class="bookquote">``and a little money will
make either fate tolerable. And money can be made by our young couple, I
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that it can!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>said the impulsive voice of Leaf, who had hitherto
humbly admired the proceedings from a corner. <div class="bookquote">``It can be done--all
that's wanted is a few pounds to begin with. That's all! I know a story
about it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's hear thy story, Leaf,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``I never knew you were
clever enough to tell a story. Silence, all of ye! Mr. Leaf will tell a
story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell your story, Thomas Leaf,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said grandfather William in the tone of a
schoolmaster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Leaf</b></font>)</div>said the delighted Leaf, in an uncertain voice, ``there was a man
who lived in a house! Well, this man went thinking and thinking night
and day. At last, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself, as I might, ``If I had only ten
pound, I'd make a fortune.<div class="bookquote">'' At last by hook or by crook, behold he (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) got
the ten pounds!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only think of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nat Callcome/Nat</b></font>)</div>said Nat Callcome satirically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now comes the interesting part of the story! In a little time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
made that ten pounds twenty. Then a little time after that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doubled
it, and made it forty. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, and a good while after that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
made it eighty, and on to a hundred. Well, by-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made it two
hundred! Well, you'd never believe it, but--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on and made it four
hundred! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, and what did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made it eight hundred!
Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leaf</b></font>)</div>continued Leaf, in the highest pitch of excitement,
bringing down his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) fist upon his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) knee with such force that he (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) quivered
with the pain; <div class="bookquote">``yes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on and made it A THOUSAND!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the tranter. <div class="bookquote">``Better than the history of England, my
sonnies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for your story, Thomas Leaf,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said grandfather William; and
then Leaf gradually sank into nothingness again.

<p/>Amid a medley of laughter, old shoes, and elder-wine, Dick and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) bride
took their departure, side by side in the excellent new spring-cart which
the young tranter now possessed. The moon was just over the full,
rendering any light from lamps or their own beauties quite unnecessary to
the pair. They drove slowly along Yalbury Bottom, where the road passed
between two copses. Dick was talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``why we are so happy is because there is such full
confidence between us. Ever since that time you confessed to that little
flirtation with Shiner by the river -LRB-which was really no flirtation at
all-RRB-, I have thought how artless and good you must be to tell me o' such
a trifling thing, and to be so frightened about it as you were. It has
won me to tell you my every deed and word since then. We'll have no
secrets from each other, darling, will we ever?--no secret at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None from to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fancy. <div class="bookquote">``Hark! what's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>From a neighbouring thicket was suddenly heard to issue in a loud,
musical, and liquid voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tippiwit! swe-e-et! ki-ki-ki! Come hither, come hither, come hither!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, `tis the nightingale,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>murmured she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), and thought of a secret she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
would never tell.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<div class="bookquote">``Defects,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, -LRB-b-RRB- alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any

<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations. To donate, please visit:

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.net

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
