<p/>MANSFIELD PARK

<p/>-LRB-1814-RRB-


<p/>By Jane Austen




<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven
thousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of
Mansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised
to the rank of a baronet's lady, with all the comforts and consequences
of an handsome house and large income. All Huntingdon exclaimed on the
greatness of the match, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had two sisters to be benefited by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elevation; and such of their
acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome as
Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal
advantage. But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in
the world as there are pretty women to deserve them. Miss Ward, at the
end of half a dozen years, found herself obliged to be attached to
the Rev. Mr. Norris, a friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) brother-in-law, with scarcely any
private fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse. Miss Ward's match,
indeed, when it came to the point, was not contemptible: Sir Thomas
being happily able to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) friend an income in the living of
Mansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal
felicity with very little less than a thousand a year. But Miss Frances
married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) family, and by fixing on
a lieutenant of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions, did
it very thoroughly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) could hardly have made a more untoward choice.
Sir Thomas Bertram had interest, which, from principle as well as
pride--from a general wish of doing right, and a desire of seeing all
that were connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) in situations of respectability, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would
have been glad to exert for the advantage of Lady Bertram's sister; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) husband's profession was such as no interest could reach; and before
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had time to devise any other method of assisting them, an absolute
breach between the sisters had taken place. It was the natural result of
the conduct of each party, and such as a very imprudent marriage almost
always produces. To save herself from useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price
never wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) family on the subject till actually married. Lady
Bertram, who was a woman of very tranquil feelings, and a temper
remarkably easy and indolent, would have contented herself with merely
giving up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sister, and thinking no more of the matter; but Mrs.
Norris had a spirit of activity, which could not be satisfied till she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
had written a long and angry letter to Fanny, to point out the folly of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conduct, and threaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with all its possible ill consequences.
Mrs. Price, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) turn, was injured and angry; and an answer, which
comprehended each sister in its bitterness, and bestowed such very
disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norris
could not possibly keep to herself, put an end to all intercourse
between them for a considerable period.

<p/>Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so
distinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each
other's existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to
make it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have
it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) power to tell them, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) now and then did, in an angry
voice, that Fanny had got another child. By the end of eleven years,
however, Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or
resentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>).
A large and still increasing family, an husband disabled for active
service, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a very
small income to supply their wants, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) eager to regain the friends
she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had so carelessly sacrificed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) addressed Lady Bertram in
a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence, such a
superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything else, as
could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was preparing
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance, and
imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
could not conceal how important she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) felt they might be to the future
maintenance of the eight already in being. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) eldest was a boy of ten
years old, a fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world;
but what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) do? Was there any chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) being hereafter
useful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) West Indian property?
No situation would be beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); or what did Sir Thomas think of
Woolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to the East?

<p/>The letter was not unproductive. It re-established peace and kindness.
Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram dispatched
money and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.

<p/>Such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a more
important advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it. Mrs. Norris was
often observing to the others that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could not get her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) poor sister and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) family out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) head, and that, much as they had all done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could not but
own it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from the
charge and expense of one child entirely out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) great number. <div class="bookquote">``What
if they were among them to undertake the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) eldest daughter,
a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more attention than her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
poor mother could possibly give? The trouble and expense of it to them
would be nothing, compared with the benevolence of the action.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>Lady
Bertram agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) instantly. <div class="bookquote">``I think we cannot do better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``let us send for the child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
debated and hesitated;--it was a serious charge;--a girl so brought up
must be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty instead
of kindness in taking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own four
children, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;--but no sooner
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) deliberately begun to state his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) objections, than Mrs. Norris
interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the
generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a
piece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in
the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of
providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands;
and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my
mite upon such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I
look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the children
of my sisters?--and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just--but you know I am
a woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be frightened from
a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and introduce
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) properly into the world, and ten to one but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has the means of
settling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of ours, Sir
Thomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up in this
neighbourhood without many advantages. I don't say she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) would be so
handsome as her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) cousins. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) would not; but she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) would be
introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable
circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) a creditable
establishment. You are thinking of your sons--but do not you know that,
of all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, brought
up as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It is
morally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, the
only sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) a pretty
girl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence,
and I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) having been
suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect,
would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered boys in love
with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>). But breed her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) up with them from this time, and suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
even to have the beauty of an angel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) will never be more to
either than a sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a great deal of truth in what you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>replied Sir Thomas,
<div class="bookquote">``and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a
plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each.
I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in,
and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable to
ourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged to
secure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision of
a gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are so
sanguine in expecting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thoroughly understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Norris, <div class="bookquote">``you are everything
that is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagree
on this point. Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready
enough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I could never
feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your
own dear children, nor consider her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), in any respect, so much my own,
I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a
sister's child? and could I bear to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) want while I had a bit of
bread to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm
heart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of
life than do an ungenerous thing. So, if you are not against it, I will
write to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon
as matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield;
_you_ shall have no trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never
regard. I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>) may have a bed
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>) cousin the saddler's, and the child be appointed to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>)
there. They may easily get her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>) from Portsmouth to town by the coach,
under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going. I
dare say there is always some reputable tradesman's wife or other going
up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Except to the attack on Nanny's cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any
objection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous
being accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled,
and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed. The
division of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to
have been equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and
consistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the
least intention of being at any expense whatever in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) maintenance.
As far as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was thoroughly
benevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) love of money was equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) love of directing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) knew
quite as well how to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own as to spend that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) friends.
Having married on a narrower income than she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had been used to look
forward to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had, from the first, fancied a very strict line of
economy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon grew
into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitude which
there were no children to supply. Had there been a family to provide
for, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) money; but having no care
of that kind, there was nothing to impede her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) frugality, or lessen the
comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never
lived up to. Under this infatuating principle, counteracted by no real
affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sister, it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to aim at more than
the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity; though
perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) might so little know herself as to walk home to the
Parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief of being the
most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.

<p/>When the subject was brought forward again, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) views were more fully
explained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram's calm inquiry of <div class="bookquote">``Where shall
the child come to first, sister, to you or to us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>Sir Thomas heard with
some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris's power to
take any share in the personal charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had been considering
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as a desirable
companion to an aunt who had no children of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own; but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) found
himself wholly mistaken. Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the little
girl's staying with them, at least as things then were, was quite out of
the question. Poor Mr. Norris's indifferent state of health made it an
impossibility: he (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could no more bear the noise of a child than he (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could
fly; if, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) should ever get well of his (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) gouty complaints, it
would be a different matter: she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) should then be glad to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) turn,
and think nothing of the inconvenience; but just now, poor Mr. Norris
took up every moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) time, and the very mention of such a thing
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was sure would distract him (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had better come to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram, with the utmost
composure. After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, let
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) home be in this house. We will endeavour to do our duty by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own age, and
of a regular instructress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Norris, <div class="bookquote">``which are both very important
considerations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) has
three girls to teach, or only two--there can be no difference. I only
wish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I am not
one of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>),
however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away
for three days. I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the little
white attic, near the old nurseries. It will be much the best place
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>), so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and close by the
housemaids, who could either of them help to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>), you know, and
take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) clothes, for I suppose you would not think it fair to
expect Ellis to wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) as well as the others. Indeed, I do not see
that you could possibly place her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) anywhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Bertram made no opposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) will prove a well-disposed girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Norris,
<div class="bookquote">``and be sensible of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) uncommon good fortune in having such friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) disposition be really bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, <div class="bookquote">``we must not,
for our own children's sake, continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) in the family; but there is
no reason to expect so great an evil. We shall probably see much to wish
altered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>), and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, some
meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner; but
these are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) associates. Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, I should
have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very
serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to fear for
_them_, and everything to hope for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>)_, from the association.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Norris, <div class="bookquote">``and what I was
saying to my husband this morning. It will be an education for the
child, said I, only being with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) cousins; if Miss Lee taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>)
nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) would learn to be good and clever from _them_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) will not tease my poor pug,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram; <div class="bookquote">``I have but
just got Julia to leave it alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>observed Sir
Thomas, <div class="bookquote">``as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls
as they grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ the
consciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of
their cousin; and how, without depressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) spirits too far, to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) is not a _Miss Bertram_. I should wish to see them
very good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girls the
smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still they
cannot be equals. Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations will
always be different. It is a point of great delicacy, and you must
assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of
conduct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris was quite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) service; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) perfectly agreed
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to hope
that between them it would be easily managed.

<p/>It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sister
in vain. Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be
fixed on, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had so many fine boys, but accepted the offer most
thankfully, assuring them of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daughter's being a very well-disposed,
good-humoured girl, and trusting they would never have cause to throw
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) off. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) farther as somewhat delicate and puny, but was
sanguine in the hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being materially better for change of air.
Poor woman! she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) probably thought change of air might agree with many of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) children.



<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>The little girl performed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) long journey in safety; and at Northampton
was met by Mrs. Norris, who thus regaled in the credit of being foremost
to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), and in the importance of leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) in to the others,
and recommending her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to their kindness.

<p/>Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might
not be much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,
nothing to disgust her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) relations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was small of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) age, with no glow
of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid and shy,
and shrinking from notice; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) air, though awkward, was not vulgar,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) voice was sweet, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) countenance was pretty. Sir
Thomas and Lady Bertram received her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) very kindly; and Sir Thomas,
seeing how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) needed encouragement, tried to be all that was
conciliating: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had to work against a most untoward gravity of
deportment; and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or
speaking one word where he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) spoke ten, by the mere aid of a good-humoured
smile, became immediately the less awful character of the two.

<p/>The young people were all at home, and sustained their share in the
introduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, at
least on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tall
of their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little
cousin. The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in
greater awe of their father, who addressed them on the occasion with
rather an injudicious particularity. But they were too much used to
company and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their
confidence increasing from their cousin's total want of it, they were
soon able to take a full survey of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) face and her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) frock in easy
indifference.

<p/>They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, the
daughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward of
their age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousins
in person, as education had given to their address; and no one would
have supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were. There
were in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny. Julia
Bertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older. The little visitor
meanwhile was as unhappy as possible. Afraid of everybody, ashamed of
herself, and longing for the home she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had left, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew not how to look
up, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying. Mrs. Norris
had been talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) the whole way from Northampton of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) wonderful
good fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and good
behaviour which it ought to produce, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) consciousness of misery was
therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
not to be happy. The fatigue, too, of so long a journey, became soon no
trifling evil. In vain were the well-meant condescensions of Sir Thomas,
and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) would be
a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sit on the sofa
with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart
towards giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) comfort; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls
before tears interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), and sleep seeming to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) likeliest
friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was taken to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sorrows in bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not a very promising beginning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Norris, when Fanny
had left the room. <div class="bookquote">``After all that I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) as we came along, I
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would have behaved better; I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) how much might depend
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not be a
little sulkiness of temper--her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) poor mother had a good deal; but we must
make allowances for such a child--and I do not know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) being sorry
to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) home is really against her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), for, with all its faults,
it _was_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) cannot as yet understand how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) has
changed for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>It required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris was inclined to
allow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and the
separation from everybody she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been used to. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings were very
acute, and too little understood to be properly attended to. Nobody
meant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) comfort.

<p/>The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day, on purpose to
afford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining their young
cousin, produced little union. They could not but hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cheap on
finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had but two sashes, and had never learned French; and
when they perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be little struck with the duet they were so
good as to play, they could do no more than make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a generous present
of some of their least valued toys, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to herself, while
they adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport of the
moment, making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.

<p/>Fanny, whether near or from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins, whether in the schoolroom, the
drawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding something
to fear in every person and place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was disheartened by Lady
Bertram's silence, awed by Sir Thomas's grave looks, and quite overcome
by Mrs. Norris's admonitions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) elder cousins mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) by
reflections on her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) size, and abashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) by noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) shyness: Miss
Lee wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>)
clothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers
and sisters among whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) had always been important as playfellow,
instructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) little heart was
severe.

<p/>The grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>). The
rooms were too large for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) to move in with ease: whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) touched
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) expected to injure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) crept about in constant terror of
something or other; often retreating towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) own chamber to cry; and
the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left it
at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) peculiar good fortune,
ended every day's sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep. A week had
passed in this way, and no suspicion of it conveyed by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quiet
passive manner, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was found one morning by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin Edmund, the
youngest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear little cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), with all the gentleness of an
excellent nature, <div class="bookquote">``what can be the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And sitting down by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was at great pains to overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shame in being so surprised, and
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to speak openly. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ill? or was anybody angry with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? or had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) puzzled
about anything in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lesson that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could explain? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), in short,
want anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could possibly get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or do for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? For a long while
no answer could be obtained beyond a <div class="bookquote">``no, no--not at all--no, thank
you'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) still persevered; and no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) begun to revert
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own home, than her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) increased sobs explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) where the
grievance lay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) tried to console her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``which
shows you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you are
with relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make you
happy. Let us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all about your
brothers and sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On pursuing the subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) found that, dear as all these brothers and
sisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
thoughts than the rest. It was William whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) talked of most, and
wanted most to see. William, the eldest, a year older than herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
constant companion and friend; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) advocate with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother -LRB-of whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was the darling-RRB- in every distress. <div class="bookquote">``William did not like she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should
come away; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) should miss her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very much indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But
William will write to you, I dare say.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had promised he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had told _her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ to write first.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And when shall you do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hung her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and answered hesitatingly, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not
any paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with paper and every
other material, and you may write your letter whenever you choose. Would
it make you happy to write to William?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let it be done now. Come with me into the breakfast-room, we shall
find everything there, and be sure of having the room to ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, cousin, will it go to the post?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and,
as your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it to my father to
frank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further resistance; and
they went together into the breakfast-room, where Edmund prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
paper, and ruled her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lines with all the goodwill that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother
could himself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
continued with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the whole time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) writing, to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
penknife or his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) orthography, as either were wanted; and added to these
attentions, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt very much, a kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother which
delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) beyond all the rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wrote with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own hand his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
love to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cousin William, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) half a guinea under the seal.
Fanny's feelings on the occasion were such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed herself
incapable of expressing; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance and a few artless words
fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin began
to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) an interesting object. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) more, and, from all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, was convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) having an affectionate heart, and
a strong desire of doing right; and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could perceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be farther
entitled to attention by great sensibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) situation, and great
timidity. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had never knowingly given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pain, but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) now felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured,
in the first place, to lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fears of them all, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
especially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and
Julia, and being as merry as possible.

<p/>From this day Fanny grew more comfortable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had a
friend, and the kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Edmund gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) better spirits
with everybody else. The place became less strange, and the people less
formidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not cease
to fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began at least to know their ways, and to catch the best
manner of conforming to them. The little rusticities and awkwardnesses
which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all,
and not least of herself, necessarily wore away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was no longer
materially afraid to appear before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, nor did her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris's
voice make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) start very much. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) became occasionally
an acceptable companion. Though unworthy, from inferiority of age and
strength, to be their constant associate, their pleasures and schemes
were sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful, especially when
that third was of an obliging, yielding temper; and they could not but
own, when their aunt inquired into her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) faults, or their brother Edmund
urged her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) claims to their kindness, that <div class="bookquote">``Fanny was good-natured
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had nothing worse to endure
on the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of
seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was just
entering into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal
dispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only for expense and
enjoyment. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) kindness to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) little cousin was consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
situation and rights: he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) some very pretty presents, and laughed
at her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/>As her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris
thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it
was pretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
showed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them little
trouble. A mean opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) abilities was not confined to _them_.
Fanny could read, work, and write, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been taught nothing more;
and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins found her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ignorant of many things with which they had
been long familiar, they thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) prodigiously stupid, and for the
first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of
it into the drawing-room. <div class="bookquote">``Dear mama, only think, my cousin cannot
put the map of Europe together--or my cousin cannot tell the principal
rivers in Russia--or, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never heard of Asia Minor--or she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does
not know the difference between water-colours and crayons!--How
strange!--Did you ever hear anything so stupid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>their considerate aunt would reply, <div class="bookquote">``it is very bad, but
you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, aunt, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is really so very ignorant!--Do you know, we asked her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
last night which way she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would go to get to Ireland; and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
should cross to the Isle of Wight. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) thinks of nothing but the Isle of
Wight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) calls it _the_ _Island_, as if there were no other island
in the world. I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself, if I had
not known better long before I was so old as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is. I cannot remember
the time when I did not know a great deal that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has not the least
notion of yet. How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat the
chronological order of the kings of England, with the dates of their
accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added the other; <div class="bookquote">``and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus;
besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals,
semi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful
memories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is a
vast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else,
and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
deficiency. And remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever
yourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you know already,
there is a great deal more for you to learn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you another
thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not
want to learn either music or drawing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great
want of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I do not know
whether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know
-LRB-owing to me-RRB- your papa and mama are so good as to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) up with
you, it is not at all necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) should be as accomplished as
you are;--on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there should
be a difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nieces'
minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their promising
talents and early information, they should be entirely deficient in the
less common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity and humility. In
everything but disposition they were admirably taught. Sir Thomas did
not know what was wanting, because, though a truly anxious father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was not outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manner repressed
all the flow of their spirits before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>To the education of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest
attention. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had not time for such cares. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was a woman who spent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece of
needlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) pug than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put
herself to inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas,
and in smaller concerns by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sister. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) possessed greater leisure
for the service of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) girls, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would probably have supposed it
unnecessary, for they were under the care of a governess, with proper
masters, and could want nothing more. As for Fanny's being stupid at
learning, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) could only say it was very unlucky, but some people
_were_ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not know what
else was to be done; and, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being so dull, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must add she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw
no harm in the poor little thing, and always found her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very handy and
quick in carrying messages, and fetching what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at
Mansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) former home, grew up there not unhappily among her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
cousins. There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and though
Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought too
lowly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own claims to feel injured by it.

<p/>From about the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) entering the family, Lady Bertram, in
consequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gave
up the house in town, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been used to occupy every spring,
and remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
duty in Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfort
might arise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) absence. In the country, therefore, the Miss
Bertrams continued to exercise their memories, practise their duets,
and grow tall and womanly: and their father saw them becoming in person,
manner, and accomplishments, everything that could satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) anxiety.
His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eldest son was careless and extravagant, and had already given him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
much uneasiness; but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) other children promised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nothing but good.
His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughters, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt, while they retained the name of Bertram, must
be giving it new grace, and in quitting it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) trusted, would extend
its respectable alliances; and the character of Edmund, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) strong good
sense and uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for utility, honour, and
happiness to himself and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) connexions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was to be a clergyman.

<p/>Amid the cares and the complacency which his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own children suggested,
Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could for the children of Mrs.
Price: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) liberally in the education and disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny,
though almost totally separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) family, was sensible of the
truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them, or of
anything at all promising in their situation or conduct. Once, and once
only, in the course of many years, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the happiness of being with
William. Of the rest she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw nothing: nobody seemed to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ever
going amongst them again, even for a visit, nobody at home seemed to
want her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); but William determining, soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) removal, to be a
sailor, was invited to spend a week with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister in Northamptonshire
before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went to sea. Their eager affection in meeting, their exquisite
delight in being together, their hours of happy mirth, and moments of
serious conference, may be imagined; as well as the sanguine views and
spirits of the boy even to the last, and the misery of the girl when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas holidays, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
could directly look for comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin Edmund; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
such charming things of what William was to do, and be hereafter, in
consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) profession, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gradually admit that the
separation might have some use. Edmund's friendship never failed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>):
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) kind dispositions, and
only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them. Without any
display of doing more than the rest, or any fear of doing too much,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was always true to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) interests, and considerate of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feelings,
trying to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good qualities understood, and to conquer the
diffidence which prevented their being more apparent; giving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) advice,
consolation, and encouragement.

<p/>Kept back as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was by everybody else, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) single support could not
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forward; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attentions were otherwise of the highest
importance in assisting the improvement of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind, and extending its
pleasures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be clever, to have a quick apprehension
as well as good sense, and a fondness for reading, which, properly
directed, must be an education in itself. Miss Lee taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) French,
and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) read the daily portion of history; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) recommended
the books which charmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) leisure hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) taste, and
corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) judgment: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) made reading useful by talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) read, and heightened its attraction by judicious praise. In return
for such services she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) better than anybody in the world except
William: her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) heart was divided between the two.



<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>The first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr.
Norris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and necessarily
introduced alterations and novelties. Mrs. Norris, on quitting the
Parsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house
of Sir Thomas's in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
husband by considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could do very well without him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy.

<p/>The living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) uncle died a few years
sooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
were old enough for orders. But Tom's extravagance had, previous to
that event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the next
presentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for the
pleasures of the elder. There was another family living actually held
for Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement
somewhat easier to Sir Thomas's conscience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not but feel it to
be an act of injustice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) earnestly tried to impress his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eldest son
with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better effect
than anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had yet been able to say or do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I blush for you, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) most dignified manner; <div class="bookquote">``I blush
for the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity your
feelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten,
twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income
which ought to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours
-LRB-I hope it will-RRB-, to procure him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) better preferment; but it must not
be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
natural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent
for the certain advantage which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is now obliged to forego through the
urgency of your debts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow; but escaping as quickly as
possible, could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had not been half so much in debt as some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friends; secondly, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it; and,
thirdly, that the future incumbent, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might be, would, in all
probability, die very soon.

<p/>On Mr. Norris's death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant,
who came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be a
hearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram's
calculations. But <div class="bookquote">``no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of fellow,
and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had a wife about fifteen years his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) junior, but no children; and
they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very
respectable, agreeable people.

<p/>The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sister-in-law to
claim her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris's situation,
and the improvement in Fanny's age, seeming not merely to do away any
former objection to their living together, but even to give it the most
decided eligibility; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own circumstances were rendered less
fair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) West India estate, in
addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eldest son's extravagance, it became not undesirable
to himself to be relieved from the expense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) support, and the
obligation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) future provision. In the fullness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) belief that
such a thing must be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mentioned its probability to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife; and the
first time of the subject's occurring to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again happening to be when
Fanny was present, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) calmly observed to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``So, Fanny, you are going
to leave us, and live with my sister. How shall you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's words,
<div class="bookquote">``Going to leave you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear; why should you be astonished? You have been five years
with us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died.
But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
never received kindness from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris, and could not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very sorry to go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), with a faltering voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I dare say you will; _that's_ natural enough. I suppose you have
had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature
in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny modestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear; I hope not. I have always found you a very good girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I never to live here again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. It can make
very little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not feel the
difference to be so small, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not think of living with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
with anything like satisfaction. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) met with Edmund she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) distress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``something is going to happen which I do not like
at all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to
things that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now. I am
going to live entirely with my aunt Norris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so. It is quite settled. I am to
leave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is removed there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should call
it an excellent one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, cousin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a sensible
woman in wishing for you. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is choosing a friend and companion exactly
where she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ought, and I am glad her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) love of money does not interfere.
You will be what you ought to be to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). I hope it does not distress you
very much, Fanny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything in
it: I shall love nothing there. You know how uncomfortable I feel with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can say nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) manner to you as a child; but it was the
same with us all, or nearly so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never knew how to be pleasant to
children. But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is
behaving better already; and when you are her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only companion, you _must_
be important to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never be important to any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to prevent you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, you
never have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly.
There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where
you are known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure
you have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without
wishing to return it. I do not know any better qualifications for a
friend and companion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, colouring at such praise; <div class="bookquote">``how shall I
ever thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me. Oh! cousin, if I
am to go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distance
as the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred miles
off instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost
as much as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in the
year. The only difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will
necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be. _Here_ there are
too many whom you can hide behind; but with _her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)_ you will be forced to
speak for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I do not say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say it, and say it with pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much better
fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) is of a
temper to do a great deal for anybody she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) really interests herself
about, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) will force you to do justice to your natural powers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny sighed, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot see things as you do; but I ought to
believe you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obliged
to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be. If I could suppose
my aunt really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself of
consequence to anybody. _Here_, I know, I am of none, and yet I love the
place so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the house.
You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever. Even
_your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal
change. You will have the same walks to frequent, the same library to
choose from, the same people to look at, the same horse to ride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true. Yes, dear old grey pony! Ah! cousin, when I remember how
much I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talked
of as likely to do me good -LRB-oh! how I have trembled at my uncle's
opening his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lips if horses were talked of-RRB-, and then think of the kind
pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince
me that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right you
proved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as
good for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for
your ultimate happiness too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>So ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it
could render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had
not the smallest intention of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). It had never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>),
on the present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. To
prevent its being expected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had fixed on the smallest habitation
which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish,
the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
servants, and allow a spare room for a friend, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) made a
very particular point. The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been
wanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now
never forgotten. Not all her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) precautions, however, could save her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) from
being suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) very display of
the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose
it really intended for Fanny. Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a
certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goes
to live with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris almost started. <div class="bookquote">``Live with me, dear Lady Bertram! what do
you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) not to live with you? I thought you had settled it with Sir
Thomas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! never. I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to
me. Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think
of, or for anybody to wish that really knows us both. Good heaven! what
could I do with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for
anything, my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl at
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) time of life? A girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to need
most attention and care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test!
Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing! Sir Thomas is
too much my friend. Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure, would propose
it. How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I do not know. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought it best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) say? He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not say he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) _wished_ me to take Fanny. I
am sure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not wish me to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) only said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought it very likely; and I thought so too. We
both thought it would be a comfort to you. But if you do not like it,
there is no more to be said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is no encumbrance here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) be any
comfort to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best of
husbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), my spirits still
worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to
support me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as not
to disgrace the memory of the dear departed--what possible comfort could
I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny? If I could wish it for
my own sake, I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
is in good hands, and sure of doing well. I must struggle through my
sorrows and difficulties as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Bertram, I do not complain. I know I cannot live as I have done,
but I must retrench where I can, and learn to be a better manager. I
_have_ _been_ a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed
to practise economy now. My situation is as much altered as my income.
A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the
parish, that cannot be expected from me. It is unknown how much was
consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At the White House,
matters must be better looked after. I _must_ live within my income, or
I shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to
be able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you will. You always do, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me.
It is for your children's good that I wish to be richer. I have nobody
else to care for, but I should be very glad to think I could leave a
little trifle among them worth their having.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them. They are
sure of being well provided for. Sir Thomas will take care of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you know, Sir Thomas's means will be rather straitened if the
Antigua estate is to make such poor returns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! _that_ will soon be settled. Sir Thomas has been writing about it,
I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Lady Bertram,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, <div class="bookquote">``I can only say
that my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir
Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able
to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;
besides that, I really should not have a bed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), for I must
keep a spare room for a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) husband to
convince him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) how much he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had mistaken his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sister-in-law's views; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the
slightest allusion to it from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not but wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
refusing to do anything for a niece whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had been so forward to
adopt; but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) took early care to make him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as well as Lady Bertram,
understand that whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) possessed was designed for their family,
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) soon grew reconciled to a distinction which, at the same time that it
was advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) better to
provide for Fanny himself.

<p/>Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fears of a removal;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some
consolation to Edmund for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) disappointment in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had expected to
be so essentially serviceable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Mrs. Norris took possession of the
White House, the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events over,
everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.

<p/>The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable, gave great
satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance. They had their
faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out. The Doctor was very fond of
eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant, instead
of contriving to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) at little expense, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) cook as high
wages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
offices. Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances,
nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed
in the house. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself;
nobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed, had never
been wanting in comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad character
in _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ _time_, but this was a way of going on that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not
understand. A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place.
_Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)_ store-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought, might have been good enough for Mrs.
Grant to go into. Inquire where she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not find out that
Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) felt all
the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant's being so well settled in life
without being handsome, and expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) astonishment on that point
almost as often, though not so diffusely, as Mrs. Norris discussed the
other.

<p/>These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event
arose of such importance in the family, as might fairly claim some place
in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies. Sir Thomas found it
expedient to go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
affairs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eldest son with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), in the hope of detaching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) from some bad connexions at home. They left England with the
probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent.

<p/>The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of its
utility to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the
rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, and of leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters to the direction of
others at their present most interesting time of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not
think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) place with them, or rather,
to perform what should have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own; but, in Mrs. Norris's watchful
attention, and in Edmund's judgment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had sufficient confidence to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) go without fears for their conduct.

<p/>Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) husband leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
was not disturbed by any alarm for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) safety, or solicitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
comfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous,
or difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.

<p/>The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion: not for their
sorrow, but for their want of it. Their father was no object of love to
them; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) absence
was unhappily most welcome. They were relieved by it from all restraint;
and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been
forbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at their
own disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach. Fanny's
relief, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) consciousness of it, were quite equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins';
but a more tender nature suggested that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings were ungrateful,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) really grieved because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not grieve. <div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas, who
had done so much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) brothers, and who was gone perhaps
never to return! that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) go without a tear! it was a
shameful insensibility.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), moreover, on the very last
morning, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might see William again in the course of the
ensuing winter, and had charged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to write and invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to Mansfield
as soon as the squadron to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) belonged should be known to be
in England. <div class="bookquote">``This was so thoughtful and kind!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and would he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) only have
smiled upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and called her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``my dear Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>while he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) said it, every
former frown or cold address might have been forgotten. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had ended
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) speech in a way to sink her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in sad mortification, by adding, <div class="bookquote">``If
William does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been
spent on your side entirely without improvement; though, I fear, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must
find his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister at
ten.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried bitterly over this reflection when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle was
gone; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins, on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with red eyes, set her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) down as a
hypocrite.



<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>Tom Bertram had of late spent so little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) time at home that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
could be only nominally missed; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished
to find how very well they did even without his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) father, how well Edmund
could supply his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) place in carving, talking to the steward, writing to
the attorney, settling with the servants, and equally saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
from all possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of
directing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) letters.

<p/>The earliest intelligence of the travellers' safe arrival at Antigua,
after a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris
had been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund
participate them whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could get him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) alone; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) depended
on being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,
when Sir Thomas's assurances of their both being alive and well made it
necessary to lay by her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches
for a while.

<p/>The winter came and passed without their being called for; the accounts
continued perfectly good; and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
nieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments,
and looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, in
addition to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own household cares, some interference in those of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sister, and Mrs. Grant's wasteful doings to overlook, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) very
little occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.

<p/>The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the
neighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements
a manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to general civility and
obligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration. Their
vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it,
and gave themselves no airs; while the praises attending such behaviour,
secured and brought round by their aunt, served to strengthen them in
believing they had no faults.

<p/>Lady Bertram did not go into public with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) daughters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was too
indolent even to accept a mother's gratification in witnessing their
success and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble, and the
charge was made over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sister, who desired nothing better than a
post of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly relished
the means it afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) of mixing in society without having horses to
hire.

<p/>Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) enjoyed
being avowedly useful as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's companion when they called away the
rest of the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) naturally
became everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); and the tranquillity
of such evenings, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) perfect security in such a _tete-a-tete_ from any
sound of unkindness, was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom
known a pause in its alarms or embarrassments. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) cousins'
gaieties, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) loved to hear an account of them, especially of the
balls, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thought too lowly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
own situation to imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) should ever be admitted to the same, and
listened, therefore, without an idea of any nearer concern in them. Upon
the whole, it was a comfortable winter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); for though it brought
no William to England, the never-failing hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) arrival was worth
much.

<p/>The ensuing spring deprived her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) valued friend, the old grey pony;
and for some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was in danger of feeling the loss in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) health as
well as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) affections; for in spite of the acknowledged importance
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) riding on horse-back, no measures were taken for mounting her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
again, <div class="bookquote">``because,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as it was observed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) aunts, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might ride one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cousin's horses at any time when they did not want them,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunts</b></font>)</div>and as
the Miss Bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day, and had
no idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real
pleasure, that time, of course, never came. They took their cheerful
rides in the fine mornings of April and May; and Fanny either sat at
home the whole day with one aunt, or walked beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) strength at
the instigation of the other: Lady Bertram holding exercise to be as
unnecessary for everybody as it was unpleasant to herself; and Mrs.
Norris, who was walking all day, thinking everybody ought to walk
as much. Edmund was absent at this time, or the evil would have
been earlier remedied. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) returned, to understand how Fanny was
situated, and perceived its ill effects, there seemed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) but one
thing to be done; and that <div class="bookquote">``Fanny must have a horse''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was the resolute
declaration with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) opposed whatever could be urged by the
supineness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother, or the economy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) aunt, to make it appear
unimportant. Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some steady old
thing might be found among the numbers belonging to the Park that would
do vastly well; or that one might be borrowed of the steward; or that
perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then lend them the pony he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sent to the
post. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary, and even
improper, that Fanny should have a regular lady's horse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own, in
the style of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was sure Sir Thomas had never intended it:
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must say that, to be making such a purchase in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) absence, and
adding to the great expenses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stable, at a time when a large part
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) income was unsettled, seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very unjustifiable. <div class="bookquote">``Fanny
must have a horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>was Edmund's only reply. Mrs. Norris could not see
it in the same light. Lady Bertram did: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) entirely agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) son
as to the necessity of it, and as to its being considered necessary by
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) only pleaded against there being any hurry; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) only
wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to wait till Sir Thomas's return, and then Sir Thomas might
settle it all himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would be at home in September, and where would
be the harm of only waiting till September?

<p/>Though Edmund was much more displeased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) aunt than with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mother, as evincing least regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) niece, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not help paying
more attention to what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said; and at length determined on a method of
proceeding which would obviate the risk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father's thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
had done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny the immediate
means of exercise, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not bear she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be without. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
three horses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own, but not one that would carry a woman. Two
of them were hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this third he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
resolved to exchange for one that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) cousin might ride; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) knew where
such a one was to be met with; and having once made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind, the
whole business was soon completed. The new mare proved a treasure; with
a very little trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) became exactly calculated for the purpose,
and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not
supposed before that anything could ever suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) like the old grey
pony; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) delight in Edmund's mare was far beyond any former
pleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving in the
consideration of that kindness from which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pleasure sprung, was
beyond all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) words to express. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin as an example
of everything good and great, as possessing worth which no one but
herself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as no feelings could be strong enough to pay. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sentiments towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) were compounded of all that was respectful, grateful, confiding, and
tender.

<p/>As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of Edmund,
Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny's use; and had Lady
Bertram ever thought about her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own objection again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) might have
been excused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas's return in
September, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and
without any near prospect of finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) business. Unfavourable
circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was beginning to
turn all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thoughts towards England; and the very great uncertainty
in which everything was then involved determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) on sending home his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
son, and waiting the final arrangement by himself. Tom arrived safely,
bringing an excellent account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's health; but to very little
purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned. Sir Thomas's sending away
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) so like a parent's care, under the influence of a
foreboding of evil to himself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could not help feeling dreadful
presentiments; and as the long evenings of autumn came on, was so
terribly haunted by these ideas, in the sad solitariness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) cottage,
as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-room of the Park.
The return of winter engagements, however, was not without its effect;
and in the course of their progress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) mind became so pleasantly
occupied in superintending the fortunes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) eldest niece, as
tolerably to quiet her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nerves. <div class="bookquote">``If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to
return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well
married,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) very often thought; always when they were in the company
of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a young man
who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest
places in the country.

<p/>Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram,
and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was
a heavy young man, with not more than common sense; but as there was
nothing disagreeable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) figure or address, the young lady was well
pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) conquest. Being now in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) twenty-first year, Maria
Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a marriage with
Mr. Rushworth would give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the enjoyment of a larger income than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
father's, as well as ensure her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the house in town, which was now a prime
object, it became, by the same rule of moral obligation, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) evident
duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could. Mrs. Norris was most zealous
in promoting the match, by every suggestion and contrivance likely to
enhance its desirableness to either party; and, among other means, by
seeking an intimacy with the gentleman's mother, who at present lived
with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) even forced Lady Bertram to go through ten
miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit. It was not long before
a good understanding took place between this lady and herself. Mrs.
Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) son should marry,
and declared that of all the young ladies she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had ever seen, Miss
Bertram seemed, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) amiable qualities and accomplishments, the best
adapted to make him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) happy. Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment,
and admired the nice discernment of character which could so well
distinguish merit. Maria was indeed the pride and delight of them
all--perfectly faultless--an angel; and, of course, so surrounded by
admirers, must be difficult in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) choice: but yet, as far as Mrs.
Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance, Mr.
Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>).

<p/>After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young
people justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due reference
to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfaction
of their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of the
neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency of Mr.
Rushworth's marrying Miss Bertram.

<p/>It was some months before Sir Thomas's consent could be received; but,
in the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) most cordial pleasure
in the connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried
on without restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs.
Norris's talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at
present.

<p/>Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the
business; but no representation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) aunt's could induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to find
Mr. Rushworth a desirable companion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) could allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) sister to be
the best judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own happiness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was not pleased that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
happiness should centre in a large income; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) refrain from
often saying to himself, in Mr. Rushworth's company--<div class="bookquote">``If this man had
not twelve thousand a year, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be a very stupid fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance
so unquestionably advantageous, and of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) heard nothing but the
perfectly good and agreeable. It was a connexion exactly of the right
sort--in the same county, and the same interest--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) most hearty
concurrence was conveyed as soon as possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) only conditioned that
the marriage should not take place before his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) return, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was again
looking eagerly forward to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wrote in April, and had strong hopes
of settling everything to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) entire satisfaction, and leaving Antigua
before the end of the summer.

<p/>Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eighteenth year, when the society of the village received
an addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss
Crawford, the children of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mother by a second marriage. They were
young people of fortune. The son had a good estate in Norfolk, the
daughter twenty thousand pounds. As children, their sister had been
always very fond of them; but, as her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own marriage had been soon
followed by the death of their common parent, which left them to the
care of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
had scarcely seen them since. In their uncle's house they had found a
kind home. Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else,
were united in affection for these children, or, at least, were no
farther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite, to
whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two. The Admiral delighted
in the boy, Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl; and it was the lady's death
which now obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) _protegee_, after some months' further trial at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle's house, to find another home. Admiral Crawford was a man of
vicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaining his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) niece, to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mistress under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own roof; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
sister's proposal of coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), a measure quite as welcome on one
side as it could be expedient on the other; for Mrs. Grant, having by
this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the
country without a family of children--having more than filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
favourite sitting-room with pretty furniture, and made a choice
collection of plants and poultry--was very much in want of some variety
at home. The arrival, therefore, of a sister whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had always loved,
and now hoped to retain with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) remained single, was
highly agreeable; and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should not
satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to London.

<p/>Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions, though
they arose principally from doubts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister's style of living and
tone of society; and it was not till after she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had tried in vain to
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother to settle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own country house,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could resolve to hazard herself among her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) other relations. To
anything like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, Henry
Crawford had, unluckily, a great dislike: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not accommodate his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
sister in an article of such importance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), with the
utmost kindness, into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetch
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) away again, at half an hour's notice, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were weary of the
place.

<p/>The meeting was very satisfactory on each side. Miss Crawford found a
sister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister's husband who looked
the gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grant
received in those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) hoped to love better than ever a young man
and woman of very prepossessing appearance. Mary Crawford was remarkably
pretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance; the manners
of both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them
credit for everything else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was delighted with each, but Mary was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dearest object; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister's.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not waited her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arrival to look out for a suitable match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>):
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest son of a baronet was not too
good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds, with all the elegance
and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>); and being a
warm-hearted, unreserved woman, Mary had not been three hours in the
house before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had planned.

<p/>Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near
them, and not at all displeased either at her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister's early care, or
the choice it had fallen on. Matrimony was her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) object, provided she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
could marry well: and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) knew that
objection could no more be made to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) person than to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) situation in
life. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) treated it as a joke, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not forget to
think of it seriously. The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Grant, <div class="bookquote">``I have thought of something to make it
complete. I should dearly love to settle you both in this country; and
therefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice,
handsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very
happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry bowed and thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``if you can persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) into anything
of the sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself
allied to anybody so clever, and I shall only regret that you have
not half a dozen daughters to dispose of. If you can persuade Henry
to marry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman. All that English
abilities can do has been tried already. I have three very particular
friends who have been all dying for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in their turn; and the pains
which they, their mothers -LRB-very clever women-RRB-, as well as my dear aunt
and myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) into marrying, is
inconceivable! He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined. If
your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke, let them
avoid Henry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear brother, I will not believe this of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, I am sure you are too good. You will be kinder than Mary. You
will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience. I am of a cautious
temper, and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry. Nobody can
think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself. I consider the
blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of
the poet--`Heaven's _last_ best gift.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, Mrs. Grant, you see how he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) dwells on one word, and only look
at his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) smile. I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) is very detestable; the Admiral's lessons
have quite spoiled him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I pay very little regard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Grant, <div class="bookquote">``to what any young person
says on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination for
it, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no
disinclination to the state herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! I am not at all ashamed of it. I would have everybody marry if
they can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselves
away; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to
advantage.''



 (<font color='red'><b>The people</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>The young people were pleased with each other from the first. On each
side there was much to attract, and their acquaintance soon promised as
early an intimacy as good manners would warrant. Miss Crawford's beauty
did her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) no disservice with the Miss Bertrams. They were too handsome
themselves to dislike any woman for being so too, and were almost as
much charmed as their brothers with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lively dark eye, clear brown
complexion, and general prettiness. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) been tall, full formed, and
fair, it might have been more of a trial: but as it was, there could be
no comparison; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was most allowably a sweet, pretty girl, while
they were the finest young women in the country.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother was not handsome: no, when they first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
absolutely plain, black and plain; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was the gentleman, with
a pleasing address. The second meeting proved him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not so very plain:
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was plain, to be sure, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had so much countenance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
teeth were so good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was so well made, that one soon forgot he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
plain; and after a third interview, after dining in company with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at
the Parsonage, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was, in fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known,
and they were equally delighted with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Miss Bertram's engagement made
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in equity the property of Julia, of which Julia was fully aware; and
before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been at Mansfield a week, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was quite ready to be fallen
in love with.

<p/>Maria's notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
did not want to see or understand. <div class="bookquote">``There could be no harm in her (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) liking
an agreeable man--everybody knew her (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) situation--Mr. Crawford must take
care of himself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger! the
Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready to be pleased; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
began with no object but of making them like him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not want them
to die of love; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
judge and feel better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) allowed himself great latitude on such points.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) returned
from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit; <div class="bookquote">``they
are very elegant, agreeable girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it. But you like
Julia best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! I like Julia best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the
handsomest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I should suppose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) has the advantage in every feature, and I
prefer her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) countenance; but I like Julia best; Miss Bertram is certainly
the handsomest, and I have found her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) the most agreeable, but I shall
always like Julia best, because you order me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you _will_ like her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) best at
last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not I tell you that I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) best _at_ _first_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And besides, Miss Bertram is engaged. Remember that, my dear brother.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) choice is made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) the better for it. An engaged woman is always more
agreeable than a disengaged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) is satisfied with herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) cares
are over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) feels that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) may exert all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) powers of pleasing
without suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and it
is a great match for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>); _that_ is your
opinion of your intimate friend. _I_ do not subscribe to it. I am sure
Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth. I could see it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) eyes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was mentioned. I think too well of Miss Bertram to
suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would ever give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) hand without her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, how shall we manage him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) to himself, I believe. Talking does no good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) will
be taken in at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) _taken_ _in_; I would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) duped; I
would have it all fair and honourable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear! let him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) stand his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) chance and be taken in. It will do just as
well. Everybody is taken in at some period or other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always in marriage, dear Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In marriage especially. With all due respect to such of the present
company as chance to be married, my dear Mrs. Grant, there is not one in
a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry. Look where
I will, I see that it _is_ so; and I feel that it _must_ be so, when I
consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people expect
most from others, and are least honest themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but,
however, speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring business.
I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence
of some one particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, or
good quality in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived,
and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse. What is this but a
take in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, there must be a little imagination here. I beg your
pardon, but I cannot quite believe you. Depend upon it, you see but
half. You see the evil, but you do not see the consolation. There will
be little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to
expect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human
nature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make
a second better: we find comfort somewhere--and those evil-minded
observers, dearest Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken in
and deceived than the parties themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, sister! I honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_. When I am a
wife, I mean to be just as staunch myself; and I wish my friends in
general would be so too. It would save me many a heartache.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure you both.
Mansfield shall cure you both, and without any taking in. Stay with us,
and we will cure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Crawfords</b></font>)</div><p/>The Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very willing to stay.
Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home, and Henry
equally ready to lengthen his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) visit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had come, intending to spend
only a few days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there was
nothing to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) elsewhere. It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so: a
talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society
to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford's being his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) guest was
an excuse for drinking claret every day.

<p/>The Miss Bertrams' admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than
anything which Miss Crawford's habits made her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) likely to feel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
acknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men,
that two such young men were not often seen together even in London, and
that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good.
_He (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>)_ had been much in London, and had more liveliness and gallantry than
Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) being the
eldest was another strong claim. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had felt an early presentiment that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) _should_ like the eldest best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) knew it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) way.

<p/>Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was
the sort of young man to be generally liked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) agreeableness was of
the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher
stamp, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance,
and a great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield Park, and a
baronetcy, did no harm to all this. Miss Crawford soon felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) situation might do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with due consideration, and
found almost everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) favour: a park, a real park, five miles
round, a spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well screened
as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen's
seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be completely new
furnished--pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an agreeable man
himself--with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present
by a promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, and of being Sir Thomas hereafter. It
might do very well; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began
accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had to
run at the B-- races.

<p/>These races were to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) away not long after their acquaintance
began; and as it appeared that the family did not, from his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) usual goings
on, expect him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) back again for many weeks, it would bring his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) passion to
an early proof. Much was said on his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) side to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to attend the
races, and schemes were made for a large party to them, with all the
eagerness of inclination, but it would only do to be talked of.

<p/>And Fanny, what was _she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ doing and thinking all this while? and what
was _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ opinion of the newcomers? Few young ladies of eighteen could
be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny. In a quiet way,
very little attended to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tribute of admiration to Miss
Crawford's beauty; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) still continued to think Mr. Crawford
very plain, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) two cousins having repeatedly proved the
contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never mentioned _him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_. The notice, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) excited
herself, was to this effect. <div class="bookquote">``I begin now to understand you all,
except Miss Price,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was walking with the Mr.
Bertrams. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) out, or is she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) not? I am puzzled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) dined at
the Parsonage, with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_; and
yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) says so little, that I can hardly suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) _is_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, <div class="bookquote">``I believe I know
what you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question. My
cousin is grown up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs
and not outs are beyond me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. The
distinction is so broad. Manners as well as appearance are, generally
speaking, so totally different. Till now, I could not have supposed it
possible to be mistaken as to a girl's being out or not. A girl not out
has always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks
very demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I
assure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far,
it is all very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most
objectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being
introduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass in
such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite--to confidence!
_That_ is the faulty part of the present system. One does not like to
see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing--and
perhaps when one has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hardly able to speak the year before. Mr.
Bertram, I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with such changes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you are at. You
are quizzing me and Miss Anderson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. Miss Anderson! I do not know who or what you mean. I am
quite in the dark. But I _will_ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure,
if you will tell me what about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite so far imposed
on. You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye, in describing an
altered young lady. You paint too accurately for mistake. It was exactly
so. The Andersons of Baker Street. We were speaking of them the other
day, you know. Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles Anderson.
The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it. When
Anderson first introduced me to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) family, about two years ago, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>)
sister was not _out_, and I could not get her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to speak to me. I sat
there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson, with only her (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) and a
little girl or two in the room, the governess being sick or run away,
and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business, and I
could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady--nothing like a
civil answer--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) screwed up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mouth, and turned from me with such an
air! I did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again for a twelvemonth. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was then _out_. I
met her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at Mrs. Holford's, and did not recollect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came up to me,
claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and talked
and laughed till I did not know which way to look. I felt that I must
be the jest of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is plain, has
heard the story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, I dare say,
than does credit to Miss Anderson. It is too common a fault. Mothers
certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their
daughters. I do not know where the error lies. I do not pretend to set
people right, but I do see that they are often wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those who are showing the world what female manners _should_ be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Bertram gallantly, <div class="bookquote">``are doing a great deal to set them right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The error is plain enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said the less courteous Edmund; <div class="bookquote">``such girls
are ill brought up. They are given wrong notions from the beginning.
They are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no more
real modesty in their behaviour _before_ they appear in public than
afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I cannot
agree with you there. It is certainly the modestest part of the
business. It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the
same airs and take the same liberties as if they were, which I have seen
done. That is worse than anything--quite disgusting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, _that_ is very inconvenient indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bertram. <div class="bookquote">``It leads
one astray; one does not know what to do. The close bonnet and demure
air you describe so well -LRB-and nothing was ever juster-RRB-, tell one what
is expected; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of
them. I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September,
just after my return from the West Indies. My friend Sneyd--you have
heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund--his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father, and mother, and sisters,
were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place they were out;
we went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and the two Miss
Sneyds, with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow in form; and
as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
daughters, walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) side all the way home, and made myself as
agreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manners, and
as ready to talk as to listen. I had not a suspicion that I could be
doing anything wrong. They looked just the same: both well-dressed, with
veils and parasols like other girls; but I afterwards found that I had
been giving all my attention to the youngest, who was not _out_, and
had most excessively offended the eldest. Miss Augusta ought not to have
been noticed for the next six months; and Miss Sneyd, I believe, has
never forgiven me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was bad indeed. Poor Miss Sneyd. Though I have no younger
sister, I feel for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). To be neglected before one's time must be very
vexatious; but it was entirely the mother's fault. Miss Augusta should
have been with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) governess. Such half-and-half doings never prosper.
But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price. Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) go to balls? Does
she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) dine out every where, as well as at my sister's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>replied Edmund; <div class="bookquote">``I do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) has ever been to a ball. My
mother seldom goes into company herself, and dines nowhere but with Mrs.
Grant, and Fanny stays at home with _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! then the point is clear. Miss Price is not out.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>Mr. Bertram set off for--------, and Miss Crawford was prepared to
find a great chasm in their society, and to miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) decidedly in the
meetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families;
and on their all dining together at the Park soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) going, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
retook her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) chosen place near the bottom of the table, fully expecting to
feel a most melancholy difference in the change of masters. It would
be a very flat business, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was sure. In comparison with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) brother,
Edmund would have nothing to say. The soup would be sent round in a most
spiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling,
and the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any
former haunch, or a single entertaining story, about <div class="bookquote">``my friend such a
one.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper
end of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth, who was now making his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords' arrival.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county, and that
friend having recently had his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) grounds laid out by an improver, Mr.
Rushworth was returned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) head full of the subject, and very eager
to be improving his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own place in the same way; and though not saying
much to the purpose, could talk of nothing else. The subject had
been already handled in the drawing-room; it was revived in the
dining-parlour. Miss Bertram's attention and opinion was evidently his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
chief aim; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) deportment showed rather conscious superiority
than any solicitude to oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), the mention of Sotherton Court,
and the ideas attached to it, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) a feeling of complacency, which
prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) from being very ungracious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you could see Compton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it is the most complete thing!
I never saw a place so altered in my life. I told Smith I did not know
where I was. The approach _now_, is one of the finest things in the
country: you see the house in the most surprising manner. I declare,
when I got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a prison--quite a
dismal old prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Norris. <div class="bookquote">``A prison indeed? Sotherton Court is
the noblest old place in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wants improvement, ma’am, beyond anything. I never saw a place that
wanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I do
not know what can be done with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Grant to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; <div class="bookquote">``but depend upon it, Sotherton will
have _every_ improvement in time which his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) heart can desire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must try to do something with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Rushworth, <div class="bookquote">``but I do not
know what. I hope I shall have some good friend to help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your best friend upon such an occasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bertram calmly,
<div class="bookquote">``would be Mr. Repton, I imagine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I was thinking of. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Repton</b></font>) has done so well by Smith, I
think I had better have him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) at once. His (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) terms are five guineas a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and if they were _ten_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Norris, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure _you_ need
not regard it. The expense need not be any impediment. If I were you,
I should not think of the expense. I would have everything done in the
best style, and made as nice as possible. Such a place as Sotherton
Court deserves everything that taste and money can do. You have space to
work upon there, and grounds that will well reward you. For my own part,
if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton, I
should be always planting and improving, for naturally I am excessively
fond of it. It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where
I am now, with my little half acre. It would be quite a burlesque. But
if I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight in improving and
planting. We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage: we made it
quite a different place from what it was when we first had it. You young
ones do not remember much about it, perhaps; but if dear Sir Thomas were
here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could tell you what improvements we made: and a great deal more
would have been done, but for poor Mr. Norris's sad state of health.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could hardly ever get out, poor man, to enjoy anything, and _that_
disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to
talk of. If it had not been for _that_, we should have carried on the
garden wall, and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard, just
as Dr. Grant has done. We were always doing something as it was. It was
only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris's death that we put in the
apricot against the stable wall, which is now grown such a noble tree,
and getting to such perfection, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>addressing herself then to Dr.
Grant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div>replied Dr. Grant. <div class="bookquote">``The
soil is good; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit
should be so little worth the trouble of gathering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park, and it cost
us--that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill--and I
know it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were imposed on, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div>replied Dr. Grant: <div class="bookquote">``these potatoes have as
much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree. It
is an insipid fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable, which
none from my garden are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Grant, pretending to whisper across
the table to Mrs. Norris, <div class="bookquote">``that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural
taste of our apricot is: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it
is so valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is such a
remarkably large, fair sort, that what with early tarts and preserves,
my cook contrives to get them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased; and, for a little
while, other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton. Dr.
Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had
begun in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.

<p/>After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again. <div class="bookquote">``Smith's place
is the admiration of all the country; and it was a mere nothing before
Repton took it in hand. I think I shall have Repton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Rushworth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram, <div class="bookquote">``if I were you, I would have a
very pretty shrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine
weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) ladyship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) acquiescence, and
tried to make out something complimentary; but, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) submission
to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_ taste, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) having always intended the same himself, with
the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies
in general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was
anxious to please, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) grew puzzled, and Edmund was glad to put an end
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) speech by a proposal of wine. Mr. Rushworth, however, though not
usually a great talker, had still more to say on the subject next his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
heart. <div class="bookquote">``Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
grounds, which is little enough, and makes it more surprising that the
place can have been so improved. Now, at Sotherton we have a good seven
hundred, without reckoning the water meadows; so that I think, if so
much could be done at Compton, we need not despair. There have been two
or three fine old trees cut down, that grew too near the house, and
it opens the prospect amazingly, which makes me think that Repton, or
anybody of that sort, would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down:
the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill,
you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bertram</b></font>)</div>turning to Miss Bertram particularly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) spoke. But Miss
Bertram thought it most becoming to reply--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The avenue! Oh! I do not recollect it. I really know very little of
Sotherton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund, exactly opposite
Miss Crawford, and who had been attentively listening, now looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and said in a low voice--

<p/>``Cut down an avenue! What a pity! Does it not make you think of Cowper?
`Ye fallen avenues, once more I mourn your fate unmerited.'''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Repton</b></font>) smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Repton</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance,
Fanny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down, to see the place
as it is now, in its old state; but I do not suppose I shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you never been there? No, you never can; and, unluckily, it is out
of distance for a ride. I wish we could contrive it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! it does not signify. Whenever I do see it, you will tell me how it
has been altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I collect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``that Sotherton is an old place, and a
place of some grandeur. In any particular style of building?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The house was built in Elizabeth's time, and is a large, regular, brick
building; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good rooms. It
is ill placed. It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park; in that
respect, unfavourable for improvement. But the woods are fine, and
there is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made a good deal of. Mr.
Rushworth is quite right, I think, in meaning to give it a modern dress,
and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford listened with submission, and said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) is a
well-bred man; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) makes the best of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``but, had I
a place to new fashion, I should not put myself into the hands of an
improver. I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own
choice, and acquired progressively. I would rather abide by my own
blunders than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_You_ would know what you were about, of course; but that would not
suit _me_. I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters, but as they are
before me; and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be most
thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it, and give me as much
beauty as he (<font color='blue'><b>Repton</b></font>) could for my money; and I should never look at it till it
was complete.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be delightful to _me_ to see the progress of it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said
Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, you have been brought up to it. It was no part of my education; and
the only dose I ever had, being administered by not the first favourite
in the world, has made me consider improvements _in_ _hand_ as the
greatest of nuisances. Three years ago the Admiral, my honoured uncle,
bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in;
and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures; but it being
excessively pretty, it was soon found necessary to be improved, and for
three months we were all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk to
step on, or a bench fit for use. I would have everything as complete
as possible in the country, shrubberies and flower-gardens, and rustic
seats innumerable: but it must all be done without my care. Henry is
different; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) loves to be doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was much disposed to
admire, speak so freely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle. It did not suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sense of
propriety, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was silenced, till induced by further smiles and
liveliness to put the matter by for the present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bertram,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have tidings of my harp at last. I am
assured that it is safe at Northampton; and there it has probably been
these ten days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often
received to the contrary.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Edmund expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) pleasure and surprise.
<div class="bookquote">``The truth is, that our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant,
we went ourselves: this will not do seventy miles from London; but this
morning we heard of it in the right way. It was seen by some farmer, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) told the miller, and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher's
son-in-law left word at the shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means, and hope
there will be no further delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it is to be conveyed?
Not by a wagon or cart: oh no! nothing of that kind could be hired in
the village. I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would find it difficult, I dare say, just now, in the middle of a
very late hay harvest, to hire a horse and cart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it! To want
a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible, so I told my maid to
speak for one directly; and as I cannot look out of my dressing-closet
without seeing one farmyard, nor walk in the shrubbery without passing
another, I thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather grieved
that I could not give the advantage to all. Guess my surprise, when
I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable, most impossible
thing in the world; had offended all the farmers, all the labourers,
all the hay in the parish! As for Dr. Grant's bailiff, I believe I had
better keep out of _his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_ way; and my brother-in-law himself, who is all
kindness in general, looked rather black upon me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found what I
had been at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before; but
when you _do_ think of it, you must see the importance of getting in
the grass. The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you
suppose: our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but, in
harvest, it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down with the
true London maxim, that everything is to be got with money, I was a
little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country
customs. However, I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry, who is
good-nature itself, has offered to fetch it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) barouche. Will it not
be honourably conveyed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund spoke of the harp as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) favourite instrument, and hoped to be
soon allowed to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Fanny had never heard the harp at all, and
wished for it very much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be most happy to play to you both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford; <div class="bookquote">``at
least as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for
I dearly love music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the
player must always be best off, for she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is gratified in more ways than
one. Now, Mr. Bertram, if you write to your brother, I entreat you to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) that my harp is come: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) heard so much of my misery about it.
And you may say, if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive
airs against his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) return, in compassion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) feelings, as I know his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
horse will lose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not, at present,
foresee any occasion for writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I dare say, nor if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you ever
write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to you, if it could be helped. The occasion would
never be foreseen. What strange creatures brothers are! You would not
write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world; and
when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill, or such
a relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words. You have but
one style among you. I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in every other
respect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me,
confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never
yet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more
than--`Dear Mary, I am just arrived. Bath seems full, and everything
as usual. Yours sincerely.' That is the true manly style; that is a
complete brother's letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When they are at a distance from all their family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny,
colouring for William's sake, <div class="bookquote">``they can write long letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Price has a brother at sea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``whose excellence as a
correspondent makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) think you too severe upon us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At sea, has she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)? In the king's service, of course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) determined
silence obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to relate her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother's situation: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) voice was
animated in speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) profession, and the foreign stations he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
been on; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not mention the number of years that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been
absent without tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes. Miss Crawford civilly wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) an
early promotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know anything of my cousin's captain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund; <div class="bookquote">``Captain
Marshall? You have a large acquaintance in the navy, I conclude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Among admirals, large enough; but,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with an air of grandeur, <div class="bookquote">``we know
very little of the inferior ranks. Post-captains may be very good sort
of men, but they do not belong to _us_. Of various admirals I could tell
you a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of their
pay, and their bickerings and jealousies. But, in general, I can assure
you that they are all passed over, and all very ill used. Certainly, my
home at my uncle's brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of
_Rears_ and _Vices_ I saw enough. Now do not be suspecting me of a pun,
I entreat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund again felt grave, and only replied, <div class="bookquote">``It is a noble profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances: if it make
the fortune, and there be discretion in spending it; but, in short, it
is not a favourite profession of mine. It has never worn an amiable form
to _me_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy in the prospect of
hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) play.

<p/>The subject of improving grounds, meanwhile, was still under
consideration among the others; and Mrs. Grant could not help addressing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) brother, though it was calling his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attention from Miss Julia
Bertram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Henry, have _you_ nothing to say? You have been an improver
yourself, and from what I hear of Everingham, it may vie with any place
in England. Its natural beauties, I am sure, are great. Everingham,
as it _used_ to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall of
ground, and such timber! What would I not give to see it again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answer; <div class="bookquote">``but I fear there would be some disappointment: you
would not find it equal to your present ideas. In extent, it is a mere
nothing; you would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as for
improvement, there was very little for me to do--too little: I should
like to have been busy much longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are fond of the sort of thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>said Julia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excessively; but what with the natural advantages of the ground, which
pointed out, even to a very young eye, what little remained to be done,
and my own consequent resolutions, I had not been of age three
months before Everingham was all that it is now. My plan was laid
at Westminster, a little altered, perhaps, at Cambridge, and at
one-and-twenty executed. I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having
so much happiness yet before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). I have been a devourer of my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>said Julia. <div class="bookquote">``_You_ can never want employment. Instead of envying Mr.
Rushworth, you should assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) with your opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech, enforced it warmly,
persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) brother's; and as
Miss Bertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) full support,
declaring that, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) opinion, it was infinitely better to consult
with friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw the
business into the hands of a professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very
ready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford's assistance; and Mr.
Crawford, after properly depreciating his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own abilities, was quite at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) service in any way that could be useful. Mr. Rushworth then began to
propose Mr. Crawford's doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) the honour of coming over to Sotherton,
and taking a bed there; when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) two
nieces' minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr.
Crawford away, interposed with an amendment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford's willingness; but why should not
more of us go? Why should not we make a little party? Here are many that
would be interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth, and
that would like to hear Mr. Crawford's opinion on the spot, and that
might be of some small use to you with _their_ opinions; and, for my
own part, I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again;
nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss; but
now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth, while the rest
of you walked about and settled things, and then we could all return
to a late dinner here, or dine at Sotherton, just as might be most
agreeable to your mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight.
I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) barouche,
and Edmund can go on horseback, you know, sister, and Fanny will stay at
home with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in the going
was forward in expressing their ready concurrence, excepting Edmund, who
heard it all and said nothing.



<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund the
next day, after thinking some time on the subject himself. <div class="bookquote">``How did you
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) yesterday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--very much. I like to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) talk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) entertains me; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) countenance that is so attractive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has a wonderful play
of feature! But was there nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) conversation that struck you,
Fanny, as not quite right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought not to have spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did. I was
quite astonished. An uncle with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has been living so many years,
and who, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) faults may be, is so very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother,
treating him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you would be struck. It was very wrong; very indecorous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And very ungrateful, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle has any claim
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _gratitude_; his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wife certainly had; and it is the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's memory which misleads her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) here. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is awkwardly
circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be
difficult to do justice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) affection for Mrs. Crawford, without
throwing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which was most
to blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral's present conduct
might incline one to the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wife; but it is natural and amiable
that Miss Crawford should acquit her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) aunt entirely. I do not censure her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
_opinions_; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in making them public.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, after a little consideration, <div class="bookquote">``that this
impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) niece has
been entirely brought up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cannot have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) right notions
of what was due to the Admiral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the faults of the niece
to have been those of the aunt; and it makes one more sensible of the
disadvantages she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has been under. But I think her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) present home must
do her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) good. Mrs. Grant's manners are just what they ought to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
speaks of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) brother with a very pleasing affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, except as to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) writing her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) such short letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) made me
almost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature
of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything
worth reading to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters, when they are separated. I am sure William
would never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances. And what right
had she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters when you were
absent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute
to its own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when
untinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of
either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or
loud, or coarse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we
have been speaking of. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cannot be justified. I am glad you saw
it all as I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Having formed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind and gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) affections, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had a good chance
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thinking like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); though at this period, and on this subject,
there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was in a line
of admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) where Fanny
could not follow. Miss Crawford's attractions did not lessen. The harp
arrived, and rather added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) beauty, wit, and good-humour; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
played with the greatest obligingness, with an expression and taste
which were peculiarly becoming, and there was something clever to be
said at the close of every air. Edmund was at the Parsonage every day,
to be indulged with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) favourite instrument: one morning secured an
invitation for the next; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a
listener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.

<p/>A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and
both placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a
little lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was
enough to catch any man's heart. The season, the scene, the air, were
all favourable to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tambour
frame were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and as
everything will turn to account when love is once set going, even the
sandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth looking
at. Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was
about, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such intercourse,
to be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady it may be added
that, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) being a man of the world or an elder brother, without
any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) began to
be agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt it to be so, though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not foreseen,
and could hardly understand it; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was not pleasant by any common
rule: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) talked no nonsense; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) paid no compliments; his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) opinions
were unbending, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attentions tranquil and simple. There was a charm,
perhaps, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sincerity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) steadiness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) integrity, which Miss
Crawford might be equal to feel, though not equal to discuss with
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not think very much about it, however: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
for the present; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) liked to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) near her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); it was enough.

<p/>Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would gladly have been there too, might she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) have gone in uninvited
and unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wonder that, when the
evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should
think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister to their home, while
Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) thought it
a very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and
water for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), would rather go without it than not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was a little
surprised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford, and
not see more of the sort of fault which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had already observed, and of
which _she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) company; but so it was. Edmund was fond of
speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) of Miss Crawford, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) seemed to think it enough that
the Admiral had since been spared; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) scrupled to point out her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own
remarks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), lest it should appear like ill-nature. The first actual
pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was the consequence of an
inclination to learn to ride, which the former caught, soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
being settled at Mansfield, from the example of the young ladies at the
Park, and which, when Edmund's acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) increased, led to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) encouraging the wish, and the offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own quiet mare for the
purpose of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) first attempts, as the best fitted for a beginner that
either stable could furnish. No pain, no injury, however, was designed
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) cousin in this offer: _she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)_ was not to lose a day's
exercise by it. The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half
an hour before her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) ride were to begin; and Fanny, on its being first
proposed, so far from feeling slighted, was almost over-powered with
gratitude that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should be asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) leave for it.

<p/>Miss Crawford made her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) first essay with great credit to herself, and no
inconvenience to Fanny. Edmund, who had taken down the mare and presided
at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before either Fanny or
the steady old coachman, who always attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rode without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins, were ready to set forward. The second day's trial was not
so guiltless. Miss Crawford's enjoyment of riding was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did
not know how to leave off. Active and fearless, and though rather small,
strongly made, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to the pure
genuine pleasure of the exercise, something was probably added in
Edmund's attendance and instructions, and something more in the
conviction of very much surpassing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sex in general by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) early
progress, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) unwilling to dismount. Fanny was ready and
waiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) for not being gone,
and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared. To avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) aunt,
and look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) went out.

<p/>The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of
each other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could
look down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its
demesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant's
meadow she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) immediately saw the group--Edmund and Miss Crawford both on
horse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,
with two or three grooms, standing about and looking on. A happy party
it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a
doubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). It was a sound
which did not make _her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_ cheerful; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) wondered that Edmund should
forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), and felt a pang. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes from the
meadow; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not help watching all that passed. At first Miss
Crawford and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) companion made the circuit of the field, which was not
small, at a foot's pace; then, at _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ apparent suggestion, they rose
into a canter; and to Fanny's timid nature it was most astonishing to
see how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmund
was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was evidently directing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
management of the bridle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw it, or the
imagination supplied what the eye could not reach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must not wonder
at all this; what could be more natural than that Edmund should be
making himself useful, and proving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) good-nature by any one? She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
not but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
the trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and becoming
in a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
boasted good-nature, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) coachmanship, probably knew nothing
of the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty; if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised
by seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still on
horseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the
lane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) stood.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked
to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Price,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was at all
within hearing, <div class="bookquote">``I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you
waiting; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself--I knew it
was very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if
you please, you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven,
you know, because there is no hope of a cure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny's answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) conviction that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could be in no hurry. <div class="bookquote">``For there is more than time enough for my
cousin to ride twice as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) ever goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and you have
been promoting her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) comfort by preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) from setting off half an
hour sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) will not suffer from the
heat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) would have done then. I wish _you_ may not be fatigued by so
much exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sprang down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) help; <div class="bookquote">``I am very strong. Nothing
ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way to
you with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant
ride, and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear,
delightful, beautiful animal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The old coachman, who had been waiting about with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own horse, now
joining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another
part of the park; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together to
the village; nor did her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attendant do her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) much good by his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) comments on
Miss Crawford's great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) had been
watching with an interest almost equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I never see one sit a horse better. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not seem to have
a thought of fear. Very different from you, miss, when you first began,
six years ago come next Easter. Lord bless you! how you did tremble when
Sir Thomas first had you put on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>In the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) merit in
being gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated
by the Miss Bertrams; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) delight in riding was like their own; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>)
early excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasure
in praising it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would ride well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>said Julia; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has the make for it.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) figure is as neat as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>added Maria, <div class="bookquote">``and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spirits are as good, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has the same
energy of character. I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a
great deal to do with the mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/>When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) meant to ride
the next day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I do not know--not if you want the mare,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not want her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) at all for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but whenever you are
next inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) a longer time--for a whole morning, in short. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has a great
desire to get as far as Mansfield Common: Mrs. Grant has been telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) being perfectly equal
to it. But any morning will do for this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would be extremely sorry to
interfere with you. It would be very wrong if she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) did. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_ rides only
for pleasure; _you_ for health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny; <div class="bookquote">``I have been out
very often lately, and would rather stay at home. You know I am strong
enough now to walk very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny's comfort, and the ride to
Mansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all the
young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly
enjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of this
sort generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield
Common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. There
were many other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot, there
were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is always
provided with a shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were spent
in this manner, in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing the
honours of its finest spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety and
good-humour, the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked
of with pleasure--till the fourth day, when the happiness of one of
the party was exceedingly clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund and
Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage, and _she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)_ was excluded.
It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant, with perfect good-humour, on Mr.
Rushworth's account, who was partly expected at the Park that day;
but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) good manners were
severely taxed to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) vexation and anger till she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) reached home.
As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was increased, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had
not even the relief of shewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could only be
sullen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) mother, aunt, and cousin, and throw as great a gloom as
possible over their dinner and dessert.

<p/>Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,
fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse
of what they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would
scarcely raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) book, and Lady Bertram was half-asleep;
and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) niece's ill-humour, and having
asked one or two questions about the dinner, which were not immediately
attended to, seemed almost determined to say no more. For a few minutes
the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and
their remarks on the stars, to think beyond themselves; but when the
first pause came, Edmund, looking around, said, <div class="bookquote">``But where is Fanny? Is
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gone to bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not that I know of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Norris; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was here a moment
ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which was
a very long one, told them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was on the sofa. Mrs. Norris began
scolding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the evening
upon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as
_we_ do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the
poor basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week,
not touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out. You
should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it is a
shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Before half this was said, Fanny was returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat at the table,
and had taken up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) work again; and Julia, who was in high good-humour,
from the pleasures of the day, did her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) the justice of exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``I
must say, ma’am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, after looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) attentively, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure you
have the headache.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``I know your looks too well. How
long have you had it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since a little before dinner. It is nothing but the heat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you go out in the heat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go out! to be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Norris: <div class="bookquote">``would you have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stay
within such a fine day as this? Were not we _all_ out? Even your mother
was out to-day for above an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, Edmund,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>added her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) ladyship, who had been thoroughly
awakened by Mrs. Norris's sharp reprimand to Fanny; <div class="bookquote">``I was out above an
hour. I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny
cut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It
was shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the coming
home again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny has been cutting roses, has she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing! _She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_
found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could not
wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was no help for it, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Norris, in a rather
softened voice; <div class="bookquote">``but I question whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) headache might not be caught
_then_, sister. There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and
stooping in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well to-morrow. Suppose
you let her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have your aromatic vinegar; I always forget to have mine
filled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has had it ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) came
back from your house the second time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Edmund; <div class="bookquote">``has she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) been walking as well as cutting roses;
walking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma’am? No
wonder her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head aches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid it would be too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram; <div class="bookquote">``but
when the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then
you know they must be taken home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But were there roses enough to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to go twice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and, unluckily,
Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was obliged to go again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund got up and walked about the room, saying, <div class="bookquote">``And could nobody be
employed on such an errand but Fanny? Upon my word, ma’am, it has been a
very ill-managed business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried
Mrs. Norris, unable to be longer deaf; <div class="bookquote">``unless I had gone myself,
indeed; but I cannot be in two places at once; and I was talking to Mr.
Green at that very time about your mother's dairymaid, by _her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)_ desire,
and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his (<font color='blue'><b>Groom</b></font>) son,
and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour. I think nobody
can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really I
cannot do everything at once. And as for Fanny's just stepping down
to my house for me--it is not much above a quarter of a mile--I cannot
think I was unreasonable to ask it. How often do I pace it three times a
day, early and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Fanny would be more regular in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) exercise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not be
knocked up so soon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has not been out on horseback now this long
while, and I am persuaded that, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not ride, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to
walk. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been riding before, I should not have asked it of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
But I thought it would rather do her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good after being stooping among the
roses; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue
of that kind; and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.
Between ourselves, Edmund,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>nodding significantly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``it was
cutting the roses, and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that did the
mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it was, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said the more candid Lady Bertram, who had
overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I am very much afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) caught the headache there,
for the heat was enough to kill anybody. It was as much as I could bear
myself. Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Pug</b></font>) from the
flower-beds, was almost too much for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table,
on which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira to
Fanny, and obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to drink the greater part. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished to be able
to decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made
it easier to swallow than to speak.

<p/>Vexed as Edmund was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother and aunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was still more angry
with himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own forgetfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was worse than anything which
they had done. Nothing of this would have happened had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) been properly
considered; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been left four days together without any choice
of companions or exercise, and without any excuse for avoiding whatever
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unreasonable aunts might require. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was ashamed to think that
for four days together she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not had the power of riding, and very
seriously resolved, however unwilling he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must be to check a pleasure of
Miss Crawford's, that it should never happen again.

<p/>Fanny went to bed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart as full as on the first evening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
arrival at the Park. The state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits had probably had its
share in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) indisposition; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been feeling neglected, and been
struggling against discontent and envy for some days past. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) leant
on the sofa, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had retreated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might not be seen, the
pain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind had been much beyond that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head; and the sudden
change which Edmund's kindness had then occasioned, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hardly know
how to support herself.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>Fanny's rides recommenced the very next day; and as it was a pleasant
fresh-feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been, Edmund
trusted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) losses, both of health and pleasure, would be soon made
good. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) mother,
who came to be civil and to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) civility especially, in urging the
execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been started a
fortnight before, and which, in consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) subsequent absence
from home, had since lain dormant. Mrs. Norris and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nieces were all
well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and agreed
to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies did
not forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly have
answered for his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being so, they would neither authorise the liberty nor
run the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth
discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) to walk down
to the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and inquire whether
Wednesday would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) or not.

<p/>Before his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in. Having been out
some time, and taken a different route to the house, they had not met
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Comfortable hopes, however, were given that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would find Mr.
Crawford at home. The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. It was
hardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of,
for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, a
well-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of
consequence, but as it related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) son's concerns,
had not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party. Lady
Bertram constantly declined it; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) placid manner of refusal made
Mrs. Rushworth still think she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) wished to come, till Mrs. Norris's more
numerous words and louder tone convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) of the truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, I
assure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth. Ten miles there, and ten back, you
know. You must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our
two dear girls and myself without her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Sotherton is the only place that
could give her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a _wish_ to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will
have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very well;
and as for Edmund, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is not here to speak for himself, I will answer
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) being most happy to join the party. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) can go on horseback, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram's staying at home,
could only be sorry. <div class="bookquote">``The loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ladyship's company would be a
great drawback, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should have been extremely happy to have seen
the young lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet, and
it was a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) should not see the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs.
Norris; <div class="bookquote">``but as to Fanny, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will have opportunities in plenty of
seeing Sotherton. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has time enough before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) going now is
quite out of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! I cannot do without Fanny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must
be wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the invitation;
and though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs.
Rushworth, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) coming into the neighbourhood, civilly declined it on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was glad to secure any pleasure for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) sister;
and Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in accepting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) share of the civility. Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage
successful; and Edmund made his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) appearance just in time to learn
what had been settled for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
carriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two other ladies.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) return to the breakfast-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) found Mrs. Norris trying to
make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) mind as to whether Miss Crawford's being of the party were
desirable or not, or whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) brother's barouche would not be full
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) that
the barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, on
which _one_ might go with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why is it necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``that Crawford's carriage, or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _only_, should be employed? Why is no use to be made of my mother's
chaise? I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other
day, understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the
carriage of the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>cried Julia: <div class="bookquote">``go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather,
when we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that will not
quite do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, <div class="bookquote">``I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us.
After what passed at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would claim it as a promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, my dear Edmund,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Norris, <div class="bookquote">``taking out _two_ carriages
when _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between
ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and
Sotherton: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford's,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria; <div class="bookquote">``but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and
does not know how to drive. I will answer for it that we shall find no
inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``in
going on the barouche box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unpleasant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>cried Maria: <div class="bookquote">``oh dear! I believe it would be generally
thought the favourite seat. There can be no comparison as to one's view
of the country. Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box
herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no objection, then, to Fanny's going with you; there can
be no doubt of your having room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Norris; <div class="bookquote">``my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
going with us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stays with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt. I told Mrs. Rushworth so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is
not expected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can have no reason, I imagine, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mother, <div class="bookquote">``for wishing Fanny _not_ to be of the party, but as it relates
to yourself, to your own comfort. If you could do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), you would
not wish to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure not, but I _cannot_ do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a general cry out at this. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``there is no
necessity for my going, and I mean to stay at home. Fanny has a great
desire to see Sotherton. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wishes it very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has not
often a gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma’am, you would be
glad to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the pleasure now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could
remain--their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could
not go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a difficulty quite impossible to be got
over. It must have the strangest appearance! It would be something so
very unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth, whose
own manners were such a pattern of good-breeding and attention, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
really did not feel equal to it. Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny,
and no wish of procuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pleasure at any time; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) opposition to
Edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own scheme, because it
_was_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own, than from anything else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had arranged
everything extremely well, and that any alteration must be for the
worse. When Edmund, therefore, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in reply, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the hearing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) need not distress herself on Mrs.
Rushworth's account, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had taken the opportunity, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) walked
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) through the hall, of mentioning Miss Price as one who would
probably be of the party, and had directly received a very sufficient
invitation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) cousin, Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with
a very good grace, and would only say, <div class="bookquote">``Very well, very well, just as
you chuse, settle it your own way, I am sure I do not care about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems very odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, <div class="bookquote">``that you should be staying at home
instead of Fanny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to be very much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>added Julia,
hastily leaving the room as she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) spoke, from a consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
ought to offer to stay at home herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>was
Edmund's only reply, and the subject dropt.

<p/>Fanny's gratitude, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heard the plan, was, in fact, much greater
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt Edmund's kindness with all, and more than
all, the sensibility which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), unsuspicious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fond attachment,
could be aware of; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should forego any enjoyment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
account gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pain, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton
would be nothing without him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/>The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another
alteration in the plan, and one that was admitted with general
approbation. Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to Lady
Bertram in lieu of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) son, and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner.
Lady Bertram was very well pleased to have it so, and the young ladies
were in spirits again. Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement
which restored him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) share of the party; and Mrs. Norris thought it
an excellent plan, and had it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) tongue's end, and was on the point
of proposing it, when Mrs. Grant spoke.

<p/>Wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr.
Crawford driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sisters; and as everybody was ready, there was
nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take
their places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post of
honour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall? While
each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most
appearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settled
by Mrs. Grant's saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stepped from the carriage, <div class="bookquote">``As there are
five of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry; and as
you were saying lately that you wished you could drive, Julia, I think
this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Happy Julia! Unhappy Maria! The former was on the barouche-box in a
moment, the latter took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) seat within, in gloom and mortification; and
the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies,
and the barking of Pug in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pug</b></font>) mistress's arms.

<p/>Their road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny, whose rides had
never been extensive, was soon beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knowledge, and was very happy
in observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
not often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) desire it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own thoughts and reflections were habitually her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
best companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the
bearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the harvest,
the cottages, the cattle, the children, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found entertainment that
could only have been heightened by having Edmund to speak to of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
felt. That was the only point of resemblance between her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and the lady
who sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>): in everything but a value for Edmund, Miss Crawford was
very unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had none of Fanny's delicacy of taste, of mind, of
feeling; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) saw Nature, inanimate Nature, with little observation;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attention was all for men and women, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) talents for the light
and lively. In looking back after Edmund, however, when there was any
stretch of road behind them, or when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gained on them in ascending a
considerable hill, they were united, and a <div class="bookquote">``there he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>broke at the
same moment from them both, more than once.

<p/>For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sister sitting side by
side, full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) expressive
profile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the laugh of
the other, was a perpetual source of irritation, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) own sense
of propriety could but just smooth over. When Julia looked back, it was
with a countenance of delight, and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) spoke to them, it was in
the highest spirits: <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) view of the country was charming, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) wished
they could all see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spirits</b></font>)</div>etc.; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) only offer of exchange was
addressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long hill,
and was not more inviting than this: <div class="bookquote">``Here is a fine burst of country. I
wish you had my seat, but I dare say you will not take it, let me press
you ever so much;''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they
were moving again at a good pace.

<p/>When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations, it was
better for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have two strings to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
bow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had Rushworth feelings, and Crawford feelings, and in
the vicinity of Sotherton the former had considerable effect. Mr.
Rushworth's consequence was hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not tell Miss Crawford that
<div class="bookquote">``those woods belonged to Sotherton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not carelessly observe
that <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth's property on each
side of the road,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure
to increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion,
and ancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of
court-leet and court-baron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficulties
are over. The rest of the way is such as it ought to be. Mr. Rushworth
has made it since he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) succeeded to the estate. Here begins the village.
Those cottages are really a disgrace. The church spire is reckoned
remarkably handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the great
house as often happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must be
terrible. There is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and I understand
the clergyman and his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) wife are very decent people. Those are almshouses,
built by some of the family. To the right is the steward's house; he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)
is a very respectable man. Now we are coming to the lodge-gates; but we
have nearly a mile through the park still. It is not ugly, you see, at
this end; there is some fine timber, but the situation of the house is
dreadful. We go down hill to it for half a mile, and it is a pity, for
it would not be an ill-looking place if it had a better approach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford was not slow to admire; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) pretty well guessed Miss
Bertram's feelings, and made it a point of honour to promote her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
enjoyment to the utmost. Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility; and
even Fanny had something to say in admiration, and might be heard with
complacency. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eye was eagerly taking in everything within her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reach;
and after being at some pains to get a view of the house, and observing
that <div class="bookquote">``it was a sort of building which she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) could not look at but with
respect,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Now, where is the avenue? The house fronts the
east, I perceive. The avenue, therefore, must be at the back of it. Mr.
Rushworth talked of the west front.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, and
ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. You may see
something of it here--something of the more distant trees. It is oak
entirely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had
known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) opinion; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish,
when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal
entrance.



<p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) fair lady; and the whole
party were welcomed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) with due attention. In the drawing-room they
were met with equal cordiality by the mother, and Miss Bertram had all
the distinction with each that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could wish. After the business of
arriving was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors were
thrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the
appointed dining-parlour, where a collation was prepared with abundance
and elegance. Much was said, and much was ate, and all went well. The
particular object of the day was then considered. How would Mr. Crawford
like, in what manner would he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) chuse, to take a survey of the grounds?
Mr. Rushworth mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) curricle. Mr. Crawford suggested the greater
desirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two. <div class="bookquote">``To be
depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments,
might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also; but this
was scarcely received as an amendment: the young ladies neither smiled
nor spoke. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) next proposition, of shewing the house to such of them
as had not been there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertram
was pleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doing
something.

<p/>The whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth's guidance
were shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty, and many large, and
amply furnished in the taste of fifty years back, with shining floors,
solid mahogany, rich damask, marble, gilding, and carving, each handsome
in its way. Of pictures there were abundance, and some few good, but
the larger part were family portraits, no longer anything to anybody
but Mrs. Rushworth, who had been at great pains to learn all that the
housekeeper could teach, and was now almost equally well qualified to
shew the house. On the present occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) addressed herself chiefly to
Miss Crawford and Fanny, but there was no comparison in the willingness
of their attention; for Miss Crawford, who had seen scores of great
houses, and cared for none of them, had only the appearance of civilly
listening, while Fanny, to whom everything was almost as interesting
as it was new, attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs.
Rushworth could relate of the family in former times, its rise and
grandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts, delighted to connect anything
with history already known, or warm her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) imagination with scenes of the
past.

<p/>The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect
from any of the rooms; and while Fanny and some of the others were
attending Mrs. Rushworth, Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) head at the windows. Every room on the west front looked across
a lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron
palisades and gates.

<p/>Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any
other use than to contribute to the window-tax, and find employment for
housemaids, <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>housemaids</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rushworth, <div class="bookquote">``we are coming to the chapel,
which properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon; but
as we are quite among friends, I will take you in this way, if you will
excuse me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/>They entered. Fanny's imagination had prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) for something
grander than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of
devotion: with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion
of mahogany, and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of
the family gallery above. <div class="bookquote">``I am disappointed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), in a low voice,
to Edmund. ``This is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing awful
here, nothing melancholy, nothing grand. Here are no aisles, no arches,
no inscriptions, no banners. No banners, cousin, to be `blown by the
night wind of heaven.' No signs that a `Scottish monarch sleeps below.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how
confined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and
monasteries. It was only for the private use of the family. They have
been buried, I suppose, in the parish church. _There_ you must look for
the banners and the achievements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rushworth began her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) relation. <div class="bookquote">``This chapel was fitted up as you see
it, in James the Second's time. Before that period, as I understand,
the pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think that
the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple
cloth; but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome chapel, and was
formerly in constant use both morning and evening. Prayers were always
read in it by the domestic chaplain, within the memory of many; but the
late Mr. Rushworth left it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every generation has its improvements,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, with a
smile, to Edmund.

<p/>Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) lesson to Mr. Crawford; and
Edmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``that the custom should have been
discontinued. It was a valuable part of former times. There is something
in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house,
with one's ideas of what such a household should be! A whole family
assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very fine indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``It must do the heads
of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and
footmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here twice
a day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_That_ is hardly Fanny's idea of a family assembling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund. <div class="bookquote">``If
the master and mistress do _not_ attend themselves, there must be more
harm than good in the custom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such
subjects. Everybody likes to go their own way--to chuse their own time
and manner of devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality, the
restraint, the length of time--altogether it is a formidable thing, and
what nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in
that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men
and women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke with a
headache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed,
they would have jumped with joy and envy. Cannot you imagine with what
unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did
many a time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs.
Bridgets--starched up into seeming piety, but with heads full of
something very different--especially if the poor chaplain were not worth
looking at--and, in those days, I fancy parsons were very inferior even
to what they are now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For a few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was unanswered. Fanny coloured and looked
at Edmund, but felt too angry for speech; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) needed a little
recollection before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could say, <div class="bookquote">``Your lively mind can hardly be
serious even on serious subjects. You have given us an amusing sketch,
and human nature cannot say it was not so. We must all feel _at_ _times_
the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish; but if you are
supposing it a frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown into a
habit from neglect, what could be expected from the _private_ devotions
of such persons? Do you think the minds which are suffered, which
are indulged in wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected in a
closet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very likely. They would have two chances at least in their favour.
There would be less to distract the attention from without, and it would
not be tried so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The mind which does not struggle against itself under _one_
circumstance, would find objects to distract it in the _other_, I
believe; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse
better feelings than are begun with. The greater length of the service,
however, I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. One
wishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to
forget what chapel prayers are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/>While this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the
chapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford's attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister, by saying,
<div class="bookquote">``Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as
if the ceremony were going to be performed. Have not they completely the
air of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Crawford smiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) acquiescence, and stepping forward to Maria,
said, in a voice which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) only could hear, <div class="bookquote">``I do not like to see Miss
Bertram so near the altar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Starting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two, but recovering
herself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), in a tone not
much louder, <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) reply, with a look
of meaning.

<p/>Julia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place
directly, if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether,
and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the
comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) mother, and expose her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister to
the whispered gallantries of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lover, while Mrs. Rushworth spoke
with proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
whenever it took place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Edmund were but in orders!''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>cried Julia, and running to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny: <div class="bookquote">``My dear Edmund, if you were but in
orders now, you might perform the ceremony directly. How unlucky that
you are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford's countenance, as Julia spoke, might have amused a
disinterested observer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) looked almost aghast under the new idea she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
was receiving. Fanny pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How distressed she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) will be at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
said just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>passed across her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ordained!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford; <div class="bookquote">``what, are you to be a clergyman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I shall take orders soon after my father's return--probably at
Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford, rallying her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spirits, and recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) complexion,
replied only, <div class="bookquote">``If I had known this before, I would have spoken of the
cloth with more respect,''  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>and turned the subject.

<p/>The chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness
which reigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year. Miss
Bertram, displeased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sister, led the way, and all seemed to feel
that they had been there long enough.

<p/>The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn, and Mrs.
Rushworth, never weary in the cause, would have proceeded towards the
principal staircase, and taken them through all the rooms above, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
son had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough. <div class="bookquote">``For
if,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), with the sort of self-evident proposition which many a
clearer head does not always avoid, <div class="bookquote">``we are _too_ long going over the
house, we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors. It is
past two, and we are to dine at five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying the grounds,
with the who and the how, was likely to be more fully agitated, and Mrs.
Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses
most could be done, when the young people, meeting with an outward door,
temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and
shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds, as by one impulse, one
wish for air and liberty, all walked out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose we turn down here for the present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rushworth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rushworth,
civilly taking the hint and following them. <div class="bookquote">``Here are the greatest
number of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Query,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Crawford, looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``whether we may not find
something to employ us here before we go farther? I see walls of great
promise. Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``James,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rushworth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Rushworth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``I believe the wilderness
will be new to all the party. The Miss Bertrams have never seen the
wilderness yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>No objection was made, but for some time there seemed no inclination to
move in any plan, or to any distance. All were attracted at first by the
plants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy independence.
Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilities
of that end of the house. The lawn, bounded on each side by a high wall,
contained beyond the first planted area a bowling-green, and beyond
the bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed by iron palisades, and
commanding a view over them into the tops of the trees of the wilderness
immediately adjoining. It was a good spot for fault-finding. Mr.
Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth; and when,
after a little time, the others began to form into parties, these three
were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund, Miss Crawford,
and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and who, after a short
participation of their regrets and difficulties, left them and walked
on. The remaining three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, were
still far behind; for Julia, whose happy star no longer prevailed,
was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth, and restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
impatient feet to that lady's slow pace, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) aunt, having fallen
in with the housekeeper, who was come out to feed the pheasants, was
lingering behind in gossip with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). Poor Julia, the only one out of
the nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot, was now in a state of
complete penance, and as different from the Julia of the barouche-box as
could well be imagined. The politeness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had been brought up to
practise as a duty made it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) to escape; while the
want of that higher species of self-command, that just consideration of
others, that knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) own heart, that principle of right, which
had not formed any essential part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) education, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) miserable
under it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is insufferably hot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, when they had taken one
turn on the terrace, and were drawing a second time to the door in the
middle which opened to the wilderness. <div class="bookquote">``Shall any of us object to being
comfortable? Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it.
What happiness if the door should not be locked! but of course it is;
for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go
where they like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were all agreed in
turning joyfully through it, and leaving the unmitigated glare of day
behind. A considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness,
which was a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly of
larch and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid out with too much
regularity, was darkness and shade, and natural beauty, compared with
the bowling-green and the terrace. They all felt the refreshment of it,
and for some time could only walk and admire. At length, after a short
pause, Miss Crawford began with, <div class="bookquote">``So you are to be a clergyman, Mr.
Bertram. This is rather a surprise to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should it surprise you? You must suppose me designed for some
profession, and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer, nor a
soldier, nor a sailor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me. And you know there
is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second
son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very praiseworthy practice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``but not quite universal.
I am one of the exceptions, and _being_ one, must do something for
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why are you to be a clergyman? I thought _that_ was always the lot
of the youngest, where there were many to chuse before him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think the church itself never chosen, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Never_ is a black word. But yes, in the _never_ of conversation, which
means _not_ _very_ _often_, I do think it. For what is to be done in the
church? Men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the other
lines distinction may be gained, but not in the church. A clergyman is
nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The _nothing_ of conversation has its gradations, I hope, as well as
the _never_. A clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) must
not head mobs, or set the ton in dress. But I cannot call that situation
nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance
to mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally and
eternally, which has the guardianship of religion and morals, and
consequently of the manners which result from their influence. No one
here can call the _office_ nothing. If the man who holds it is so, it
is by the neglect of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty, by foregoing its just importance, and
stepping out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place to appear what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought not to appear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_You_ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been
used to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend. One does not see
much of this influence and importance in society, and how can it be
acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves? How can two sermons a
week, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have
the sense to prefer Blair's to his (<font color='blue'><b>Blair</b></font>) own, do all that you speak of? govern
the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest
of the week? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) pulpit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_You_ are speaking of London, _I_ am speaking of the nation at large.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the
kingdom. We do not look in great cities for our best morality. It is not
there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; and
it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most
felt. A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in fine
preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) parish and
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size
capable of knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) private character, and observing his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) general
conduct, which in London can rarely be the case. The clergy are lost
there in the crowds of their parishioners. They are known to the largest
part only as preachers. And with regard to their influencing public
manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean to
call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of refinement
and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life. The _manners_ I
speak of might rather be called _conduct_, perhaps, the result of good
principles; the effect, in short, of those doctrines which it is their
duty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe, be everywhere
found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought to be, so are
the rest of the nation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, with gentle earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``you have quite convinced Miss Price
already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think you ever will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), with an arch smile; <div class="bookquote">``I am just
as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take
orders. You really are fit for something better. Come, do change your
mind. It is not too late. Go into the law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go into the law! With as much ease as I was told to go into this
wilderness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness
of the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have forestalled you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a
_bon_ _mot_, for there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a very
matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a
repartee for half an hour together without striking it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A general silence succeeded. Each was thoughtful. Fanny made the first
interruption by saying, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder that I should be tired with only
walking in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it
is not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little
while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Edmund, immediately drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arm within his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``how thoughtless I have been! I hope you are not very tired. Perhaps,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>turning to Miss Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``my other companion may do me the honour of
taking an arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, but I am not at all tired.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) took it, however, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
spoke, and the gratification of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) do so, of feeling such a
connexion for the first time, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) a little forgetful of Fanny.
<div class="bookquote">``You scarcely touch me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You do not make me of any use. What a
difference in the weight of a woman's arm from that of a man! At Oxford
I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of
a street, and you are only a fly in the comparison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am really not tired, which I almost wonder at; for we must have
walked at least a mile in this wood. Do not you think we have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not half a mile,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sturdy answer; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was not yet so much in
love as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you do not consider how much we have wound about. We have taken
such a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a mile
long in a straight line, for we have never seen the end of it yet since
we left the first great path.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you remember, before we left that first great path, we saw
directly to the end of it. We looked down the whole vista, and saw it
closed by iron gates, and it could not have been more than a furlong in
length.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure it is a very long
wood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into
it; and therefore, when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must
speak within compass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, taking
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think we are walking four miles an hour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! do not attack me with your watch. A watch is always too fast or too
slow. I cannot be dictated to by a watch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk they
had been talking of; and standing back, well shaded and sheltered, and
looking over a ha-ha into the park, was a comfortable-sized bench, on
which they all sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``why would not you speak sooner? This will be a bad day's amusement for
you if you are to be knocked up. Every sort of exercise fatigues her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so
soon, Miss Crawford, except riding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) horse as I did all
last week! I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Your_ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own
neglect. Fanny's interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for there
is nothing in the course of one's duties so fatiguing as what we have
been doing this morning: seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to
another, straining one's eyes and one's attention, hearing what one does
not understand, admiring what one does not care for. It is generally
allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price has found
it so, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) did not know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall soon be rested,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny; <div class="bookquote">``to sit in the shade on a fine
day, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again. <div class="bookquote">``I must move,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``resting fatigues me. I have looked across the ha-ha till I
am weary. I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view,
without being able to see it so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund left the seat likewise. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Miss Crawford, if you will look up
the walk, you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long,
or half half a mile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an immense distance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I see _that_ with a glance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) still reasoned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), but in vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would not calculate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
would not compare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would only smile and assert. The greatest degree
of rational consistency could not have been more engaging, and they
talked with mutual satisfaction. At last it was agreed that they should
endeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little
more about it. They would go to one end of it, in the line they were
then in--for there was a straight green walk along the bottom by
the side of the ha-ha--and perhaps turn a little way in some other
direction, if it seemed likely to assist them, and be back in a few
minutes. Fanny said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was rested, and would have moved too, but this
was not suffered. Edmund urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) remaining where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was with an
earnestness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not resist, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was left on the bench to
think with pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin's care, but with great regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was not stronger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) watched them till they had turned the corner, and
listened till all sound of them had ceased.



<p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>A quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still
thinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption
from any one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) began to be surprised at being left so long, and to
listen with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) listened, and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heard; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heard voices and feet
approaching; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had just satisfied herself that it was not those
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wanted, when Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued
from the same path which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had trod herself, and were before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Price all alone''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``My dear Fanny, how comes this?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were the
first salutations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) story. <div class="bookquote">``Poor dear Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
cousin, <div class="bookquote">``how ill you have been used by them! You had better have staid
with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) resumed
the conversation which had engaged them before, and discussed the
possibility of improvements with much animation. Nothing was fixed
on; but Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generally
speaking, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) proposed was immediately approved, first by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>),
and then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be to
hear the others, and who scarcely risked an original thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own
beyond a wish that they had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) friend Smith's place.

<p/>After some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram, observing the iron
gate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park, that their
views and their plans might be more comprehensive. It was the very thing
of all others to be wished, it was the best, it was the only way of
proceeding with any advantage, in Henry Crawford's opinion; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
directly saw a knoll not half a mile off, which would give them exactly
the requisite command of the house. Go therefore they must to that
knoll, and through that gate; but the gate was locked. Mr. Rushworth
wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had brought the key; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had been very near thinking whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
should not bring the key; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was determined he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) would never come without
the key again; but still this did not remove the present evil. They
could not get through; and as Miss Bertram's inclination for so doing
did by no means lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth's declaring outright
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) would go and fetch the key. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) set off accordingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far from
the house already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Crawford, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is nothing else to be done. But now, sincerely, do not you
find the place altogether worse than you expected?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander, more complete in
its style, though that style may not be the best. And to tell you the
truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>speaking rather lower, <div class="bookquote">``I do not think that _I_ shall ever see
Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer will
hardly improve it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment's embarrassment the lady replied, <div class="bookquote">``You are too much a
man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. If other people
think Sotherton improved, I have no doubt that you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be
good for me in some points. My feelings are not quite so evanescent, nor
my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the
case with men of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was followed by a short silence. Miss Bertram began again. <div class="bookquote">``You
seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. I was glad to
see you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollection
at what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) some ridiculous stories of
an old Irish groom of my uncle's. Your sister loves to laugh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) more light-hearted than I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More easily amused,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``consequently, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>smiling,
<div class="bookquote">``better company. I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish
anecdotes during a ten miles' drive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I have more to think
of now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very high
spirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are too
fair to justify want of spirits. You have a very smiling scene before
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean literally or figuratively? Literally, I conclude. Yes,
certainly, the sun shines, and the park looks very cheerful. But
unluckily that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint and
hardship. `I cannot get out,' as the starling said.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) spoke, and
it was with expression, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) walked to the gate: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Rushworth is so long fetching this key!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr.
Rushworth's authority and protection, or I think you might with little
difficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance;
I think it might be done, if you really wished to be more at large, and
could allow yourself to think it not prohibited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prohibited! nonsense! I certainly can get out that way, and I will.
Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out of
sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) will
find us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help making an effort to
prevent it. <div class="bookquote">``You will hurt yourself, Miss Bertram,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``you will
certainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown;
you will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had better not
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken,
and, smiling with all the good-humour of success, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you,
my dear Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was again left to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) solitude, and with no increase of pleasant
feelings, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was sorry for almost all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen and heard,
astonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford. By taking
a circuitous route, and, as it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), very unreasonable
direction to the knoll, they were soon beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) eye; and for some
minutes longer she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) remained without sight or sound of any companion.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) seemed to have the little wood all to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could almost
have thought that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it, but that it was
impossible for Edmund to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) so entirely.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:
somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
expected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath,
and with a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Heyday!
Where are the others? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty trick, upon my word! I cannot see them anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>looking
eagerly into the park. <div class="bookquote">``But they cannot be very far off, and I think I
am equal to as much as Maria, even without help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key. Do
wait for Mr. Rushworth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I, indeed. I have had enough of the family for one morning. Why,
child, I have but this moment escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) horrible mother. Such a
penance as I have been enduring, while you were sitting here so composed
and so happy! It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in my
place, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and let
it pass: Julia was vexed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) temper was hasty; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) felt that it
would not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
had not seen Mr. Rushworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was posting away as if upon life and death,
and could but just spare time to tell us his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) errand, and where you all
were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) should have so much trouble for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_That_ is Miss Maria's concern. I am not obliged to punish myself for
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)_ sins. The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt
was dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get away
from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not
attending to Fanny's last question of whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen anything of
Miss Crawford and Edmund. The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of
seeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thinking so much of their continued
absence, however, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had been
very ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had
passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) within five minutes after Julia's exit; and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) made the best of the story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was evidently mortified and
displeased in no common degree. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) scarcely said anything; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
looks only expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) extreme surprise and vexation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) walked to
the gate and stood there, without seeming to know what to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They desired me to stay--my cousin Maria charged me to say that you
would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe I shall go any farther,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) sullenly; <div class="bookquote">``I see
nothing of them. By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone
somewhere else. I have had walking enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it is very unlucky.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) longed to be
able to say something more to the purpose.

<p/>After an interval of silence, <div class="bookquote">``I think they might as well have staid for
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bertram thought you would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have had to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had staid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>This could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced. After another pause,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) went on--<div class="bookquote">``Pray, Miss Price, are you such a great admirer of this Mr.
Crawford as some people are? For my part, I can see nothing in him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at all handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Handsome! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not
five foot nine. I should not wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not more than five foot
eight. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an ill-looking fellow. In my opinion, these
Crawfords are no addition at all. We did very well without them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>A small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not know how to contradict
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have
been some excuse, but I went the very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) wanted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure, and I dare
say you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, you
know, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when people
are waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute seems
like five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) got up and walked to the gate again, and <div class="bookquote">``wished he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had had the key
about him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at the time.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Fanny thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) discerned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) standing
there an indication of relenting, which encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to another
attempt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, therefore, <div class="bookquote">``It is a pity you should not join
them. They expected to have a better view of the house from that part
of the park, and will be thinking how it may be improved; and nothing of
that sort, you know, can be settled without you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a
companion. Mr. Rushworth was worked on. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you
really think I had better go: it would be foolish to bring the key
for nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And letting himself out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) walked off without farther
ceremony.

<p/>Fanny's thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so
long ago, and getting quite impatient, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) resolved to go in search
of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) followed their steps along the bottom walk, and had just
turned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford
once more caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings
brought them before her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). They were just returned into the wilderness
from the park, to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very
soon after their leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and they had been across a portion of the
park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning
to reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees. This
was their history. It was evident that they had been spending their time
pleasantly, and were not aware of the length of their absence. Fanny's
best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had wished for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
very much, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should certainly have come back for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
not been tired already; but this was not quite sufficient to do away
with the pain of having been left a whole hour, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had talked of
only a few minutes, nor to banish the sort of curiosity she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt to know
what they had been conversing about all that time; and the result of
the whole was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) disappointment and depression, as they prepared by
general agreement to return to the house.

<p/>On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Mrs. Rushworth
and Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the
wilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the
house. Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatever
cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nieces,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper,
after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
to the dairy, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) all about their cows, and given her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) the receipt
for a famous cream cheese; and since Julia's leaving them they had
been met by the gardener, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had made a most satisfactory
acquaintance, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had set him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) right as to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) grandson's illness,
convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) that it was an ague, and promised him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) a charm for it; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), in return, had shewn her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) choicest nursery of plants, and
actually presented her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) with a very curious specimen of heath.

<p/>On this _rencontre_ they all returned to the house together, there
to lounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, and
Quarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of
dinner. It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came
in, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially
agreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the
object of the day. By their own accounts they had been all walking after
each other, and the junction which had taken place at last seemed, to
Fanny's observation, to have been as much too late for re-establishing
harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth, that hers was not
the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was gloom on the face of
each. Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) thought
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was taking particular pains, during dinner, to do away any
little resentment of the other two, and restore general good-humour.

<p/>Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles' drive home
allowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to
table, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came
to the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained a
few pheasants' eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made
abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead the
way. At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope I
am not to lose my companion, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is afraid of the evening air
in so exposed a seat.''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>The request had not been foreseen, but was very
graciously received, and Julia's day was likely to end almost as well as
it began. Miss Bertram had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) mind to something different, and
was a little disappointed; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) conviction of being really the
one preferred comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) under it, and enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to receive Mr.
Rushworth's parting attentions as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) ought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was certainly better
pleased to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) into the barouche than to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) in ascending
the box, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Norris, as they drove through the park. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing but pleasure from
beginning to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your
aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go. A pretty good day's
amusement you have had!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria was just discontented enough to say directly, <div class="bookquote">``I think _you_ have
done pretty well yourself, ma’am. Your lap seems full of good things,
and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my
elbow unmercifully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old
gardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it in
my lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me; take
great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just like
the excellent one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that good old
Mrs. Whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses. I stood out as long
as I could, till the tears almost came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) eyes, and I knew it was
just the sort that my sister would be delighted with. That Mrs. Whitaker
is a treasure! She (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) was quite shocked when I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) whether wine was
allowed at the second table, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) has turned away two housemaids for
wearing white gowns. Take care of the cheese, Fanny. Now I can manage
the other parcel and the basket very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else have you been spunging?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, half-pleased that
Sotherton should be so complimented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spunging, my dear! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants'
eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) would not take
a denial. She (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) said it must be such an amusement to me, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) understood
I lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures of that sort; and
so to be sure it will. I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the
first spare hen, and if they come to good I can have them moved to my
own house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great delight to me in
my lonely hours to attend to them. And if I have good luck, your mother
shall have some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the drive was as
pleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it; but when Mrs. Norris
ceased speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within. Their
spirits were in general exhausted; and to determine whether the day had
afforded most pleasure or pain, might occupy the meditations of almost
all.



<p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>The day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections, afforded the Miss
Bertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the letters
from Antigua, which soon afterwards reached Mansfield. It was much
pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father; and to think
of their father in England again within a certain period, which these
letters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.

<p/>November was the black month fixed for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) return. Sir Thomas wrote of
it with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
business was so nearly concluded as to justify him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in proposing to take
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) passage in the September packet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) consequently looked forward
with the hope of being with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) beloved family again early in November.

<p/>Maria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) the father brought a
husband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) happiness
would unite her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to the lover, on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had chosen that happiness
should depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could do was to
throw a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) should
see something else. It would hardly be _early_ in November, there
were generally delays, a bad passage or _something_; that favouring
_something_ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or
their understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. It would
probably be the middle of November at least; the middle of November
was three months off. Three months comprised thirteen weeks. Much might
happen in thirteen weeks.

<p/>Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters felt on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) return, and would hardly have
found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the
breast of another young lady. Miss Crawford, on walking up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
brother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news; and
though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness, and
to have vented all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it with
an attention not so easily satisfied. Mrs. Norris gave the particulars
of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea, as Miss
Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking
out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr. Rushworth,
and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>)
suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``How
happy Mr. Rushworth looks! He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) is thinking of November.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father's return will be a very interesting event.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but
including so many dangers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your
sister's marriage, and your taking orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be affronted,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>), laughing, <div class="bookquote">``but it does put me in mind of
some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in
a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no sacrifice in the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>replied Edmund, with a serious
smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; <div class="bookquote">``it is entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own
doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has done no more than
what every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being
extremely happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria's
marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's convenience
should accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I
understand, hereabouts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which you suppose has biassed me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But _that_ I am sure it has not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would affirm
myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for
me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should. There
was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no reason why
a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will have a
competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I should not have
been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father was too
conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I was biased, but
I think it was blamelessly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the same sort of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, after a short pause, <div class="bookquote">``as for
the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be
in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody wonders that
they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best, or
suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either
navy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its favour:
heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are always
acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and
sailors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of
preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund. <div class="bookquote">``To be
justified in your eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must do it in the most complete uncertainty
of any provision.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed;
absolute madness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither to
take orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would not
know what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from
your own argument. As he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) cannot be influenced by those feelings which
you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in
their choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are
all against him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting
sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) is very sincere in preferring an income ready made,
to the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doing
nothing all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It is
indolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a want of
all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination
to take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen.
A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish--read the
newspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) wife. His (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) curate does
all the work, and the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) own life is to dine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so common
as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character. I
suspect that in this comprehensive and -LRB-may I say-RRB- commonplace censure,
you are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whose
opinions you have been in the habit of hearing. It is impossible that
your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy.
You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men
you condemn so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told at
your uncle's table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion
is general, it is usually correct. Though _I_ have not seen much of
the domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any
deficiency of information.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are
condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information,
or -LRB-smiling-RRB- of something else. Your uncle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) brother admirals,
perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad,
they were always wishing away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor William! He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the
Antwerp,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>was a tender apostrophe of Fanny's, very much to the purpose
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own feelings if not of the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``that I can hardly suppose--and since you push me so
hard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of seeing
what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my own
brother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to
me, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good scholar
and clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable,
_I_ see him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) to be an indolent, selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who must have
his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger for the
convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder,
is out of humour with his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) excellent wife. To own the truth, Henry and
I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a
green goose, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could not get the better of. My poor sister was
forced to stay and bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great
defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence;
and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to
such feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt to
defend Dr. Grant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>replied Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``but we need not give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) profession for all
that; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would have
taken a--not a good temper into it; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) must, either in the navy
or army, have had a great many more people under his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) command than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
has now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) as a sailor or
soldier than as a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that whatever
there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater
danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would have had less time and obligation--where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) might have escaped
that knowledge of himself, the _frequency_, at least, of that knowledge
which it is impossible he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) should escape as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) is now. A man--a sensible
man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty
every week, cannot go to church twice every Sunday, and preach such very
good sermons in so good a manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) does, without being the better
for it himself. It must make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) think; and I have no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had been
anything but a clergyman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better
fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness
depends upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own sermons; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may preach himself into a
good-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quarrelling
about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund
affectionately, <div class="bookquote">``must be beyond the reach of any sermons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time
to say, in a pleasant manner, <div class="bookquote">``I fancy Miss Price has been more used to
deserve praise than to hear it'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>; when, being earnestly invited by the
Miss Bertrams to join in a glee, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) tripped off to the instrument,
leaving Edmund looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) in an ecstasy of admiration of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>)
many virtues, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) obliging manners down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) light and graceful
tread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There goes good-humour, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) presently. <div class="bookquote">``There goes a
temper which would never give pain! How well she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) walks! and how readily
she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
is asked. What a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) added, after an instant's reflection, <div class="bookquote">``that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) should have been in such hands!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) continue at the
window with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in spite of the expected glee; and of having his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) eyes
soon turned, like hers, towards the scene without, where all that was
solemn, and soothing, and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an
unclouded night, and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods. Fanny
spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings. <div class="bookquote">``Here's harmony!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``here's repose! Here's
what may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only
can attempt to describe! Here's what may tranquillise every care, and
lift the heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, I
feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world;
and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature
were more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves by
contemplating such a scene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they
are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree,
as you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in
early life. They lose a great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_You_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a very apt scholar. There's Arcturus looking very bright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and the Bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least. It is a great while since we have had any
star-gazing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I do not know how it has happened.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The glee began. <div class="bookquote">``We will stay
till this is finished, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) back on the window;
and as it advanced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had the mortification of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) advance too,
moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when it
ceased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was close by the singers, among the most urgent in requesting
to hear the glee again.

<p/>Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris's
threats of catching cold.



<p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>Sir Thomas was to return in November, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eldest son had duties to
call him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) earlier home. The approach of September brought tidings of Mr.
Bertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter
to Edmund; and by the end of August he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) arrived himself, to be gay,
agreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford
demanded; to tell of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might have listened six weeks before with some interest, and
altogether to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the fullest conviction, by the power of actual
comparison, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) preferring his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) younger brother.

<p/>It was very vexatious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was heartily sorry for it; but so it was;
and so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not even want
to attract him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty
required: his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything but
pleasure in view, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own will to consult, made it perfectly clear
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not care about her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) indifference was so much more
than equalled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own, that were he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) now to step forth the owner of
Mansfield Park, the Sir Thomas complete, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was to be in time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
did not believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>).

<p/>The season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield took
Mr. Crawford into Norfolk. Everingham could not do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) in the
beginning of September. He (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) went for a fortnight--a fortnight of such
dullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their
guard, and made even Julia admit, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) jealousy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister, the
absolute necessity of distrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) attentions, and wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) not
to return; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals of
shooting and sleeping, to have convinced the gentleman that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ought
to keep longer away, had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) been more in the habit of examining his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own
motives, and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) idle vanity was
tending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would not look beyond the present moment. The sisters, handsome,
clever, and encouraging, were an amusement to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sated mind; and
finding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gladly returned to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed thither
quite as gladly by those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came to trifle with further.

<p/>Maria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and doomed to the
repeated details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) day's sport, good or bad, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) boast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) dogs,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) jealousy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) neighbours, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) doubts of their qualifications,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) zeal after poachers, subjects which will not find their way to
female feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on
the other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and Julia, unengaged and
unemployed, felt all the right of missing him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) much more. Each sister
believed herself the favourite. Julia might be justified in so doing by
the hints of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit what she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) wished, and Maria
by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself. Everything returned into the same
channel as before his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) absence; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) manners being to each so animated and
agreeable as to lose no ground with either, and just stopping short of
the consistence, the steadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which
might excite general notice.

<p/>Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike; but
since the day at Sotherton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could never see Mr. Crawford with either
sister without observation, and seldom without wonder or censure; and
had her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own judgment been equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) exercise of it
in every other respect, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) been sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was seeing clearly,
and judging candidly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would probably have made some important
communications to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) usual confidant. As it was, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only
hazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. <div class="bookquote">``I am rather surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon, after being here
so long before, full seven weeks; for I had understood he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was so
very fond of change and moving about, that I thought something would
certainly occur, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was once gone, to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) elsewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is
used to much gayer places than Mansfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) credit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>was Edmund's answer; <div class="bookquote">``and I dare say it gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)
sister pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not like his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) unsettled habits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a favourite he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) is with my cousins!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) manners to women are such as must please. Mrs. Grant, I
believe, suspects him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) of a preference for Julia; I have never seen much
symptom of it, but I wish it may be so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) has no faults but what a
serious attachment would remove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Miss Bertram were not engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny cautiously, <div class="bookquote">``I could
sometimes almost think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) more than Julia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) liking Julia best, than you,
Fanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, before
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has quite made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mind, will distinguish the sister or
intimate friend of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is really thinking of more than the
woman herself. Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found
himself in any danger from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>),
after such a proof as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has given that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) feelings are not strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have been mistaken, and meant to think
differently in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could
do, and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
occasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say that
Julia was Mr. Crawford's choice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) knew not always what to think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
was privy, one evening, to the hopes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) aunt Norris on the subject,
as well as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) feelings, and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth, on a
point of some similarity, and could not help wondering as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) listened;
and glad would she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) have been not to be obliged to listen, for it was
while all the other young people were dancing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) sitting,
most unwillingly, among the chaperons at the fire, longing for the
re-entrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) elder cousin, on whom all her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own hopes of a partner
then depended. It was Fanny's first ball, though without the preparation
or splendour of many a young lady's first ball, being the thought only
of the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of a violin player in
the servants' hall, and the possibility of raising five couple with
the help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr. Bertram's just
arrived on a visit. It had, however, been a very happy one to Fanny
through four dances, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was quite grieved to be losing even a
quarter of an hour. While waiting and wishing, looking now at
the dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the two
above-mentioned ladies was forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Norris, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) eyes directed towards Mr.
Rushworth and Maria, who were partners for the second time, <div class="bookquote">``we shall
see some happy faces again now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>partners</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other, with a stately simper, <div class="bookquote">``there
will be some satisfaction in looking on _now_, and I think it was rather
a pity they should have been obliged to part. Young folks in their
situation should be excused complying with the common forms. I wonder my
son did not propose it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did, ma’am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss. But dear Maria
has such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true delicacy
which one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth--that wish of
avoiding particularity! Dear ma’am, only look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) face at this
moment; how different from what it was the two last dances!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bertram did indeed look happy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) eyes were sparkling with
pleasure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was speaking with great animation, for Julia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
partner, Mr. Crawford, were close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>); they were all in a cluster
together. How she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had looked before, Fanny could not recollect, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had been dancing with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Norris continued, <div class="bookquote">``It is quite delightful, ma’am, to see young
people so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing! I
cannot but think of dear Sir Thomas's delight. And what do you say,
ma’am, to the chance of another match? Mr. Rushworth has set a good
example, and such things are very catching.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Rushworth, who saw nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) son, was quite at a loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The couple above, ma’am. Do you see no symptoms there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford. Yes, indeed, a very pretty match.
What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) property?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Four thousand a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they
have. Four thousand a year is a pretty estate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) seems a very
genteel, steady young man, so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not a settled thing, ma’am, yet. We only speak of it among
friends. But I have very little doubt it _will_ be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is growing
extremely particular in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attentions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny could listen no farther. Listening and wondering were all
suspended for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again; and though
feeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought it
must happen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) came towards their little circle; but instead of asking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to dance, drew a chair near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) an account of the
present state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom, from
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) had just parted. Fanny found that it was not to be, and in the
modesty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nature immediately felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been unreasonable
in expecting it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) had told of his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) took a newspaper from
the table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, <div class="bookquote">``If you want to
dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With more than equal civility
the offer was declined; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not wish to dance. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>), in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the newspaper again,
<div class="bookquote">``for I am tired to death. I only wonder how the good people can keep
it up so long. They had need be _all_ in love, to find any amusement in
such folly; and so they are, I fancy. If you look at them you may see
they are so many couple of lovers--all but Yates and Mrs. Grant--and,
between ourselves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), poor woman, must want a lover as much as any one
of them. A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>making
a sly face as he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) spoke towards the chair of the latter, who proving,
however, to be close at his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) elbow, made so instantaneous a change of
expression and subject necessary, as Fanny, in spite of everything,
could hardly help laughing at. <div class="bookquote">``A strange business this in America, Dr.
Grant! What is your opinion? I always come to you to know what I am to
think of public matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) aunt soon afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``as you are not dancing,
I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>Then leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) seat, and coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) to enforce the proposal,
added in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth, you
know. Your mother is quite anxious about it, but cannot very well spare
time to sit down herself, because of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fringe. Now, you and I and Dr.
Grant will just do; and though _we_ play but half-crowns, you know, you
may bet half-guineas with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be most happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) aloud, and jumping up with
alacrity, <div class="bookquote">``it would give me the greatest pleasure; but that I am
this moment going to dance.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Come, Fanny, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``do not be
dawdling any longer, or the dance will be over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to
feel much gratitude towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin, or distinguish, as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) certainly
did, between the selfishness of another person and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty modest request upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) indignantly exclaimed as they
walked away. <div class="bookquote">``To want to nail me to a card-table for the next two hours
with herself and Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that poking
old woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra. I wish my good
aunt would be a little less busy! And to ask me in such a way too!
without ceremony, before them all, so as to leave me no possibility
of refusing. _That_ is what I dislike most particularly. It raises my
spleen more than anything, to have the pretence of being asked, of
being given a choice, and at the same time addressed in such a way as
to oblige one to do the very thing, whatever it be! If I had not luckily
thought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it. It is
a great deal too bad. But when my aunt has got a fancy in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) head,
nothing can stop her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''



 (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIII

<p/>The Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much to recommend
him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being the younger son of
a lord with a tolerable independence; and Sir Thomas would probably
have thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable. Mr.
Bertram's acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had begun at Weymouth, where they had
spent ten days together in the same society, and the friendship, if
friendship it might be called, had been proved and perfected by Mr.
Yates's being invited to take Mansfield in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) way, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) could,
and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) promising to come; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) did come rather earlier than had
been expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up of a large party
assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend, which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had left
Weymouth to join. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) came on the wings of disappointment, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
head full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party; and the play
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had borne a part was within two days of representation,
when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the family
had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers. To be so near
happiness, so near fame, so near the long paragraph in praise of the
private theatricals at Ecclesford, the seat of the Right Hon. Lord
Ravenshaw, in Cornwall, which would of course have immortalised the
whole party for at least a twelvemonth! and being so near, to lose
it all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates could talk of
nothing else. Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements and
dresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) never-failing subject, and to
boast of the past his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) only consolation.

<p/>Happily for him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>), a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for acting
so strong among young people, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) could hardly out-talk the interest
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) hearers. From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue it
was all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to have been a
party concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill. The play
had been Lovers' Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel. <div class="bookquote">``A
trifling part,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and not at all to my taste, and such a one
as I certainly would not accept again; but I was determined to make no
difficulties. Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two
characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford; and though Lord
Ravenshaw offered to resign his (<font color='blue'><b>Ravenshaw</b></font>) to me, it was impossible to take it, you
know. I was sorry for _him (<font color='blue'><b>Ravenshaw</b></font>)_ that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ravenshaw</b></font>) should have so mistaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Ravenshaw</b></font>) powers,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Ravenshaw</b></font>) was no more equal to the Baron--a little man with a weak voice,
always hoarse after the first ten minutes. It must have injured the
piece materially; but _I_ was resolved to make no difficulties. Sir
Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick, but that was because
Sir Henry wanted the part himself; whereas it was certainly in the best
hands of the two. I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckily
the strength of the piece did not depend upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Our Agatha was
inimitable, and the duke was thought very great by many. And upon the
whole, it would certainly have gone off wonderfully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a hard case, upon my word'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; and, <div class="bookquote">``I do think you were very much
to be pitied,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were the kind responses of listening sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowager
could not have died at a worse time; and it is impossible to help
wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days
we wanted. It was but three days; and being only a grandmother, and all
happening two hundred miles off, I think there would have been no great
harm, and it was suggested, I know; but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose is
one of the most correct men in England, would not hear of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An afterpiece instead of a comedy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bertram. <div class="bookquote">``Lovers' Vows
were at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother
by themselves. Well, the jointure may comfort _him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)_; and perhaps,
between friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) began to tremble for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) credit and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lungs in the
Baron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make _you_ amends, Yates, I
think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield, and ask you to be our
manager.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This, though the thought of the moment, did not end with the moment; for
the inclination to act was awakened, and in no one more strongly than in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) who was now master of the house; and who, having so much leisure as
to make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise such a degree of
lively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to the novelty
of acting. The thought returned again and again. <div class="bookquote">``Oh for the Ecclesford
theatre and scenery to try something with.''  (<font color='red'><b>Each sister</b></font>)</div>Each sister could echo the
wish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) gratifications
it was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea. <div class="bookquote">``I really
believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake
any character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to
the singing hero of a farce in his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel
as if I could be anything or everything; as if I could rant and storm,
or sigh or cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy in the English language.
Let us be doing something. Be it only half a play, an act, a scene; what
should prevent us? Not these countenances, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>looking towards
the Miss Bertrams; <div class="bookquote">``and for a theatre, what signifies a theatre? We
shall be only amusing ourselves. Any room in this house might suffice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bertrams/Bertrams</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must have a curtain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Tom Bertram; <div class="bookquote">``a few yards of green baize
for a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, quite enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Yates/Yates</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Yates, <div class="bookquote">``with only just a side wing or two
run up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down; nothing
more would be necessary on such a plan as this. For mere amusement among
ourselves we should want nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Yates/Yates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe we must be satisfied with _less_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria. <div class="bookquote">``There would
not be time, and other difficulties would arise. We must rather adopt
Mr. Crawford's views, and make the _performance_, not the _theatre_, our
object. Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm. <div class="bookquote">``Let us do nothing
by halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted
up with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from
beginning to end; so as it be a German play, no matter what, with a good
tricking, shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe, and a
song between the acts. If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Edmund, do not be disagreeable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>said Julia. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody loves a play
better than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but I would hardly
walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who
have not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have
all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was
discussed with unabated eagerness, every one's inclination increasing
by the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; and
though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the
world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all,
the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to
make Edmund quite uncomfortable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was determined to prevent it, if
possible, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother, who equally heard the conversation which
passed at table, did not evince the least disapprobation.

<p/>The same evening afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) an opportunity of trying his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) strength.
Maria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates were in the billiard-room.
Tom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was
standing thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at
a little distance, and Fanny close beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) work, thus
began as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) entered--<div class="bookquote">``Such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours is not
to be met with, I believe, above ground. I can stand it no longer, and I
think, I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again; but one
good thing I have just ascertained: it is the very room for a theatre,
precisely the shape and length for it; and the doors at the farther
end, communicating with each other, as they may be made to do in five
minutes, by merely moving the bookcase in my father's room, is the very
thing we could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it; and
my father's room will be an excellent greenroom. It seems to join the
billiard-room on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, in a low
voice, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother approached the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not serious! never more so, I assure you. What is there to surprise you
in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it would be very wrong. In a _general_ light, private
theatricals are open to some objections, but as _we_ are circumstanced,
I must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudicious
to attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of feeling
on my father's account, absent as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is, and in some degree of constant
danger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose
situation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely
delicate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going to act three
times a week till my father's return, and invite all the country. But
it is not to be a display of that sort. We mean nothing but a little
amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our
powers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be
trusted, I think, in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable;
and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing
in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in
chattering in words of our own. I have no fears and no scruples. And
as to my father's being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I
consider it rather as a motive; for the expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) return must
be a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can be the means of
amusing that anxiety, and keeping up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spirits for the next few weeks,
I shall think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It
is a _very_ anxious period for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) said this, each looked towards their mother. Lady Bertram, sunk
back in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease,
and tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was
getting through the few difficulties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>Edmund smiled and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove! this won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Tom, throwing himself into a chair with
a hearty laugh. <div class="bookquote">``To be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety--I was unlucky
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ladyship, in the heavy tone of one
half-roused; <div class="bookquote">``I was not asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, no, ma’am, nobody suspected you! Well, Edmund,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) continued,
returning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as Lady
Bertram began to nod again, <div class="bookquote">``but _this_ I _will_ maintain, that we shall
be doing no harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father would totally
disapprove it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am convinced to the contrary. Nobody is fonder of the exercise
of talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and for
anything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has always a
decided taste. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) encouraged it in us as boys. How many a time
have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar, and to _be'd_ and
not _to_ _be'd_, in this very room, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) amusement? And I am sure,
_my_ _name_ _was_ _Norval_, every evening of my life through one
Christmas holidays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a very different thing. You must see the difference yourself. My
father wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would never
wish his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grown-up daughters to be acting plays. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sense of decorum is
strict.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Tom, displeased. <div class="bookquote">``I know my father as well as
you do; and I'll take care that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughters do nothing to distress
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I'll take care of the rest of
the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are resolved on acting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>replied the persevering Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``I must
hope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and I think a theatre
ought not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my father's
house in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) absence which could not be justified.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For everything of that nature I will be answerable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in a
decided tone. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great an
interest in being careful of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house as you can have; and as to such
alterations as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, or
unlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of a
week without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well suppose
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the
breakfast-room, than we did before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went away, or to my sister's
pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. Absolute
nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as an
expense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! Perhaps
it might cost a whole twenty pounds. Something of a theatre we must have
undoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and a
little carpenter's work, and that's all; and as the carpenter's work
may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be
too absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed,
everything will be right with Sir Thomas. Don't imagine that nobody in
this house can see or judge but yourself. Don't act yourself, if you do
not like it, but don't expect to govern everybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, as to acting myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``_that_ I absolutely protest
against.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom walked out of the room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said it, and Edmund was left to sit
down and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.

<p/>Fanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company in every feeling
throughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) anxiety to suggest
some comfort, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit
them. Your brother's taste and your sisters' seem very different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no hope there, Fanny. If they persist in the scheme, they will
find something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _them_,
and that is all I can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) would, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) has no influence with either Tom or my
sisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself,
I shall let things take their course, without attempting it through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do
anything than be altogether by the ears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sisters</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sisters, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had an opportunity of speaking the next morning,
were quite as impatient of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) advice, quite as unyielding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
representation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as Tom.
Their mother had no objection to the plan, and they were not in the
least afraid of their father's disapprobation. There could be no harm in
what had been done in so many respectable families, and by so many women
of the first consideration; and it must be scrupulousness run mad that
could see anything to censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending only
brothers and sisters and intimate friends, and which would never be
heard of beyond themselves. Julia _did_ seem inclined to admit that
Maria's situation might require particular caution and delicacy--but
that could not extend to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)_--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was at liberty; and Maria evidently
considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) engagement as only raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) so much more above
restraint, and leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) less occasion than Julia to consult either
father or mother. Edmund had little to hope, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was still urging the
subject when Henry Crawford entered the room, fresh from the Parsonage,
calling out, <div class="bookquote">``No want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram. No want
of understrappers: my sister desires her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) love, and hopes to be admitted
into the company, and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna
or tame confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, <div class="bookquote">``What say you now? Can we
be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>And Edmund, silenced,
was obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry
fascination to the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to
dwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than on
anything else.

<p/>The scheme advanced. Opposition was vain; and as to Mrs. Norris, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
was mistaken in supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) would wish to make any. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) started no
difficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) eldest
nephew and niece, who were all-powerful with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>); and as the whole
arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody, and none at all
to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle,
and importance, and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself
obliged to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own house, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had been living a month at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own cost, and take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) abode in theirs, that every hour might be
spent in their service, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was, in fact, exceedingly delighted with the
project.



<p/>CHAPTER XIV

<p/>Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed. The business
of finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle; and
the carpenter had received his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) orders and taken his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) measurements, had
suggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having made
the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident, was
already at work, while a play was still to seek. Other preparations
were also in hand. An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from
Northampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris -LRB-with a saving by her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) good
management of full three-quarters of a yard-RRB-, and was actually forming
into a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and
as two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to
hope that none might ever be found.

<p/>There were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people
to be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a
need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that there
did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and
zeal could hold out.

<p/>On the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford, and Mr.
Yates; on the comic, Tom Bertram, not _quite_ alone, because it was
evident that Mary Crawford's wishes, though politely kept back, inclined
the same way: but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) determinateness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) power seemed to make
allies unnecessary; and, independent of this great irreconcilable
difference, they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the
whole, but every character first-rate, and three principal women. All
the best plays were run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor
Othello, nor Douglas, nor The Gamester, presented anything that could
satisfy even the tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal,
Wheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera, were successively
dismissed with yet warmer objections. No piece could be proposed that
did not supply somebody with a difficulty, and on one side or the other
it was a continual repetition of, <div class="bookquote">``Oh no, _that_ will never do! Let us
have no ranting tragedies. Too many characters. Not a tolerable
woman's part in the play. Anything but _that_, my dear Tom. It would be
impossible to fill it up. One could not expect anybody to take such a
part. Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end. _That_ might do,
perhaps, but for the low parts. If I _must_ give my opinion, I have
always thought it the most insipid play in the English language. _I_ do
not wish to make objections; I shall be happy to be of any use, but I
think we could not chuse worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness
which, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wondering
how it would end. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own gratification she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have wished that
something might be acted, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never seen even half a play, but
everything of higher consequence was against it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This will never do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Tom Bertram at last. <div class="bookquote">``We are wasting time
most abominably. Something must be fixed on. No matter what, so that
something is chosen. We must not be so nice. A few characters too many
must not frighten us. We must _double_ them. We must descend a little.
If a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything of
it. From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you chuse
to give me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition for
nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For about the fifth time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) then proposed the Heir at Law, doubting only
whether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself; and very
earnestly, but very unsuccessfully, trying to persuade the others that
there were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the dramatis personae.

<p/>The pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same
speaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the
table, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``Lovers' Vows! And why
should not Lovers' Vows do for _us_ as well as for the Ravenshaws? How
came it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if it would do
exactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts for Yates
and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody else
wants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not dislike,
and, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do my best.
And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is only Count
Cassel and Anhalt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>The suggestion was generally welcome. Everybody was growing weary of
indecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had been
proposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was particularly
pleased: he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) had been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford,
had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw's, and been forced to re-rant
it all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ravenshaw</b></font>) own room. The storm through Baron Wildenheim was the
height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildenheim</b></font>) theatrical ambition; and with the advantage of knowing
half the scenes by heart already, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildenheim</b></font>) did now, with the greatest
alacrity, offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildenheim</b></font>) services for the part. To do him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildenheim</b></font>) justice, however,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildenheim</b></font>) did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering that there was
some very good ranting-ground in Frederick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) professed an equal
willingness for that. Henry Crawford was ready to take either. Whichever
Mr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>), and a short parley
of compliment ensued. Miss Bertram, feeling all the interest of an
Agatha in the question, took on her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) to decide it, by observing to Mr.
Yates that this was a point in which height and figure ought to
be considered, and that _his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)_ being the tallest, seemed to fit him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)
peculiarly for the Baron. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) was acknowledged to be quite right, and
the two parts being accepted accordingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) was certain of the proper
Frederick. Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr. Rushworth,
who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything; when
Julia, meaning, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister, to be Agatha, began to be scrupulous on
Miss Crawford's account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not behaving well by the absent,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Here are not women
enough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is nothing
for your sister, Mr. Crawford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was very sure
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister had no wish of acting but as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might be useful, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. But
this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of
Amelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
would accept it. <div class="bookquote">``It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters. It can be no
sacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each felt the
best claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) by the
rest. Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with
seeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled the
business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must entreat Miss _Julia_ Bertram,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``not to engage in the
part of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You must
not, indeed you must not''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>)-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``I could not stand your
countenance dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have had
together would infallibly come across me, and Frederick and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) knapsack
would be obliged to run away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in the
matter to Julia's feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) saw a glance at Maria which confirmed
the injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was slighted, Maria
was preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress
shewed how well it was understood; and before Julia could command
herself enough to speak, her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) brother gave his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) weight against her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) too,
by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the best Agatha.
Though Julia fancies she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) prefers tragedy, I would not trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) in it.
There is nothing of tragedy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) has not the look of it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
features are not tragic features, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) walks too quick, and speaks
too quick, and would not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) countenance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had better do the old
countrywoman: the Cottager's wife; you had, indeed, Julia. Cottager's
wife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The old lady relieves the
high-flown benevolence of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband with a good deal of spirit. You
shall be Cottager's wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cottager's wife!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Yates/Yates</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Yates. <div class="bookquote">``What are you talking of? The most
trivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not a
tolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do that! It is an insult
to propose it. At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it. We
all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else. A little more
justice, Mr. Manager, if you please. You do not deserve the office, if
you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company have really
acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to
Julia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager's
wife; and I am sure I set her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the example of moderation myself in being
satisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will have
more credit in making something of it; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is so desperately bent
against everything humorous, let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) take Cottager's speeches instead of
Cottager's wife's, and so change the parts all through; _he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>)_ is solemn
and pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference in the play,
and as for Cottager himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) has got his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) wife's speeches, _I_
would undertake him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) with all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all your partiality for Cottager's wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Henry Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``it
will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and we
must not suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) good-nature to be imposed on. We must not _allow_
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to accept the part. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must not be left to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own complaisance.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) talents will be wanted in Amelia. Amelia is a character more
difficult to be well represented than even Agatha. I consider Amelia
is the most difficult character in the whole piece. It requires great
powers, great nicety, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) playfulness and simplicity without
extravagance. I have seen good actresses fail in the part. Simplicity,
indeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession.
It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not. It requires a
gentlewoman--a Julia Bertram. You _will_ undertake it, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>turning
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) a little; but
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) hesitated what to say, her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) brother again interposed with Miss
Crawford's better claim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) would not like it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) would not do well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) is too tall and
robust. Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It is
fit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looks the part, and I
am persuaded will do it admirably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Without attending to this, Henry Crawford continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) supplication.
<div class="bookquote">``You must oblige us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``indeed you must. When you have studied
the character, I am sure you will feel it suit you. Tragedy may be your
choice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_. You
will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will
not refuse to visit me in prison? I think I see you coming in with your
basket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) voice was felt. Julia wavered; but was he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only
trying to soothe and pacify her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) overlook the previous
affront? She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) distrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). The slight had been most determined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
was, perhaps, but at treacherous play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) looked suspiciously
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister; Maria's countenance was to decide it: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) were vexed
and alarmed--but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Julia
well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
expense. With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance
when I come in with a basket of provisions--though one might have
supposed--but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) stopped--Henry Crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not
know what to say. Tom Bertram began again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Crawford must be Amelia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) will be an excellent Amelia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character,''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>cried Julia, with
angry quickness: <div class="bookquote">``I am _not_ to be Agatha, and I am sure I will do
nothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world the
most disgusting to me. I quite detest her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>). An odious, little, pert,
unnatural, impudent girl. I have always protested against comedy, and
this is comedy in its worst form.''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>And so saying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) walked hastily
out of the room, leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but exciting
small compassion in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of
the whole, and who could not think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as under the agitations of
_jealousy_ without great pity.

<p/>A short silence succeeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) leaving them; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother soon
returned to business and Lovers' Vows, and was eagerly looking over
the play, with Mr. Yates's help, to ascertain what scenery would be
necessary--while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an
under-voice, and the declaration with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) began of, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I
would give up the part to Julia most willingly, but that though I shall
probably do it very ill, I feel persuaded _she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)_ would do it worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was
doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for.

<p/>When this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed
by Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in
the room now beginning to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram's
resolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia
to Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.

<p/>The first use she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) solitude was to take up the volume which
had been left on the table, and begin to acquaint herself with the play
of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had heard so much. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) curiosity was all awake, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ran
through it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals of
astonishment, that it could be chosen in the present instance, that it
could be proposed and accepted in a private theatre! Agatha and Amelia
appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) in their different ways so totally improper for home
representation--the situation of one, and the language of the other,
so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could hardly
suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in; and
longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which
Edmund would certainly make.



<p/>CHAPTER XV

<p/>Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after Miss
Bertram's return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth arrived, and another
character was consequently cast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had the offer of Count Cassel
and Anhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse, and wanted Miss
Bertram to direct him (<font color='blue'><b>Cassel</b></font>); but upon being made to understand the different
style of the characters, and which was which, and recollecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cassel</b></font>)
had once seen the play in London, and had thought Anhalt a very stupid
fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) soon decided for the Count. Miss Bertram approved the
decision, for the less he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had to learn the better; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could
not sympathise in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act
together, nor wait very patiently while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was slowly turning over the
leaves with the hope of still discovering such a scene, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) very kindly
took his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) part in hand, and curtailed every speech that admitted being
shortened; besides pointing out the necessity of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) being very much
dressed, and chusing his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) colours. Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
finery very well, though affecting to despise it; and was too much
engaged with what his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own appearance would be to think of the others,
or draw any of those conclusions, or feel any of that displeasure which
Maria had been half prepared for.

<p/>Thus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,
knew anything of the matter; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) entered the drawing-room before
dinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and Mr.
Yates; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
the agreeable news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have got a play,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is to be Lovers' Vows; and I am to be
Count Cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin
cloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of a
shooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny's eyes followed Edmund, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart beat for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heard
this speech, and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) look, and felt what his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sensations must be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lovers' Vows!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div>in a tone of the greatest amazement, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) only reply
to Mr. Rushworth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) turned towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) brother and sisters as if
hardly doubting a contradiction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Yates/Yates</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Yates. <div class="bookquote">``After all our debatings and difficulties, we
find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing so
unexceptionable, as Lovers' Vows. The wonder is that it should not have
been thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we have
all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford; and it is so useful to
have anything of a model! We have cast almost every part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you do for women?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund gravely, and looking at
Maria.

<p/>Maria blushed in spite of herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I take the part
which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a bolder eye-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Miss
Crawford is to be Amelia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled
up, with _us_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great
vexation.

<p/>Mr. Rushworth followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) to say, <div class="bookquote">``I come in three times, and have
two-and-forty speeches. That's something, is not it? But I do not much
like the idea of being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a blue
dress and a pink satin cloak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund could not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called
out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and being
accompanied by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth,
Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot,
before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without reflecting
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) friends at Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria, tell _you_,
that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation, and that I
hope you will give it up. I cannot but suppose you _will_ when you have
read it carefully over. Read only the first act aloud to either your
mother or aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be necessary
to send you to your _father's_ judgment, I am convinced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We see things very differently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>cried Maria. <div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly
acquainted with the play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions,
and so forth, which will be made, of course, I can see nothing
objectionable in it; and _I_ am not the _only_ young woman you find who
thinks it very fit for private representation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) answer; <div class="bookquote">``but in this matter it is _you_ who
are to lead. _You_ must set the example. If others have blundered, it
is your place to put them right, and shew them what true delicacy is.
In all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of the
party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/>This picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) consequence had some effect, for no one loved better
to lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I am
much obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I still
think you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake to
harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind. _There_ would be the
greatest indecorum, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head? No; let your
conduct be the only harangue. Say that, on examining the part, you feel
yourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion and
confidence than you can be supposed to have. Say this with firmness, and
it will be quite enough. All who can distinguish will understand your
motive. The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as it
ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not act anything improper, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram. <div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas
would not like it.--Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.--To be
sure, Julia is dressed by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am convinced, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, preventing Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``that Sir Thomas
would not like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were to decline the part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, with renewed zeal, <div class="bookquote">``Julia
would certainly take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) knew your reasons!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) might think the difference between us--the difference in our
situations--that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)_ need not be so scrupulous as _I_ might feel
necessary. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) would argue so. No; you must excuse me; I
cannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be so
disappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we
shall never act anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just going to say the very same thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Norris.
<div class="bookquote">``If every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the
preparations will be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure _that_
would be a discredit to us all. I do not know the play; but, as Maria
says, if there is anything a little too warm -LRB-and it is so with most of
them-RRB- it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise, Edmund. As
Mr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only wish Tom had
known his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own mind when the carpenters began, for there was the loss
of half a day's work about those side-doors. The curtain will be a good
job, however. The maids do their work very well, and I think we shall be
able to send back some dozens of the rings. There is no occasion to put
them so very close together. I _am_ of some use, I hope, in preventing
waste and making the most of things. There should always be one
steady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot to tell Tom of
something that happened to me this very day. I had been looking about me
in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who should I see but
Dick Jackson making up to the servants' hall-door with two bits of deal
board in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) hand, bringing them to father, you may be sure; mother had
chanced to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) of a message to father, and then father had bid
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bring up them two bits of board, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not no how do without
them. I knew what all this meant, for the servants' dinner-bell
was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I hate such
encroaching people -LRB-the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have always
said so: just the sort of people to get all they can-RRB-, I said to the boy
directly -LRB-a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know, who ought
to be ashamed of himself-RRB-, `_I'll_ take the boards to your father, Dick,
so get you home again as fast as you can.' The boy looked very silly,
and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I might speak
pretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) of coming marauding about
the house for one while. I hate such greediness--so good as your father
is to the family, employing the man all the year round!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; and
Edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) only
satisfaction.

<p/>Dinner passed heavily. Mrs. Norris related again her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) triumph over Dick
Jackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked
of, for Edmund's disapprobation was felt even by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would not have owned it. Maria, wanting Henry Crawford's animating
support, thought the subject better avoided. Mr. Yates, who was trying
to make himself agreeable to Julia, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) gloom less impenetrable on
any topic than that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) regret at her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) secession from their company;
and Mr. Rushworth, having only his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own part and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own dress in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
head, had soon talked away all that could be said of either.

<p/>But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:
there was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening
giving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being
reassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a
separate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting
deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the
entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it
was, could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful
joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how do you go on?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``What have you settled?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Oh! we
can do nothing without you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>followed the first salutations; and Henry
Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
sister made her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention was
complimenting _her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)_. <div class="bookquote">``I must really congratulate your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``on the play being chosen; for though you have borne it with
exemplary patience, I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and
difficulties. The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be
infinitely more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give you
joy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else who is in the
same predicament,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>glancing half fearfully, half slyly, beyond Fanny to
Edmund.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram, but Edmund said nothing.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) being only a bystander was not disclaimed. After continuing in chat
with the party round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returned
to the party round the table; and standing by them, seemed to
interest herself in their arrangements till, as if struck by a sudden
recollection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``My good friends, you are most composedly
at work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let
me know my fate in the meanwhile. Who is to be Anhalt? What gentleman
among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the same
melancholy truth, that they had not yet got any Anhalt. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Rushworth
was to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had my choice of the parts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Rushworth; <div class="bookquote">``but I thought I
should like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am
to have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You chose very wisely, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Crawford, with a
brightened look; <div class="bookquote">``Anhalt is a heavy part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Rushworth,
<div class="bookquote">``which is no trifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, after a short pause,
<div class="bookquote">``at this want of an Anhalt. Amelia deserves no better. Such a forward
young lady may well frighten the men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be but too happy in taking the part, if it were possible,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Tom; <div class="bookquote">``but, unluckily, the Butler and Anhalt are in together. I
will not entirely give it up, however; I will try what can be done--I
will look it over again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your _brother_ should take the part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Yates/Yates</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Yates, in a low voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Do not you think he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ shall not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>replied Tom, in a cold, determined manner.

<p/>Miss Crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards rejoined the
party at the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They do not want me at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), seating herself. <div class="bookquote">``I only puzzle
them, and oblige them to make civil speeches. Mr. Edmund Bertram, as
you do not act yourself, you will be a disinterested adviser; and,
therefore, I apply to _you_. What shall we do for an Anhalt? Is it
practicable for any of the others to double it? What is your advice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) calmly, <div class="bookquote">``is that you change the play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_I_ should have no objection,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``for though I should not
particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported, that is, if
everything went well, I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but
as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _that_ _table_''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-looking
round-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``it certainly will not be taken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund said no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If _any_ part could tempt _you_ to act, I suppose it would be Anhalt,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>observed the lady archly, after a short pause; <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a clergyman,
you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_That_ circumstance would by no means tempt me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``for I
should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting. It
must be very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn
lecturer; and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one
of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment and
mortification, moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) chair considerably nearer the tea-table, and
gave all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attention to Mrs. Norris, who was presiding there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Tom Bertram, from the other table, where the conference
was eagerly carrying on, and the conversation incessant, <div class="bookquote">``we want your
services.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was up in a moment, expecting some errand; for the habit of
employing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in that way was not yet overcome, in spite of all that
Edmund could do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat. We do not want your
_present_ services. We shall only want you in our play. You must be
Cottager's wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look.
<div class="bookquote">``Indeed you must excuse me. I could not act anything if you were to give
me the world. No, indeed, I cannot act.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you. It need not frighten
you: it is a nothing of a part, a mere nothing, not above half a dozen
speeches altogether, and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word
you say; so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must have you
to look at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Rushworth, <div class="bookquote">``what
would you do with such a part as mine? I have forty-two to learn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, shocked
to find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to feel
that almost every eye was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but I really cannot act.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, you can act well enough for _us_. Learn your part, and we
will teach you all the rest. You have only two scenes, and as I shall
be Cottager, I'll put you in and push you about, and you will do it very
well, I'll answer for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me. You cannot have an idea.
It would be absolutely impossible for me. If I were to undertake it, I
should only disappoint you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoo! Phoo! Do not be so shamefaced. You'll do it very well. Every
allowance will be made for you. We do not expect perfection. You must
get a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make
you a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your
eyes, and you will be a very proper, little old woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, growing
more and more red from excessive agitation, and looking distressfully
at Edmund, who was kindly observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); but unwilling to exasperate
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother by interference, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only an encouraging smile. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
entreaty had no effect on Tom: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only said again what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had said
before; and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed by
Maria, and Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which differed
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and which
altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could breathe
after it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) in a
whisper at once angry and audible--<div class="bookquote">``What a piece of work here is about
nothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a difficulty of
obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort--so kind as they are to
you! Take the part with a good grace, and let us hear no more of the
matter, I entreat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund. <div class="bookquote">``It is not fair to urge her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
in this manner. You see she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) does not like to act. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) chuse for
herself, as well as the rest of us. Her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) judgment may be quite as safely
trusted. Do not urge her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to urge her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Norris sharply; <div class="bookquote">``but I shall
think her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) does not do what her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
aunt and cousins wish her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)--very ungrateful, indeed, considering who and
what she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment
with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears were
beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, <div class="bookquote">``I
do not like my situation: this _place_ is too hot for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>and moved
away her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) chair to the opposite side of the table, close to Fanny, saying
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in a kind, low whisper, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) placed herself, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind,
my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is cross and
teasing, but do not let us mind them'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and with pointed attention
continued to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and endeavour to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits, in spite of
being out of spirits herself. By a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) prevented any
farther entreaty from the theatrical board, and the really good feelings
by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to
all the little she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had lost in Edmund's favour.

<p/>Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt very much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) work,
and wishing _she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and
supposing Fanny was now preparing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _appearance_, as of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
would come out when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded to
inquire if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had heard lately from her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother at sea, and said that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had quite a curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a very fine young
man, and advised Fanny to get his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) picture drawn before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went to sea
again--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery, or
help listening, and answering with more animation than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had intended.

<p/>The consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss Crawford's
attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram's telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
with infinite regret, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) found it absolutely impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to
undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) had been most
anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not do;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) must give it up. <div class="bookquote">``But there will not be the smallest difficulty in
filling it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``We have but to speak the word; we may pick and
chuse. I could name, at this moment, at least six young men within six
miles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company, and there are
one or two that would not disgrace us: I should not be afraid to trust
either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox. Tom Oliver is a very clever
fellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see
anywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride over
to Stoke, and settle with one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full
expectation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this:
so contrary to all their first protestations; but Edmund said nothing.
After a moment's thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied, <div class="bookquote">``As far as I
am concerned, I can have no objection to anything that you all think
eligible. Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen? Yes, Mr. Charles
Maddox dined at my sister's one day, did not he (<font color='blue'><b>Maddox</b></font>), Henry? A quiet-looking
young man. I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Let _him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ be applied to, if you please, for
it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles Maddox was to be the man. Tom repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) resolution of going
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) early on the morrow; and though Julia, who had scarcely opened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glance
first at Maria and then at Edmund, that <div class="bookquote">``the Mansfield theatricals would
enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>Edmund still held his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
peace, and shewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) feelings only by a determined gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not very sanguine as to our play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, in an
undervoice to Fanny, after some consideration; <div class="bookquote">``and I can tell Mr.
Maddox that I shall shorten some of _his (<font color='blue'><b>Maddox</b></font>)_ speeches, and a great many of
_my_ _own_, before we rehearse together. It will be very disagreeable,
and by no means what I expected.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVI

<p/>It was not in Miss Crawford's power to talk Fanny into any real
forgetfulness of what had passed. When the evening was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went to
bed full of it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits
sinking under her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's unkind reflection and reproach. To be called
into notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the prelude to
something so infinitely worse, to be told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must do what was
so impossible as to act; and then to have the charge of obstinacy and
ingratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the dependence
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) situation, had been too distressing at the time to make the
remembrance when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was alone much less so, especially with the
superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation of the
subject. Miss Crawford had protected her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only for the time; and if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative
urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund perhaps away,
what should she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) fell asleep before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could answer the
question, and found it quite as puzzling when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) awoke the next
morning. The little white attic, which had continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sleeping-room
ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) first entering the family, proving incompetent to suggest
any reply, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had recourse, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was dressed, to another
apartment more spacious and more meet for walking about in and thinking,
and of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had now for some time been almost equally mistress. It
had been their school-room; so called till the Miss Bertrams would not
allow it to be called so any longer, and inhabited as such to a later
period. There Miss Lee had lived, and there they had read and written,
and talked and laughed, till within the last three years, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) had
quitted them. The room had then become useless, and for some time was
quite deserted, except by Fanny, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) plants, or wanted
one of the books, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was still glad to keep there, from the
deficiency of space and accommodation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) little chamber above: but
gradually, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) value for the comforts of it increased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had added
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) possessions, and spent more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time there; and having nothing
to oppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it,
that it was now generally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it had
been called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered
Fanny's, almost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the
one making the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss
Bertrams, with every superiority in their own apartments which their own
sense of superiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs.
Norris, having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny's
account, was tolerably resigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) having the use of what nobody
else wanted, though the terms in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sometimes spoke of the
indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.

<p/>The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable
in many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind
as Fanny's; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped not to be
driven from it entirely, even when winter came. The comfort of it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hours of leisure was extreme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could go there after anything
unpleasant below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, or
some train of thought at hand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) plants, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) books--of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
been a collector from the first hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) commanding a shilling--her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
writing-desk, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) works of charity and ingenuity, were all within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would
do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an
interesting remembrance connected with it. Everything was a friend, or
bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much
of suffering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); though her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) motives had often been misunderstood,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings disregarded, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) comprehension undervalued; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost
every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
Bertram had spoken for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what
was yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) champion and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
friend: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cause or explained her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) meaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not to cry, or had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) some proof of affection which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together, so
harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm. The
room was most dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not have changed its furniture
for the handsomest in the house, though what had been originally plain
had suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its greatest elegancies
and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia's work, too ill done
for the drawing-room, three transparencies, made in a rage for
transparencies, for the three lower panes of one window, where Tintern
Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in
Cumberland, a collection of family profiles, thought unworthy of being
anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their side, and pinned
against the wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the
Mediterranean by William, with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom, in letters
as tall as the mainmast.

<p/>To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on
an agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at Edmund's profile
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could catch any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) counsel, or by giving air to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) geraniums
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had more
than fears of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own perseverance to remove: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had begun to feel
undecided as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _ought_ _to_ _do_; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walked round the
room her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doubts were increasing. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _right_ in refusing what was
so warmly asked, so strongly wished for--what might be so essential to a
scheme on which some of those to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) owed the greatest complaisance
had set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness, and a fear of
exposing herself? And would Edmund's judgment, would his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) persuasion of
Sir Thomas's disapprobation of the whole, be enough to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in a
determined denial in spite of all the rest? It would be so horrible to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to act that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
own scruples; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), the claims of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins
to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present upon present
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had received from them. The table between the windows was
covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at
different times, principally by Tom; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) grew bewildered as to the
amount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced. A tap at
the door roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in the midst of this attempt to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
duty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gentle <div class="bookquote">``Come in''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>was answered by the appearance of one,
before whom all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doubts were wont to be laid. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes brightened at
the sight of Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to consult. I want your opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My opinion!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, shrinking from such a compliment, highly as it
gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, your advice and opinion. I do not know what to do. This acting
scheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad a
play as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask
the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the
end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first.
I know no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which
must spring from his (<font color='blue'><b>Maddox</b></font>) being admitted among us in this manner is highly
objectionable, the _more_ than intimacy--the familiarity. I cannot
think of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such
magnitude as must, _if_ _possible_, be prevented. Do not you see it in
the same light?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but what can be done? Your brother is so determined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is but _one_ thing to be done, Fanny. I must take Anhalt myself.
I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny could not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not at all what I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``No man can like being
driven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency. After being known to
oppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face of
my joining them _now_, when they are exceeding their first plan in every
respect; but I can think of no other alternative. Can you, Fanny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny slowly, <div class="bookquote">``not immediately, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what? I see your judgment is not with me. Think it a little over.
Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that _may_, of
the unpleasantness that _must_ arise from a young man's being received
in this manner: domesticated among us; authorised to come at all hours,
and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints. To
think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create. It
is all very bad! Put yourself in Miss Crawford's place, Fanny. Consider
what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) has a right to be
felt for, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) evidently feels for herself. I heard enough of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) said to you last night to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) unwillingness to be
acting with a stranger; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) probably engaged in the part with
different expectations--perhaps without considering the subject enough
to know what was likely to be--it would be ungenerous, it would be
really wrong to expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) to it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) feelings ought to be respected.
Does it not strike you so, Fanny? You hesitate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in
to do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think
will be disagreeable to my uncle. It will be such a triumph to the
others!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously I
act. But, however, triumph there certainly will be, and I must brave it.
But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business,
of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall be
well repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can do nothing: I have
offended them, and they will not hear me; but when I have put them in
good-humour by this concession, I am not without hopes of persuading
them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than
they are now in the high road for. This will be a material gain. My
object is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants. Will not this
be worth gaining?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it will be a great point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But still it has not your approbation. Can you mention any other
measure by which I have a chance of doing equal good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I cannot think of anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me your approbation, then, Fanny. I am not comfortable without
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, cousin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are against me, I ought to distrust myself, and yet--But it is
absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way, riding about the
country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act--no matter whom:
the look of a gentleman is to be enough. I thought _you_ would have
entered more into Miss Crawford's feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) will be very glad. It must be a great relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said
Fanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) never appeared more amiable than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) behaviour to you last
night. It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) a very strong claim on my goodwill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) _was_ very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spared'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>...

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not finish the generous effusion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conscience stopt her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in
the middle, but Edmund was satisfied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall walk down immediately after breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and am sure
of giving pleasure there. And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you
any longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I had
spoken to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head has
been full of this matter all night. It is an evil, but I am certainly
making it less than it might be. If Tom is up, I shall go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
directly and get it over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all
in high good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with
such unanimity. _You_, in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip into
China, I suppose. How does Lord Macartney go on?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--opening a volume on
the table and then taking up some others. <div class="bookquote">``And here are Crabbe's Tales,
and the Idler, at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book. I
admire your little establishment exceedingly; and as soon as I am
gone, you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit
comfortably down to your table. But do not stay here to be cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure for Fanny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the most extraordinary, the most inconceivable, the most
unwelcome news; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could think of nothing else. To be acting! After
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) objections--objections so just and so public! After all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) say, and seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) look, and known him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to be feeling. Could
it be possible? Edmund so inconsistent! Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) not deceiving himself?
Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) not wrong? Alas! it was all Miss Crawford's doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) influence in every speech, and was miserable. The doubts and alarms
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own conduct, which had previously distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and
which had all slept while she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), were become of little
consequence now. This deeper anxiety swallowed them up. Things should
take their course; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cared not how it ended. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cousins might attack,
but could hardly tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was beyond their reach; and if at last
obliged to yield--no matter--it was all misery now.



<p/>CHAPTER XVII

<p/>It was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria. Such a
victory over Edmund's discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was
most delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in their
darling project, and they congratulated each other in private on the
jealous weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee
of feelings gratified in every way. Edmund might still look grave, and
say he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play
in particular; their point was gained: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was to act, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was driven
to it by the force of selfish inclinations only. Edmund had descended
from that moral elevation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had maintained before, and they were
both as much the better as the happier for the descent.

<p/>They behaved very well, however, to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ on the occasion, betraying no
exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemed
to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles
Maddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Maddox</b></font>) against their
inclination. <div class="bookquote">``To have it quite in their own family circle was what
they had particularly wished. A stranger among them would have been the
destruction of all their comfort'' (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea,
gave a hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were
ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It was
all good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
dress, Mr. Yates assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) that Anhalt's last scene with the Baron
admitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth undertook
to count his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) speeches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now.
Perhaps you may persuade _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is quite determined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) certainly will not act.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herself
again in danger, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) indifference to the danger was beginning to
fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) already.

<p/>There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this
change in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered
with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole
affair as could have but one effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was certainly right in
respecting such feelings; he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had determined on it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the
morning wore away in satisfactions very sweet, if not very sound. One
advantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss
Crawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) usual good-humour, agreed to
undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all
that occurred to gladden _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ heart during the day; and even this, when
imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss Crawford to
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was obliged--it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to
excite her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) gratitude, and whose merit in making them was spoken of
with a glow of admiration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was safe; but peace and safety were
unconnected here. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind had been never farther from peace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could
not feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had done wrong herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was disquieted
in every other way. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) judgment were equally against
Edmund's decision: she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not acquit his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) unsteadiness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
happiness under it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wretched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was full of jealousy and
agitation. Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an
insult, with friendly expressions towards herself which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could hardly
answer calmly. Everybody around her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was gay and busy, prosperous and
important; each had their object of interest, their part, their dress,
their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all were finding
employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in the playful
conceits they suggested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) alone was sad and insignificant: she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
no share in anything; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might go or stay; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might be in the midst
of their noise, or retreat from it to the solitude of the East room,
without being seen or missed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could almost think anything would
have been preferable to this. Mrs. Grant was of consequence: _her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_
good-nature had honourable mention; her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) taste and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) time were
considered; her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) presence was wanted; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was sought for, and attended,
and praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the
character she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had accepted. But reflection brought better feelings, and
shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect, which could never
have belonged to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_; and that, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) received even the greatest,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could never have been easy in joining a scheme which, considering
only her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) uncle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) must condemn altogether.

<p/>Fanny's heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) soon began to acknowledge to herself. Julia was a sufferer too,
though not quite so blamelessly.

<p/>Henry Crawford had trifled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) feelings; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had very long
allowed and even sought his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attentions, with a jealousy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister so
reasonable as ought to have been their cure; and now that the conviction
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) preference for Maria had been forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) submitted to it
without any alarm for Maria's situation, or any endeavour at rational
tranquillity for herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) either sat in gloomy silence, wrapt in
such gravity as nothing could subdue, no curiosity touch, no wit amuse;
or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates, was talking with forced gaiety
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) alone, and ridiculing the acting of the others.

<p/>For a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford had
endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and
compliment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had not cared enough about it to persevere against a
few repulses; and becoming soon too busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) play to have time for
more than one flirtation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather
thought it a lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might
ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was not
pleased to see Julia excluded from the play, and sitting by disregarded;
but as it was not a matter which really involved her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) happiness, as Henry
must be the best judge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), with a
most persuasive smile, that neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nor Julia had ever had a serious
thought of each other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) could only renew her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) former caution as to
the elder sister, entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) not to risk his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tranquillity by too
much admiration there, and then gladly take her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) share in anything that
brought cheerfulness to the young people in general, and that did so
particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) observation
to Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Mary coldly. <div class="bookquote">``I imagine both sisters are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both! no, no, that must not be. Do not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) a hint of it. Think of
Mr. Rushworth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth. It may
do _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_ some good. I often think of Mr. Rushworth's property and
independence, and wish them in other hands; but I never think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). A
man might represent the county with such an estate; a man might escape a
profession and represent the county.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _will_ be in parliament soon. When Sir Thomas comes, I
dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) will be in for some borough, but there has been nobody to
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in the way of doing anything yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) comes home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>said
Mary, after a pause. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember Hawkins Browne's `Address to
Tobacco,' in imitation of Pope?--

<p/>Blest leaf! whose aromatic gales dispense
To Templars modesty, to Parsons sense.

<p/>I will parody them--

<p/>Blest Knight! whose dictatorial looks dispense
To Children affluence, to Rushworth sense.

<p/>Will not that do, Mrs. Grant? Everything seems to depend upon Sir
Thomas's return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will find his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) consequence very just and reasonable when you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, I assure you. I do not think we do so well without him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) has a fine dignified manner, which suits the head of such a house,
and keeps everybody in their place. Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher
now than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) is at home; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in
order. But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry. I
am sure _Julia_ does not, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) would not have flirted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) did last
night with Mr. Yates; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) and Maria are very good friends, I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth's chance if Henry stept in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as
the play is all over, we will talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seriously and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) know

is Henry, for a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div><p/>Julia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned it not, and
though it escaped the notice of many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) own family likewise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had
loved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) did love still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had all the suffering which a warm
temper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment
of a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense of ill-usage.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heart was sore and angry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was capable only of angry
consolations. The sister with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was used to be on easy terms was
now become her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) greatest enemy: they were alienated from each other;
and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the
attentions which were still carrying on there, some punishment to
Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr.
Rushworth. With no material fault of temper, or difference of opinion,
to prevent their being very good friends while their interests were
the same, the sisters, under such a trial as this, had not affection or
principle enough to make them merciful or just, to give them honour or
compassion. Maria felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) triumph, and pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) purpose, careless of
Julia; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawford
without trusting that it would create jealousy, and bring a public
disturbance at last.

<p/>Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia; but there was no outward
fellowship between them. Julia made no communication, and Fanny took
no liberties. They were two solitary sufferers, or connected only by
Fanny's consciousness.

<p/>The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia's
discomposure, and their blindness to its true cause, must be imputed to
the fullness of their own minds. They were totally preoccupied. Tom was
engrossed by the concerns of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) theatre, and saw nothing that did not
immediately relate to it. Edmund, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) theatrical and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) real
part, between Miss Crawford's claims and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own conduct, between love
and consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy
in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company,
superintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for
which nobody thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), and saving, with delighted integrity, half
a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for
watching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters.



<p/>CHAPTER XVIII

<p/>Everything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and
dresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great impediments
arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was not all
uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not to
witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost
too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at first. Everybody began to have their vexation.
Edmund had many. Entirely against _his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ judgment, a scene-painter
arrived from town, and was at work, much to the increase of the
expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their proceedings; and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother, instead of being really guided by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) as to the privacy of
the representation, was giving an invitation to every family who came
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) way. Tom himself began to fret over the scene-painter's slow
progress, and to feel the miseries of waiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
part--all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) parts, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took every trifling one that could be united
with the Butler, and began to be impatient to be acting; and every day
thus unemployed was tending to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) sense of the insignificance
of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) parts together, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) more ready to regret that some
other play had not been chosen.

<p/>Fanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often the only
listener at hand, came in for the complaints and the distresses of
most of them. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant
dreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; that
Tom Bertram spoke so quick he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant
spoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
part, and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth,
who was wanting a prompter through every speech. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) knew, also, that
poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>): _his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)_
complaint came before her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) as well as the rest; and so decided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
eye was her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) cousin Maria's avoidance of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and so needlessly often the
rehearsal of the first scene between her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and Mr. Crawford, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had
soon all the terror of other complaints from _him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_. So far from being
all satisfied and all enjoying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found everybody requiring something
they had not, and giving occasion of discontent to the others. Everybody
had a part either too long or too short; nobody would attend as they
ought; nobody would remember on which side they were to come in; nobody
but the complainer would observe any directions.

<p/>Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the
play as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure to
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the first
act, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria.
Maria, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) also thought, acted well, too well; and after the first
rehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience; and sometimes
as prompter, sometimes as spectator, was often very useful. As far as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom, more talent and
taste than Mr. Yates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) as a man, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must admit
him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) to be the best actor, and on this point there were not many who
differed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) tameness and
insipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr. Rushworth turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
with a black look, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think there is anything so very
fine in all this? For the life and soul of me, I cannot admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>); and,
between ourselves, to see such an undersized, little, mean-looking man,
set up for a fine actor, is very ridiculous in my opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/>From this moment there was a return of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) former jealousy, which Maria,
from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to remove; and
the chances of Mr. Rushworth's ever attaining to the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
two-and-forty speeches became much less. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) ever making anything
_tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that except
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) mother; _she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)_, indeed, regretted that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) part was not more
considerable, and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they were
forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) scenes; but the
others aspired at nothing beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) remembering the catchword, and the
first line of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) speech, and being able to follow the prompter through
the rest. Fanny, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pity and kindheartedness, was at great pains to
teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) how to learn, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) all the helps and directions in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
power, trying to make an artificial memory for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), and learning every
word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) part herself, but without his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) being much the forwarder.

<p/>Many uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) certainly had;
but with all these, and other claims on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time and attention, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
as far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them,
as without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from having no
demand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) leisure as on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) compassion. The gloom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first
anticipations was proved to have been unfounded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was occasionally
useful to all; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was perhaps as much at peace as any.

<p/>There was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
help was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) quite as well off
as the rest, was evident by the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) claimed it--<div class="bookquote">``Come,
Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``these are fine times for you, but you must not be
always walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on at
your ease, in this way; I want you here. I have been slaving myself till
I can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth's cloak without sending
for any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help in putting
it together. There are but three seams; you may do them in a trice. It
would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do.
_You_ are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than _you_,
we should not get on very fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny took the work very quietly, without attempting any defence; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) kinder aunt Bertram observed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) behalf--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted: it is
all new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), you know; you and I used to be very fond of a play
ourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at
leisure, _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too. What is the play
about, Fanny? you have never told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! sister, pray do not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) now; for Fanny is not one of those who
can talk and work at the same time. It is about Lovers' Vows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram, <div class="bookquote">``there will be three acts
rehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of
seeing all the actors at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better stay till the curtain is hung,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Norris;
<div class="bookquote">``the curtain will be hung in a day or two--there is very little sense in
a play without a curtain--and I am much mistaken if you do not find it
draw up into very handsome festoons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting. Fanny did not share her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
aunt's composure: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the
three acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting
together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene between
them which interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) most particularly, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was longing
and dreading to see how they would perform. The whole subject of it was
love--a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman, and very
little short of a declaration of love be made by the lady.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had read and read the scene again with many painful, many wondering
emotions, and looked forward to their representation of it as a
circumstance almost too interesting. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not _believe_ they had yet
rehearsed it, even in private.

<p/>The morrow came, the plan for the evening continued, and Fanny's
consideration of it did not become less agitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) worked very
diligently under her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's directions, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) diligence and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
silence concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) escape with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) work to the East room, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have no
concern in another, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) deemed it, most unnecessary rehearsal of
the first act, which Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous at
once of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr.
Rushworth. A glimpse, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) passed through the hall, of the two ladies
walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wish of retreat, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a quarter of
an hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of
Miss Crawford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I right? Yes; this is the East room. My dear Miss Price, I beg your
pardon, but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the room
by her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) civilities, and looked at the bright bars of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) empty grate with
concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; I am quite warm, very warm. Allow me to stay here a little
while, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act. I have brought
my book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be _so_
obliged! I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund--by
ourselves--against the evening, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is not in the way; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
_were_, I do not think I could go through it with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_, till I have
hardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two. You will
be so good, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was most civil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) assurances, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not give them
in a very steady voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>continued Miss
Crawford, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) book. <div class="bookquote">``Here it is. I did not think much of it at
first--but, upon my word. There, look at _that_ speech, and _that_, and
_that_. How am I ever to look him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in the face and say such things? Could
you do it? But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is your cousin, which makes all the difference.
You must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy _you_ him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and get on by
degrees. You _have_ a look of _his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I? I will do my best with the greatest readiness; but I must
_read_ the part, for I can say very little of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_None_ of it, I suppose. You are to have the book, of course. Now for
it. We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the
front of the stage. There--very good school-room chairs, not made for a
theatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick
their feet against when they are learning a lesson. What would your
governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose? Could
Sir Thomas look in upon us just now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would bless himself, for we
are rehearsing all over the house. Yates is storming away in the
dining-room. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) as I came upstairs, and the theatre is engaged
of course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick. If
_they_ are not perfect, I _shall_ be surprised. By the bye, I looked in
upon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the
times when they were trying _not_ to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was with
me. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) began to look a little queer, so I turned it off as
well as I could, by whispering to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), `We shall have an excellent
Agatha; there is something so _maternal_ in her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) manner, so completely
_maternal_ in her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) voice and countenance.' Was not that well done of me?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) brightened up directly. Now for my soliloquy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the
idea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire; but
with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of
a man. With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;
and they had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought
a pause, and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.

<p/>Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the three
on this unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the very same
business that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure were
likely to be more than momentary in _them_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) too had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) book, and was
seeking Fanny, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to rehearse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to prepare
for the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house;
and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together, of
comparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny's kind offices.

<p/>_She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ could not equal them in their warmth. _Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ spirits sank under the
glow of theirs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to
both to have any comfort in having been sought by either. They must now
rehearse together. Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,
not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was
wanted only to prompt and observe them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was invested, indeed, with
the office of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it and
tell them all their faults; but from doing so every feeling within her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
shrank--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not, would not, dared not attempt it: had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) been
otherwise qualified for criticism, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conscience must have restrained
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from venturing at disapprobation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed herself to feel too
much of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars. To
prompt them must be enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and it was sometimes _more_ than
enough; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not always pay attention to the book. In watching
them she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) forgot herself; and, agitated by the increasing spirit of
Edmund's manner, had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
wanted help. It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
thanked and pitied; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) deserved their pity more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped they
would ever surmise. At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced herself
to add her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) praise to the compliments each was giving the other; and when
again alone and able to recall the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was inclined to believe
their performance would, indeed, have such nature and feeling in it as
must ensure their credit, and make it a very suffering exhibition to
herself. Whatever might be its effect, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must stand the brunt
of it again that very day.

<p/>The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly to
take place in the evening: Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to
return for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner; and every
one concerned was looking forward with eagerness. There seemed a general
diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion. Tom was enjoying such an
advance towards the end; Edmund was in spirits from the morning's
rehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away. All
were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the gentlemen soon
followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and
Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour; and having lighted
it up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only the
arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.

<p/>They did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there was no Mrs. Grant.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not come. Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
had little credit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fair sister-in-law, could not spare his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Grant is ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), with mock solemnity. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) has been ill ever
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) did not eat any of the pheasant today. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fancied it tough,
sent away his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) plate, and has been suffering ever since'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>Here was disappointment! Mrs. Grant's non-attendance was sad indeed.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) always valuable
amongst them; but _now_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was absolutely necessary. They could not
act, they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). The
comfort of the whole evening was destroyed. What was to be done? Tom, as
Cottager, was in despair. After a pause of perplexity, some eyes began
to be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, <div class="bookquote">``If Miss Price
would be so good as to _read_ the part.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was immediately surrounded
by supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, <div class="bookquote">``Do, Fanny, if
it is not _very_ disagreeable to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>But Fanny still hung back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not endure the idea of it. Why was
not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well? Or why had not she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) rather
gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own room, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had felt to be safest, instead of attending
the rehearsal at all? She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had known it would irritate and distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>);
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had known it her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) duty to keep away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was properly punished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have only to _read_ the part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Henry Crawford, with renewed
entreaty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I do believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) can say every word of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>added Maria, <div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places. Fanny, I am
sure you know the part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny could not say she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did _not_; and as they all persevered, as
Edmund repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wish, and with a look of even fond dependence on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good-nature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must yield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) best. Everybody was
satisfied; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart,
while the others prepared to begin.

<p/>They _did_ begin; and being too much engaged in their own noise to be
struck by an unusual noise in the other part of the house, had proceeded
some way when the door of the room was thrown open, and Julia, appearing
at it, with a face all aghast, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``My father is come! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is in
the hall at this moment.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIX

<p/>How is the consternation of the party to be described? To the greater
number it was a moment of absolute horror. Sir Thomas in the house! All
felt the instantaneous conviction. Not a hope of imposition or mistake
was harboured anywhere. Julia's looks were an evidence of the fact that
made it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations, not a
word was spoken for half a minute: each with an altered countenance was
looking at some other, and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most
unwelcome, most ill-timed, most appalling! Mr. Yates might consider
it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr. Rushworth
might imagine it a blessing; but every other heart was sinking under
some degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm, every other heart
was suggesting, <div class="bookquote">``What will become of us? what is to be done now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div>It
was a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were the corroborating
sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.

<p/>Julia was the first to move and speak again. Jealousy and bitterness
had been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause; but at the
moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of devotion
to Agatha's narrative, and pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) heart; and as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>)
words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) still kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) station and retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) sister's hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>)
wounded heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red as she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) had
been white before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) turned out of the room, saying, <div class="bookquote">``_I_ need not be
afraid of appearing before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) going roused the rest; and at the same moment the two brothers
stepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something. A very few
words between them were sufficient. The case admitted no difference of
opinion: they must go to the drawing-room directly. Maria joined them
with the same intent, just then the stoutest of the three; for the
very circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) the sweetest
support. Henry Crawford's retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) hand at such a moment, a moment
of such peculiar proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt and
anxiety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) hailed it as an earnest of the most serious determination,
and was equal even to encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) father. They walked off, utterly
heedless of Mr. Rushworth's repeated question of, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I go too? Had
not I better go too? Will not it be right for me to go too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div>but they
were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer
the anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) by all means to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
respects to Sir Thomas without delay, sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) after the others with
delighted haste.

<p/>Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been quite
overlooked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) claims on Sir
Thomas's affection was much too humble to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) any idea of classing
herself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) children, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was glad to remain behind and gain a
little breathing-time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) agitation and alarm exceeded all that was
endured by the rest, by the right of a disposition which not even
innocence could keep from suffering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was nearly fainting: all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
former habitual dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle was returning, and with it compassion
for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) and for almost every one of the party on the development before
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), with solicitude on Edmund's account indescribable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had found
a seat, where in excessive trembling she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was enduring all these fearful
thoughts, while the other three, no longer under any restraint, were
giving vent to their feelings of vexation, lamenting over such an
unlooked-for premature arrival as a most untoward event, and without
mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) passage, or
were still in Antigua.

<p/>The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates, from better
understanding the family, and judging more clearly of the mischief that
must ensue. The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt
the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr.
Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for the
evening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being
renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might be at leisure to be amused by it. The Crawfords laughed
at the idea; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walking
quietly home and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr. Yates's
accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage. But Mr.
Yates, having never been with those who thought much of parental claims,
or family confidence, could not perceive that anything of the kind was
necessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) preferred remaining
where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might pay his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) respects to the old gentleman
handsomely since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) _was_ come; and besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not think it would
be fair by the others to have everybody run away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was just beginning to collect herself, and to feel that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when this point was
settled, and being commissioned with the brother and sister's apology,
saw them preparing to go as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) quitted the room herself to perform the
dreadful duty of appearing before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>Too soon did she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) find herself at the drawing-room door; and after
pausing a moment for what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knew would not come, for a courage which
the outside of no door had ever supplied to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) turned the lock in
desperation, and the lights of the drawing-room, and all the collected
family, were before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) entered, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own name caught her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ear.
Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and saying, <div class="bookquote">``But where
is Fanny? Why do not I see my little Fanny?'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--and on perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),
came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) dear Fanny, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) affectionately, and observing
with decided pleasure how much she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was grown! Fanny knew not how to
feel, nor where to look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was quite oppressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had never been so
kind, so _very_ kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) manner seemed changed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
voice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that had been awful
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) dignity seemed lost in tenderness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nearer the light
and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) again--inquired particularly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) health, and
then, correcting himself, observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) need not inquire, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appearance spoke sufficiently on that point. A fine blush having
succeeded the previous paleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was justified in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
belief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) equal improvement in health and beauty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) inquired next
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) family, especially William: and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) kindness altogether was
such as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reproach herself for loving him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) so little, and thinking
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes to
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was grown thinner, and had the burnt, fagged,
worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender feeling was
increased, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was miserable in considering how much unsuspected
vexation was probably ready to burst on him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) suggestion
now seated themselves round the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had the best right to be the
talker; and the delight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sensations in being again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own
house, in the centre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, after such a separation, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was ready to
give every information as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) voyage, and answer every question
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) two sons almost before it was put. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) business in Antigua had
latterly been prosperously rapid, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) came directly from Liverpool,
having had an opportunity of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) passage thither in a private
vessel, instead of waiting for the packet; and all the little
particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) proceedings and events, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) arrivals and departures,
were most promptly delivered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sat by Lady Bertram and looked with
heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)--interrupting himself
more than once, however, to remark on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) good fortune in finding them
all at home--coming unexpectedly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did--all collected together
exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could have wished, but dared not depend on. Mr. Rushworth
was not forgotten: a most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shaking
had already met him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), and with pointed attention he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was now included in
the objects most intimately connected with Mansfield. There was nothing
disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth's appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) already.

<p/>By not one of the circle was he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) listened to with such unbroken,
unalloyed enjoyment as by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife, who was really extremely happy to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and whose feelings were so warmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sudden arrival as to
place her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nearer agitation than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been for the last twenty years.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained so
sensibly animated as to put away her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) work, move Pug from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side, and
give all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) attention and all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sofa to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)_ pleasure: her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own time had
been irreproachably spent during his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) absence: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done a great
deal of carpet-work, and made many yards of fringe; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have
answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all
the young people as for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own. It was so agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again, and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) talk, to have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ear amused and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whole
comprehension filled by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) narratives, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began particularly
to feel how dreadfully she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must have missed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and how impossible it
would have been for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to bear a lengthened absence.

<p/>Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
sister. Not that _she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)_ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas's
disapprobation when the present state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) house should be known, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive caution
with which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had whisked away Mr. Rushworth's pink satin cloak as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
brother-in-law entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could hardly be said to shew any sign of
alarm; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was vexed by the _manner_ of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) return. It had left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
nothing to do. Instead of being sent for out of the room, and seeing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) first, and having to spread the happy news through the house, Sir
Thomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the nerves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
wife and children, had sought no confidant but the butler, and had been
following him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) almost instantaneously into the drawing-room. Mrs. Norris
felt herself defrauded of an office on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had always depended,
whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) arrival or his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) death were to be the thing unfolded; and was
now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about,
and labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity
and silence. Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) might have gone
to the housekeeper with troublesome directions, and insulted the footmen
with injunctions of despatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all
dinner: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would take nothing, nothing till tea came--he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would rather
wait for tea. Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something
different; and in the most interesting moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) passage to England,
when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) burst
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) recital with the proposal of soup. <div class="bookquote">``Sure, my dear Sir
Thomas, a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea.
Do have a basin of soup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas could not be provoked. <div class="bookquote">``Still the same anxiety for
everybody's comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) answer. <div class="bookquote">``But indeed I
would rather have nothing but tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose
you hurry Baddeley a little; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddeley</b></font>) seems behindhand to-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) carried
this point, and Sir Thomas's narrative proceeded.

<p/>At length there was a pause. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) immediate communications were
exhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), now
at one, now at another of the beloved circle; but the pause was not
long: in the elation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and
what were the sensations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) children upon hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``How
do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, Sir
Thomas? They have been acting. We have been all alive with acting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! and what have you been acting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! they'll tell you all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The _all_ will soon be told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Tom hastily, and with affected
unconcern; <div class="bookquote">``but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now. You
will hear enough of it to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by way
of doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last week,
to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We have had such incessant rains
almost since October began, that we have been nearly confined to the
house for days together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd.
Tolerable sport the first three days, but there has been no attempting
anything since. The first day I went over Mansfield Wood, and Edmund
took the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace between
us, and might each have killed six times as many, but we respect your
pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire. I do not
think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they
were. _I_ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life
as this year. I hope you will take a day's sport there yourself, sir,
soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>For the present the danger was over, and Fanny's sick feelings subsided;
but when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas, getting up,
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not be any longer in the house without
just looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own dear room, every agitation was returning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
was gone before anything had been said to prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) for the change he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
must find there; and a pause of alarm followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) disappearance. Edmund
was the first to speak--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something must be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is time to think of our visitors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Miss Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, still feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
hand pressed to Henry Crawford's heart, and caring little for anything
else. <div class="bookquote">``Where did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then poor Yates is all alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Tom. <div class="bookquote">``I will go and fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)
will be no bad assistant when it all comes out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To the theatre he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went, and reached it just in time to witness the first
meeting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend. Sir Thomas had been a good deal
surprised to find candles burning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) room; and on casting his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eye
round it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air
of confusion in the furniture. The removal of the bookcase from before
the billiard-room door struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) especially, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had scarcely more
than time to feel astonished at all this, before there were sounds from
the billiard-room to astonish him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) still farther. Some one was talking
there in a very loud accent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did not know the voice--more than
talking--almost hallooing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stepped to the door, rejoicing at that
moment in having the means of immediate communication, and, opening it,
found himself on the stage of a theatre, and opposed to a ranting young
man, who appeared likely to knock him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down backwards. At the very moment
of Yates perceiving Sir Thomas, and giving perhaps the very best start
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had ever given in the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) rehearsals, Tom Bertram
entered at the other end of the room; and never had he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) found greater
difficulty in keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) countenance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) father's looks of solemnity
and amazement on this his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) first appearance on any stage, and the gradual
metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and
easy Mr. Yates, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was
such an exhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would not have
lost upon any account. It would be the last--in all probability--the
last scene on that stage; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was sure there could not be a finer.
The house would close with the greatest eclat.

<p/>There was little time, however, for the indulgence of any images of
merriment. It was necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to step forward, too, and assist
the introduction, and with many awkward sensations he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) best. Sir
Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which
was due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own character, but was really as far from pleased
with the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its
commencement. Mr. Yates's family and connexions were sufficiently known
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) to render his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) introduction as the <div class="bookquote">``particular friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>another of
the hundred particular friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) son, exceedingly unwelcome; and it
needed all the felicity of being again at home, and all the forbearance
it could supply, to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus
bewildered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own house, making part of a ridiculous exhibition in
the midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced in so untoward a moment to
admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt sure of disapproving,
and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first
five minutes seemed to mark him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the most at home of the two.

<p/>Tom understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's thoughts, and heartily wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might be
always as well disposed to give them but partial expression, began to
see, more clearly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had ever done before, that there might be some
ground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard-table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
not proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity. A few minutes were
enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side; and Sir
Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of
calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates, as to the
happiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen returned to the
drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was
not lost on all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come from your theatre,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) composedly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sat down; <div class="bookquote">``I found
myself in it rather unexpectedly. Its vicinity to my own room--but in
every respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the smallest
suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character. It
appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by candlelight,
and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would
have changed the subject, and sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) coffee in peace over domestic
matters of a calmer hue; but Mr. Yates, without discernment to catch Sir
Thomas's meaning, or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion enough to
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to lead the discourse while he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mingled among the others with
the least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) on the topic of the
theatre, would torment him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) with questions and remarks relative to it,
and finally would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hear the whole history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) disappointment
at Ecclesford. Sir Thomas listened most politely, but found much to
offend his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) ideas of decorum, and confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) ill-opinion of Mr. Yates's
habits of thinking, from the beginning to the end of the story; and when
it was over, could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) no other assurance of sympathy than what a
slight bow conveyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This was, in fact, the origin of _our_ acting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Tom, after
a moment's thought. <div class="bookquote">``My friend Yates brought the infection from
Ecclesford, and it spread--as those things always spread, you know,
sir--the faster, probably, from _your_ having so often encouraged the
sort of thing in us formerly. It was like treading old ground again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Yates/Yates</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Yates took the subject from his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) friend as soon as possible, and
immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were
doing: told him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) of the gradual increase of their views, the happy
conclusion of their first difficulties, and present promising state of
affairs; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) not
only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
friends as they sat, the change of countenance, the fidget, the hem! of
unquietness, but prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) even from seeing the expression of the
face on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own eyes were fixed--from seeing Sir Thomas's dark
brow contract as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) looked with inquiring earnestness at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters
and Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter, and speaking a
language, a remonstrance, a reproof, which _he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)_ felt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) heart. Not
less acutely was it felt by Fanny, who had edged back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) chair behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself, saw all
that was passing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
father she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could never have expected to witness; and to feel that it
was in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed. Sir Thomas's
look implied, <div class="bookquote">``On your judgment, Edmund, I depended; what have you
been about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knelt in spirit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bosom swelled to
utter, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, not to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_! Look so to all the others, but not to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Yates was still talking. <div class="bookquote">``To own the truth, Sir Thomas, we were in
the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening. We were going
through the three first acts, and not unsuccessfully upon the whole. Our
company is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home, that
nothing more can be done to-night; but if you will give us the honour of
your company to-morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the result. We
bespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young performers; we bespeak
your indulgence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My indulgence shall be given, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>replied Sir Thomas gravely, <div class="bookquote">``but
without any other rehearsal.''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>And with a relenting smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I
come home to be happy and indulgent.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then turning away towards any
or all of the rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) tranquilly said, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. and Miss Crawford were
mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeable
acquaintance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) being entirely
without particular regard for either, without jealousy either in love
or acting, could speak very handsomely of both. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Crawford was a
most pleasant, gentleman-like man; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister a sweet, pretty, elegant,
lively girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Rushworth could be silent no longer. <div class="bookquote">``I do not say he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is not
gentleman-like, considering; but you should tell your father he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is not
above five feet eight, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) will be expecting a well-looking man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas did not quite understand this, and looked with some surprise
at the speaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I must say what I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Rushworth, <div class="bookquote">``in my opinion it
is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much of a
good thing. I am not so fond of acting as I was at first. I think we are
a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves,
and doing nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth/Rushworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas looked again, and then replied with an approving smile, <div class="bookquote">``I am
happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same. It gives
me sincere satisfaction. That I should be cautious and quick-sighted,
and feel many scruples which my children do _not_ feel, is perfectly
natural; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity, for a
home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much exceed theirs. But at
your time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable circumstance
for yourself, and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible of
the importance of having an ally of such weight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth's opinion in better words
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could find himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must not expect a
genius in Mr. Rushworth; but as a well-judging, steady young man, with
better notions than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elocution would do justice to, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to
value him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very highly. It was impossible for many of the others not to
smile. Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning; but by
looking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) really felt, most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas's
good opinion, and saying scarcely anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) best towards
preserving that good opinion a little longer.



<p/>CHAPTER XX

<p/>Edmund's first object the next morning was to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father alone, and
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) a fair statement of the whole acting scheme, defending his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own
share in it as far only as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could then, in a soberer moment, feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
motives to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
judgment in it very doubtful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was anxious, while vindicating himself,
to say nothing unkind of the others: but there was only one amongst
them whose conduct he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could mention without some necessity of defence
or palliation. <div class="bookquote">``We have all been more or less to blame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``every
one of us, excepting Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly
throughout; who has been consistent. _Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ feelings have been steadily
against it from first to last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never ceased to think of what was due
to you. You will find Fanny everything you could wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party,
and at such a time, as strongly as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son had ever supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
felt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands with
Edmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and forget how
much he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been forgotten himself as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could, after the house
had been cleared of every object enforcing the remembrance, and restored
to its proper state. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not enter into any remonstrance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
other children: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was more willing to believe they felt their error
than to run the risk of investigation. The reproof of an immediate
conclusion of everything, the sweep of every preparation, would be
sufficient.

<p/>There was one person, however, in the house, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not leave
to learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sentiments merely through his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) conduct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not help
giving Mrs. Norris a hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) having hoped that her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) advice might
have been interposed to prevent what her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) judgment must certainly have
disapproved. The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming the
plan; they ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves;
but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) believed, of unsteady
characters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
acquiescence in their wrong measures, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) countenance of their unsafe
amusements, than that such measures and such amusements should have
been suggested. Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly
being silenced as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) life; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was ashamed to
confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was so glaring
to Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) influence was
insufficient--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) might have talked in vain. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) only resource was
to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn the current
of Sir Thomas's ideas into a happier channel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had a great deal to
insinuate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own praise as to _general_ attention to the interest
and comfort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, much exertion and many sacrifices to glance
at in the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own
fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust and economy to Lady
Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most considerable saving had
always arisen, and more than one bad servant been detected. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
chief strength lay in Sotherton. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) greatest support and glory was
in having formed the connexion with the Rushworths. _There_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
was impregnable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) took to herself all the credit of bringing Mr.
Rushworth's admiration of Maria to any effect. <div class="bookquote">``If I had not been
active,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and made a point of being introduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother,
and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit, I am as certain
as I sit here that nothing would have come of it; for Mr. Rushworth
is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of
encouragement, and there were girls enough on the catch for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) if we
had been idle. But I left no stone unturned. I was ready to move heaven
and earth to persuade my sister, and at last I did persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). You
know the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle of winter, and the
roads almost impassable, but I did persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know how great, how justly great, your influence is with Lady Bertram
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) children, and am the more concerned that it should not have
been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads _that_ day!
I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four
horses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
great love and kindness, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was hardly able to sit the box on
account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) for ever since
Michaelmas. I cured him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) at last; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was very bad all the winter--and
this was such a day, I could not help going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) room before
we set off to advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) not to venture: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wig; so
I said, `Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I shall be
very safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has been upon the
leaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.' But, however, I
soon found it would not do; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was bent upon going, and as I hate to be
worrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart quite ached for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke, where,
what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it was worse than anything
you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). And then the poor
horses too! To see them straining away! You know how I always feel for
the horses. And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do you
think I did? You will laugh at me; but I got out and walked up. I did
indeed. It might not be saving them much, but it was something, and I
could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of
those noble animals. I caught a dreadful cold, but _that_ I did not
regard. My object was accomplished in the visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that
might be taken to establish it. There is nothing very striking in Mr.
Rushworth's manners, but I was pleased last night with what appeared to
be his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) opinion on one subject: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) decided preference of a quiet family
party to the bustle and confusion of acting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) seemed to feel exactly
as one could wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, indeed, and the more you know of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) the better you will like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) is not a shining character, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) has a thousand good qualities; and
is so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about it,
for everybody considers it as my doing. `Upon my word, Mrs. Norris,'
said Mrs. Grant the other day, `if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect.'''

<p/>Sir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) evasions, disarmed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
flattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that
where the present pleasure of those she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) loved was at stake, her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) kindness
did sometimes overpower her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) judgment.

<p/>It was a busy morning with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). Conversation with any of them occupied
but a small part of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had to reinstate himself in all the wonted
concerns of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) Mansfield life: to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) steward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) bailiff; to
examine and compute, and, in the intervals of business, to walk into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stables and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) gardens, and nearest plantations; but active and
methodical, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had not only done all this before he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) seat as
master of the house at dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had also set the carpenter to work in
pulling down what had been so lately put up in the billiard-room,
and given the scene-painter his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) dismissal long enough to justify the
pleasing belief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) being then at least as far off as Northampton.
The scene-painter was gone, having spoilt only the floor of one room,
ruined all the coachman's sponges, and made five of the under-servants
idle and dissatisfied; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or
two would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been,
even to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers' Vows in the
house, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was burning all that met his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas's intentions,
though as far as ever from understanding their source. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) friend
had been out with their guns the chief of the morning, and Tom had taken
the opportunity of explaining, with proper apologies for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's
particularity, what was to be expected. Mr. Yates felt it as acutely as
might be supposed. To be a second time disappointed in the same way was
an instance of very severe ill-luck; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) indignation was such,
that had it not been for delicacy towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) friend, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) friend's
youngest sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) should certainly attack the baronet
on the absurdity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) proceedings, and argue him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) into a little more
rationality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) believed this very stoutly while he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) was in Mansfield
Wood, and all the way home; but there was a something in Sir Thomas,
when they sat round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think it
wiser to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) own way, and feel the folly of it without
opposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) had known many disagreeable fathers before, and often
been struck with the inconveniences they occasioned, but never, in
the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) life, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) seen one of that class so
unintelligibly moral, so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was
not a man to be endured but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) children's sake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might be
thankful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay
a few days longer under his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) roof.

<p/>The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every
mind was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony. Maria was in a
good deal of agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) that
Crawford should now lose no time in declaring himself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was
disturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance
that point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been expecting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) the whole morning, and
all the evening, too, was still expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). Mr. Rushworth had set off
early with the great news for Sotherton; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had fondly hoped for
such an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) the trouble of
ever coming back again. But they had seen no one from the Parsonage,
not a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of
congratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram. It was the
first day for many, many weeks, in which the families had been wholly
divided. Four-and-twenty hours had never passed before, since August
began, without bringing them together in some way or other. It was a
sad, anxious day; and the morrow, though differing in the sort of evil,
did by no means bring less. A few moments of feverish enjoyment were
followed by hours of acute suffering. Henry Crawford was again in the
house: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) respects
to Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the
breakfast-room, where were most of the family. Sir Thomas soon appeared,
and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
loved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) father. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sensations were indefinable, and so were they
a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford, who had a chair
between herself and Tom, ask the latter in an undervoice whether
there were any plans for resuming the play after the present happy
interruption -LRB-with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas-RRB-, because, in that
case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time
required by the party: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was going away immediately, being to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
uncle at Bath without delay; but if there were any prospect of a renewal
of Lovers' Vows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should hold himself positively engaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should
break through every other claim, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should absolutely condition with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
uncle for attending them whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might be wanted. The play should
not be lost by _his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)_ absence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I will
attend you from any place in England, at an hour's notice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was well at that moment that Tom had to speak, and not his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
could immediately say with easy fluency, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you are going;
but as to our play, _that_ is all over--entirely at an end''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-looking
significantly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``The painter was sent off yesterday, and
very little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew how _that_
would be from the first. It is early for Bath. You will find nobody
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is about my uncle's usual time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When do you think of going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose stables do you use at Bath?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the next question; and while
this branch of the subject was under discussion, Maria, who wanted
neither pride nor resolution, was preparing to encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) share of it
with tolerable calmness.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) soon turned, repeating much of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had already said, with
only a softened air and stronger expressions of regret. But what availed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) expressions or his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) air? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going, and, if not voluntarily going,
voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting what might be due
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) uncle, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) engagements were all self-imposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might talk of
necessity, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) independence. The hand which had so pressed
hers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart! the hand and the heart were alike motionless and
passive now! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) spirit supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), but the agony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mind was
severe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had not long to endure what arose from listening to language
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) actions contradicted, or to bury the tumult of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) feelings
under the restraint of society; for general civilities soon called
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) notice from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and the farewell visit, as it then became openly
acknowledged, was a very short one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was gone--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
hand for the last time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) parting bow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) might seek
directly all that solitude could do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Henry Crawford was gone,
gone from the house, and within two hours afterwards from the parish;
and so ended all the hopes his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) selfish vanity had raised in Maria and
Julia Bertram.

<p/>Julia could rejoice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was gone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) presence was beginning to be
odious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>); and if Maria gained him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was now cool enough to
dispense with any other revenge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) did not want exposure to be added
to desertion. Henry Crawford gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could even pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sister.

<p/>With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heard it
at dinner, and felt it a blessing. By all the others it was mentioned
with regret; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) merits honoured with due gradation of feeling--from
the sincerity of Edmund's too partial regard, to the unconcern of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mother speaking entirely by rote. Mrs. Norris began to look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>),
and wonder that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) falling in love with Julia had come to nothing; and
could almost fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had been remiss herself in forwarding it; but
with so many to care for, how was it possible for even _her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)_ activity to
keep pace with her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) wishes?

<p/>Another day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise. In _his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)_ departure
Sir Thomas felt the chief interest: wanting to be alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family,
the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been irksome;
but of him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>), trifling and confident, idle and expensive, it was every way
vexatious. In himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) was wearisome, but as the friend of Tom and
the admirer of Julia he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) became offensive. Sir Thomas had been quite
indifferent to Mr. Crawford's going or staying: but his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) good wishes
for Mr. Yates's having a pleasant journey, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) to the
hall-door, were given with genuine satisfaction. Mr. Yates had staid to
see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield, the
removal of everything appertaining to the play: he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) left the house in all
the soberness of its general character; and Sir Thomas hoped, in seeing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) out of it, to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme,
and the last that must be inevitably reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) of its existence.

<p/>Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sight that might
have distressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). The curtain, over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had presided with such
talent and such success, went off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) cottage, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
happened to be particularly in want of green baize.



<p/>CHAPTER XXI

<p/>Sir Thomas's return made a striking change in the ways of the family,
independent of Lovers' Vows. Under his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) government, Mansfield was an
altered place. Some members of their society sent away, and the spirits
of many others saddened--it was all sameness and gloom compared with
the past--a sombre family party rarely enlivened. There was little
intercourse with the Parsonage. Sir Thomas, drawing back from intimacies
in general, was particularly disinclined, at this time, for any
engagements but in one quarter. The Rushworths were the only addition to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own domestic circle which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could solicit.

<p/>Edmund did not wonder that such should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father's feelings, nor
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants. <div class="bookquote">``But they,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
observed to Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``have a claim. They seem to belong to us; they seem
to be part of ourselves. I could wish my father were more sensible of
their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was away. I
am afraid they may feel themselves neglected. But the truth is, that my
father hardly knows them. They had not been here a twelvemonth when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
left England. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew them better, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would value their society as it
deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would
like. We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves: my
sisters seem out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ease. Dr.
and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings pass away with
more enjoyment even to my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny uncle</b></font>)</div>said Fanny: <div class="bookquote">``in my opinion, my uncle would not like
_any_ addition. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) values the very quietness you speak of, and
that the repose of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own family circle is all he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wants. And it does
not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be--I mean
before my uncle went abroad. As well as I can recollect, it was always
much the same. There was never much laughing in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) presence; or, if
there is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence
has a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness; but
I cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry, except
when my uncle was in town. No young people's are, I suppose, when those
they look up to are at home'' (<font color='red'><b>Fanny uncle</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you are right, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) reply, after a short
consideration. <div class="bookquote">``I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they
were, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their being
lively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give!
I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am graver than other people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``The evenings do
not appear long to me. I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies.
I could listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) for an hour together. It entertains _me_ more than
many other things have done; but then I am unlike other people, I dare
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you dare say _that_?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-smiling-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want to be told
that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet?
But when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny? Go
to my father if you want to be complimented. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will satisfy you. Ask
your uncle what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: and
though they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and
trust to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seeing as much beauty of mind in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny--and that is the long and
the short of the matter. Anybody but myself would have made something
more of it, and anybody but you would resent that you had not been
thought very pretty before; but the truth is, that your uncle never
did admire you till now--and now he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) does. Your complexion is so
improved!--and you have gained so much countenance!--and your
figure--nay, Fanny, do not turn away about it--it is but an uncle. If
you cannot bear an uncle's admiration, what is to become of you? You
must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking
at. You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! don't talk so, don't talk so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, distressed by more
feelings than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was aware of; but seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was distressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
had done with the subject, and only added more seriously--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect; and I
only wish you would talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) more. You are one of those who are too
silent in the evening circle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) more than I used. I am sure I do. Did not you hear
me ask him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) about the slave-trade last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did--and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others. It
would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I longed to do it--but there was such a dead silence! And while
my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word, or seeming at all
interested in the subject, I did not like--I thought it would appear as
if I wanted to set myself off at their expense, by shewing a curiosity
and pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) information which he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) must wish his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own daughters to
feel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Crawford was very right in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said of you the other day:
that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women
were of neglect. We were talking of you at the Parsonage, and those were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has great discernment. I know nobody who distinguishes
characters better. For so young a woman it is remarkable! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) certainly
understands _you_ better than you are understood by the greater part of
those who have known you so long; and with regard to some others, I can
perceive, from occasional lively hints, the unguarded expressions of
the moment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could define _many_ as accurately, did not delicacy
forbid it. I wonder what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinks of my father! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must admire him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
as a fine-looking man, with most gentlemanlike, dignified, consistent
manners; but perhaps, having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so seldom, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reserve may be
a little repulsive. Could they be much together, I feel sure of their
liking each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liveliness and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has talents to
value his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) powers. I wish they met more frequently! I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not
suppose there is any dislike on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, with half a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``to have any such apprehension. And Sir
Thomas's wishing just at first to be only with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, is so very
natural, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can argue nothing from that. After a little while, I
dare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way, allowing
for the difference of the time of year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the first October that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has passed in the country since her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
infancy. I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country; and November
is a still more serious month, and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very
anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to say nothing, and
leave untouched all Miss Crawford's resources--her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) accomplishments, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
spirits, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) importance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) friends, lest it should betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) into
any observations seemingly unhandsome. Miss Crawford's kind opinion of
herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) began to talk
of something else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you and Mr.
Bertram too. We shall be quite a small party at home. I hope my uncle
may continue to like Mr. Rushworth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is impossible, Fanny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) must like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) less after to-morrow's
visit, for we shall be five hours in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) company. I should dread
the stupidity of the day, if there were not a much greater evil to
follow--the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) cannot much
longer deceive himself. I am sorry for them all, and would give
something that Rushworth and Maria had never met.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>In this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas.
Not all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) good-will for Mr. Rushworth, not all Mr. Rushworth's
deference for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), could prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) from soon discerning some part of
the truth--that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorant
in business as in books, with opinions in general unfixed, and without
seeming much aware of it himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning to feel
grave on Maria's account, tried to understand _her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)_ feelings. Little
observation there was necessary to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) that indifference was the
most favourable state they could be in. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) behaviour to Mr. Rushworth
was careless and cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could not, did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). Sir Thomas
resolved to speak seriously to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Advantageous as would be the
alliance, and long standing and public as was the engagement, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
happiness must not be sacrificed to it. Mr. Rushworth had, perhaps, been
accepted on too short an acquaintance, and, on knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) better, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
was repenting.

<p/>With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>): told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) fears,
inquired into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wishes, entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to be open and sincere, and
assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) that every inconvenience should be braved, and the connexion
entirely given up, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
would act for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) and release her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Maria had a moment's struggle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
listened, and only a moment's: when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) father ceased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was able to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) answer immediately, decidedly, and with no apparent agitation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) great attention, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) paternal kindness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was quite mistaken in supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had the smallest desire of breaking
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) engagement, or was sensible of any change of opinion or
inclination since her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) forming it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had the highest esteem for Mr.
Rushworth's character and disposition, and could not have a doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
happiness with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>).

<p/>Sir Thomas was satisfied; too glad to be satisfied, perhaps, to urge the
matter quite so far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) judgment might have dictated to others. It
was an alliance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not have relinquished without pain;
and thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) reasoned. Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve. Mr.
Rushworth must and would improve in good society; and if Maria could now
speak so securely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) happiness with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), speaking certainly without
the prejudice, the blindness of love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ought to be believed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
feelings, probably, were not acute; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had never supposed them to be
so; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) comforts might not be less on that account; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could
dispense with seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) husband a leading, shining character, there
would certainly be everything else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) favour. A well-disposed young
woman, who did not marry for love, was in general but the more attached
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own family; and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield
must naturally hold out the greatest temptation, and would, in all
probability, be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent
enjoyments. Such and such-like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas,
happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture, the wonder,
the reflections, the reproach that must attend it; happy to secure a
marriage which would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) such an addition of respectability
and influence, and very happy to think anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughter's
disposition that was most favourable for the purpose.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was in a
state of mind to be glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had secured her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fate beyond recall:
that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had pledged herself anew to Sotherton; that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was safe from
the possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) actions,
and destroying her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) prospects; and retired in proud resolve, determined
only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
father might not be again suspecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).

<p/>Had Sir Thomas applied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughter within the first three or four
days after Henry Crawford's leaving Mansfield, before her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feelings were
at all tranquillised, before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had given up every hope of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>), or
absolutely resolved on enduring his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) rival, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) answer might have been
different; but after another three or four days, when there was no
return, no letter, no message, no symptom of a softened heart, no hope
of advantage from separation, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mind became cool enough to seek all
the comfort that pride and self revenge could give.

<p/>Henry Crawford had destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) happiness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should not know that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had done it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should not destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) credit, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) appearance, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
prosperity, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should not have to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as pining in the
retirement of Mansfield for _him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_, rejecting Sotherton and London,
independence and splendour, for _his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ sake. Independence was more
needful than ever; the want of it at Mansfield more sensibly felt. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
was less and less able to endure the restraint which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father imposed.
The liberty which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) absence had given was now become absolutely
necessary. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must escape from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Mansfield as soon as possible,
and find consolation in fortune and consequence, bustle and the world,
for a wounded spirit. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mind was quite determined, and varied not.

<p/>To such feelings delay, even the delay of much preparation, would have
been an evil, and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the
marriage than herself. In all the important preparations of the mind
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was complete: being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home,
restraint, and tranquillity; by the misery of disappointed affection,
and contempt of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was to marry. The rest might wait. The
preparations of new carriages and furniture might wait for London and
spring, when her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own taste could have fairer play.

<p/>The principals being all agreed in this respect, it soon appeared that a
very few weeks would be sufficient for such arrangements as must precede
the wedding.

<p/>Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire, and make way for the fortunate
young woman whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) dear son had selected; and very early in November
removed herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) maid, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) footman, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) chariot, with true
dowager propriety, to Bath, there to parade over the wonders of
Sotherton in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) evening parties; enjoying them as thoroughly, perhaps,
in the animation of a card-table, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had ever done on the spot; and
before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which
gave Sotherton another mistress.

<p/>It was a very proper wedding. The bride was elegantly dressed; the two
bridesmaids were duly inferior; her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) father gave her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) away; her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mother
stood with salts in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hand, expecting to be agitated; her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) aunt tried
to cry; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant. Nothing
could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the
neighbourhood, except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and
bridegroom and Julia from the church-door to Sotherton was the same
chaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before. In
everything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictest
investigation.

<p/>It was done, and they were gone. Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father
must feel, and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wife had been apprehensive of for herself, but had fortunately escaped.
Mrs. Norris, most happy to assist in the duties of the day, by spending
it at the Park to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sister's spirits, and drinking the health
of Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two, was all
joyous delight; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had made the match; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had done everything;
and no one would have supposed, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) confident triumph, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) life, or could have the
smallest insight into the disposition of the niece who had been brought
up under her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) eye.

<p/>The plan of the young couple was to proceed, after a few days, to
Brighton, and take a house there for some weeks. Every public place was
new to Maria, and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer. When
the novelty of amusement there was over, it would be time for the wider
range of London.

<p/>Julia was to go with them to Brighton. Since rivalry between the sisters
had ceased, they had been gradually recovering much of their former good
understanding; and were at least sufficiently friends to make each of
them exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time. Some other
companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) lady;
and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) might not have struggled through so much to obtain them, and could
better bear a subordinate situation.

<p/>Their departure made another material change at Mansfield, a chasm
which required some time to fill up. The family circle became greatly
contracted; and though the Miss Bertrams had latterly added little to
its gaiety, they could not but be missed. Even their mother missed them;
and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered about
the house, and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree of
affectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve!



<p/>CHAPTER XXII

<p/>Fanny's consequence increased on the departure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins. Becoming,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) then did, the only young woman in the drawing-room, the only
occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
hitherto held so humble a third, it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not to be
more looked at, more thought of and attended to, than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had ever been
before; and <div class="bookquote">``Where is Fanny?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>became no uncommon question, even without
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being wanted for any one's convenience.

<p/>Not only at home did her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) value increase, but at the Parsonage too. In
that house, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had hardly entered twice a year since Mr. Norris's
death, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) became a welcome, an invited guest, and in the gloom and dirt
of a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) visits there,
beginning by chance, were continued by solicitation. Mrs. Grant,
really eager to get any change for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister, could, by the easiest
self-deceit, persuade herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was doing the kindest thing by
Fanny, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the most important opportunities of improvement in
pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) frequent calls.

<p/>Fanny, having been sent into the village on some errand by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
Norris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage; and
being descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter
under the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their
premises, was forced, though not without some modest reluctance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
part, to come in. A civil servant she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had withstood; but when Dr. Grant
himself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to
be very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible; and
to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal rain
in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
plan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a
single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the
sound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price
dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful. The value of an
event on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being
useful to Fanny, in detecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be wetter than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would at first
allow, and providing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with dry clothes; and Fanny, after being
obliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and
waited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning
downstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the rain
continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus
extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spirits to the period
of dressing and dinner.

<p/>The two sisters were so kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and so pleasant, that Fanny might
have enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) visit could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have believed herself not in the way,
and could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at
the end of the hour, and save her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from the shame of having Dr. Grant's
carriage and horses out to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was threatened.
As to anxiety for any alarm that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) absence in such weather might
occasion at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nothing to suffer on that score; for as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
being out was known only to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) two aunts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was perfectly aware that
none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse
to establish her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) during the rain, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) being in such cottage would be
indubitable to aunt Bertram.

<p/>It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in the
room, asked some questions about it, which soon led to an acknowledgment
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wishing very much to hear it, and a confession, which could
hardly be believed, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) having never yet heard it since its being
in Mansfield. To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and natural
circumstance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since the
instrument's arrival, there had been no reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should; but Miss
Crawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject, was
concerned at her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own neglect; and <div class="bookquote">``Shall I play to you now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``What
will you have?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were questions immediately following with the readiest
good-humour.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) played accordingly; happy to have a new listener, and a listener who
seemed so much obliged, so full of wonder at the performance, and who
shewed herself not wanting in taste. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) played till Fanny's eyes,
straying to the window on the weather's being evidently fair, spoke what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt must be done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another quarter of an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``and we shall see how
it will be. Do not run away the first moment of its holding up. Those
clouds look alarming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they are passed over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``I have been watching them. This
weather is all from the south.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it; and you must not
set forward while it is so threatening. And besides, I want to play
something more to you--a very pretty piece--and your cousin Edmund's
prime favourite. You must stay and hear your cousin's favourite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not waited for that
sentence to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) particularly
awake to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) idea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fancied him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sitting in that room again
and again, perhaps in the very spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat now, listening with
constant delight to the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
with superior tone and expression; and though pleased with it herself,
and glad to like whatever was liked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was more sincerely
impatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been before;
and on this being evident, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was so kindly asked to call again, to
take them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walk whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could, to come and hear more of the
harp, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it necessary to be done, if no objection arose at
home.

<p/>Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between
them within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams' going away--an
intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford's desire of something
new, and which had little reality in Fanny's feelings. Fanny went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
every two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not
be easy without going, and yet it was without loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), without ever
thinking like her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), without any sense of obligation for being sought
after now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no higher
pleasure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conversation than occasional amusement, and _that_
often at the expense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry
on people or subjects which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished to be respected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went,
however, and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs.
Grant's shrubbery, the weather being unusually mild for the time of
year, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now
comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the midst
of some tender ejaculation of Fanny's on the sweets of so protracted
an autumn, they were forced, by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking
down the last few yellow leaves about them, to jump up and walk for
warmth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is pretty, very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, looking around her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as
they were thus sitting together one day; <div class="bookquote">``every time I come into this
shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty. Three years ago,
this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field,
never thought of as anything, or capable of becoming anything; and now
it is converted into a walk, and it would be difficult to say whether
most valuable as a convenience or an ornament; and perhaps, in another
three years, we may be forgetting--almost forgetting what it was before.
How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and the
changes of the human mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>And following the latter train of thought,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) soon afterwards added: <div class="bookquote">``If any one faculty of our nature may be
called _more_ wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There
seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers,
the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our
intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so
obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so
tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way;
but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past
finding out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing to say; and
Fanny, perceiving it, brought back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own mind to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought must
interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may seem impertinent in _me_ to praise, but I must admire the taste
Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this. There is such a quiet simplicity in
the plan of the walk! Not too much attempted!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Crawford carelessly, <div class="bookquote">``it does very well for a
place of this sort. One does not think of extent _here_; and between
ourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country parson
ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, in reply. <div class="bookquote">``My
uncle's gardener always says the soil here is better than his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) own, and
so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general.
The evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen!
When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some
countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that
does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should
nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence.
You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especially
when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of
wondering strain. One cannot fix one's eyes on the commonest natural
production without finding food for a rambling fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To say the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``I am something like the
famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.; and may declare that I see no
wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody had
told me a year ago that this place would be my home, that I should be
spending month after month here, as I have done, I certainly should
not have believed them. I have now been here nearly five months; and,
moreover, the quietest five months I ever passed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Too_ quiet for you, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought so _theoretically_ myself, but,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eyes
brightened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``take it all and all, I never spent so happy a
summer. But then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, <div class="bookquote">``there
is no saying what it may lead to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny's heart beat quick, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt quite unequal to surmising
or soliciting anything more. Miss Crawford, however, with renewed
animation, soon went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence
than I had ever expected to be. I can even suppose it pleasant to
spend _half_ the year in the country, under certain circumstances,
very pleasant. An elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of family
connexions; continual engagements among them; commanding the first
society in the neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading it even
more than those of larger fortune, and turning from the cheerful round
of such amusements to nothing worse than a _tete-a-tete_ with the person
one feels most agreeable in the world. There is nothing frightful in
such a picture, is there, Miss Price? One need not envy the new Mrs.
Rushworth with such a home as _that_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Envy Mrs. Rushworth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>was all that Fanny attempted to say. <div class="bookquote">``Come, come,
it would be very un-handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth, for I
look forward to our owing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) a great many gay, brilliant, happy hours.
I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year. Such
a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing; for the first
pleasures of Mr. Rushworth's wife must be to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) house, and give
the best balls in the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness, till
suddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
here he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) is.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund, who then
appeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant. <div class="bookquote">``My sister and Mr.
Bertram. I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone, that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) may be Mr.
Bertram again. There is something in the sound of Mr. _Edmund_ Bertram
so formal, so pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How differently we feel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``To me, the sound of _Mr._
Bertram is so cold and nothing-meaning, so entirely without warmth or
character! It just stands for a gentleman, and that's all. But there is
nobleness in the name of Edmund. It is a name of heroism and renown; of
kings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry
and warm affections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I grant you the name is good in itself, and _Lord_ Edmund or _Sir_
Edmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill, the annihilation
of a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas. Well,
shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting
down out of doors at this time of year, by being up before they can
begin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund met them with particular pleasure. It was the first time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
seeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintance
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been hearing of with great satisfaction. A friendship
between two so very dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could have wished:
and to the credit of the lover's understanding, be it stated, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
did not by any means consider Fanny as the only, or even as the greater
gainer by such a friendship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``and do you not scold us for our imprudence?
What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to
about it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I might have scolded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``if either of you had been
sitting down alone; but while you do wrong together, I can overlook a
great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They cannot have been sitting long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Grant, <div class="bookquote">``for when I went
up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window, and then they were
walking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>added Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``the day is so mild, that your sitting down
for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent. Our weather must
not always be judged by the calendar. We may sometimes take greater
liberties in November than in May.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``you are two of the most
disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with! There is no
giving you a moment's uneasiness. You do not know how much we have been
suffering, nor what chills we have felt! But I have long thought Mr.
Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on, in any little manoeuvre
against common sense, that a woman could be plagued with. I had very
little hope of _him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_ from the first; but you, Mrs. Grant, my sister, my
own sister, I think I had a right to alarm you a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary. You have not the smallest
chance of moving me. I have my alarms, but they are quite in a different
quarter; and if I could have altered the weather, you would have had a
good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time--for here are some of
my plants which Robert _will_ leave out because the nights are so mild,
and I know the end of it will be, that we shall have a sudden change of
weather, a hard frost setting in all at once, taking everybody -LRB-at least
Robert-RRB- by surprise, and I shall lose every one; and what is worse, cook
has just been telling me that the turkey, which I particularly wished
not to be dressed till Sunday, because I know how much more Dr. Grant
would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day, will not keep
beyond to-morrow. These are something like grievances, and make me think
the weather most unseasonably close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sweets of housekeeping in a country village!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford
archly. <div class="bookquote">``Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St.
Paul's, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you
could be. But we have no such people in Mansfield. What would you have
me do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you can do nothing but what you do already: be plagued very often,
and never lose your temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, live
where we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, I
dare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and
the poulterer, perhaps on their very account. Their remoteness and
unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing
forth bitter lamentations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort.
A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. It
certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You intend to be very rich?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, with a look which, to Fanny's
eye, had a great deal of serious meaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. Do not you? Do not we all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power
to command. Miss Crawford may chuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) degree of wealth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has only
to fix on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) number of thousands a year, and there can be no doubt of
their coming. My intentions are only not to be poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By moderation and economy, and bringing down your wants to your income,
and all that. I understand you--and a very proper plan it is for a
person at your time of life, with such limited means and indifferent
connexions. What can _you_ want but a decent maintenance? You have
not much time before you; and your relations are in no situation to do
anything for you, or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth
and consequence. Be honest and poor, by all means--but I shall not envy
you; I do not much think I shall even respect you. I have a much greater
respect for those that are honest and rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor, is precisely what
I have no manner of concern with. I do not mean to be poor. Poverty
is exactly what I have determined against. Honesty, in the something
between, in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that I am
anxious for your not looking down on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do look down upon it, if it might have been higher. I must
look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to
distinction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how may it rise? How may my honesty at least rise to any
distinction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was not so very easy a question to answer, and occasioned an <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>of some length from the fair lady before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could add, <div class="bookquote">``You ought to be
in parliament, or you should have gone into the army ten years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_That_ is not much to the purpose now; and as to my being in
parliament, I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for
the representation of younger sons who have little to live on. No, Miss
Crawford,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) added, in a more serious tone, <div class="bookquote">``there _are_ distinctions
which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any
chance--absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining--but they
are of a different character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A look of consciousness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) spoke, and what seemed a consciousness
of manner on Miss Crawford's side as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) made some laughing answer,
was sorrowfull food for Fanny's observation; and finding herself quite
unable to attend as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was now
following the others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nearly resolved on going home immediately,
and only waited for courage to say so, when the sound of the great clock
at Mansfield Park, striking three, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
really been much longer absent than usual, and brought the previous
self-inquiry of whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should take leave or not just then, and how,
to a very speedy issue. With undoubting decision she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) directly began her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
adieus; and Edmund began at the same time to recollect that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother
had been inquiring for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had walked down to the Parsonage
on purpose to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back.

<p/>Fanny's hurry increased; and without in the least expecting Edmund's
attendance, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have hastened away alone; but the general pace was
quickened, and they all accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into the house, through which it
was necessary to pass. Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as they stopt
to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) found, from Edmund's manner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) _did_ mean to
go with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) too was taking leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not but be thankful. In
the moment of parting, Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mutton
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the next day; and Fanny had barely time for an unpleasant
feeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant, with sudden recollection,
turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and asked for the pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) company too. This was
so new an attention, so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of
Fanny's life, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was all surprise and embarrassment; and while
stammering out her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) great obligation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not suppose it
would be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) power,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was looking at Edmund for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) opinion and help.
But Edmund, delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) having such an happiness offered, and
ascertaining with half a look, and half a sentence, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no
objection but on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's account, could not imagine that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother
would make any difficulty of sparing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and therefore gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) decided
open advice that the invitation should be accepted; and though Fanny
would not venture, even on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) encouragement, to such a flight of
audacious independence, it was soon settled, that if nothing were heard
to the contrary, Mrs. Grant might expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you know what your dinner will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Grant, smiling--<div class="bookquote">``the
turkey, and I assure you a very fine one; for, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
husband, <div class="bookquote">``cook insists upon the turkey's being dressed to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div>cried Dr. Grant, <div class="bookquote">``all the better; I am glad
to hear you have anything so good in the house. But Miss Price and Mr.
Edmund Bertram, I dare say, would take their chance. We none of us want
to hear the bill of fare. A friendly meeting, and not a fine dinner,
is all we have in view. A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton, or
whatever you and your cook chuse to give us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div><p/>The two cousins walked home together; and, except in the immediate
discussion of this engagement, which Edmund spoke of with the warmest
satisfaction, as so particularly desirable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) in the intimacy which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw with so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk; for
having finished that subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) grew thoughtful and indisposed for any
other.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIII

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram. <div class="bookquote">``How came she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
to think of asking Fanny? Fanny never dines there, you know, in this
sort of way. I cannot spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not want to go.
Fanny, you do not want to go, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you put such a question to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Edmund, preventing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
cousin's speaking, <div class="bookquote">``Fanny will immediately say No; but I am sure, my
dear mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would like to go; and I can see no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
should not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) never
did before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) used to ask your sisters now and then, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) never
asked Fanny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you cannot do without me, ma’am--''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, in a self-denying
tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my mother will have my father with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, so I shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose you take my father's opinion, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's well thought of. So I will, Edmund. I will ask Sir Thomas, as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) comes in, whether I can do without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you please, ma’am, on that head; but I meant my father's opinion
as to the _propriety_ of the invitation's being accepted or not; and
I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by
Fanny, that being the _first_ invitation it should be accepted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. We will ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be very much surprised that
Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing more to be said, or that could be said to any purpose,
till Sir Thomas were present; but the subject involving, as it did,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own evening's comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in Lady
Bertram's mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) looking in for a
minute in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) way from his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) plantation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) dressing-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) called
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) back again, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had almost closed the door, with <div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas,
stop a moment--I have something to say to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) tone of calm languor, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) never took the trouble of raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
voice, was always heard and attended to; and Sir Thomas came back. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
story began; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room; for to hear
herself the subject of any discussion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle was more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
nerves could bear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was anxious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew--more anxious perhaps than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to be--for what was it after all whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went or staid?
but if her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding, and
with very grave looks, and those grave looks directed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and
at last decide against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might not be able to appear properly
submissive and indifferent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cause, meanwhile, went on well. It
began, on Lady Bertram's part, with--<div class="bookquote">``I have something to tell you that
will surprise you. Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Edmund wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to go. But how can I spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) will be late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) watch; <div class="bookquote">``but what is
your difficulty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mother's story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) told the whole; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had only to add, <div class="bookquote">``So strange!
for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is it not very natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>observed Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``that Mrs. Grant should
wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing can be more natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, after a short
deliberation; <div class="bookquote">``nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything,
in my opinion, be more natural. Mrs. Grant's shewing civility to Miss
Price, to Lady Bertram's niece, could never want explanation. The only
surprise I can feel is, that this should be the _first_ time of its
being paid. Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional
answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appears to feel as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought. But as I conclude that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
must wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see
no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be denied the indulgence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But can I do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), Sir Thomas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I think you may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us, and
I shall certainly be at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The good news soon followed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Edmund knocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) way
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without the smallest
hesitation on your uncle's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had but one opinion. You are to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I am _so_ glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>was Fanny's instinctive reply; though when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) and shut the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not help feeling,
<div class="bookquote">``And yet why should I be glad? for am I not certain of seeing or hearing
something there to pain me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of this conviction, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was glad. Simple as such an
engagement might appear in other eyes, it had novelty and importance in
hers, for excepting the day at Sotherton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had scarcely ever dined
out before; and though now going only half a mile, and only to three
people, still it was dining out, and all the little interests of
preparation were enjoyments in themselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had neither sympathy nor
assistance from those who ought to have entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings and
directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) taste; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to
anybody, and Mrs. Norris, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) came on the morrow, in consequence of
an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill humour,
and seemed intent only on lessening her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) niece's pleasure, both present
and future, as much as possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet with such attention
and indulgence! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for
thinking of you, and to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought to
look upon it as something extraordinary; for I hope you are aware that
there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of
way, or ever dining out at all; and it is what you must not depend upon
ever being repeated. Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is
meant as any particular compliment to _you_; the compliment is intended
to your uncle and aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to
_us_ to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have come
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head, and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia
had been at home, you would not have been asked at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant's part of
the favour, that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could only
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was very much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram for sparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was endeavouring to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's evening work in such a
state as to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being missed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you, or you
would not be allowed to go. _I_ shall be here, so you may be quite easy
about your aunt. And I hope you will have a very _agreeable_ day, and
find it all mighty _delightful_. But I must observe that five is the
very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I
cannot but be surprised that such an _elegant_ lady as Mrs. Grant should
not contrive better! And round their enormous great wide table, too,
which fills up the room so dreadfully! Had the doctor been contented to
take my dining-table when I came away, as anybody in their senses would
have done, instead of having that absurd new one of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own, which is
wider, literally wider than the dinner-table here, how infinitely better
it would have been! and how much more he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would have been respected! for
people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere.
Remember that, Fanny. Five--only five to be sitting round that table.
However, you will have dinner enough on it for ten, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The nonsense and folly of people's stepping out of their rank and
trying to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give _you_
a hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of us;
and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward, and
talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins--as
if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia. _That_ will never do, believe
me. Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and last; and
though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage, you are
not to be taking place of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). And as to coming away at night, you are
to stay just as long as Edmund chuses. Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to settle _that_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am, I should not think of anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely, for I never
saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life, you must manage as
well as you can, and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you. I
certainly do not go home to-night, and, therefore, the carriage will not
be out on my account; so you must make up your mind to what may happen,
and take your things accordingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) niece thought it perfectly reasonable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) rated her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own claims
to comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could; and when Sir Thomas soon
afterwards, just opening the door, said, <div class="bookquote">``Fanny, at what time would you
have the carriage come round?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) felt a degree of astonishment which
made it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Sir Thomas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger, <div class="bookquote">``Fanny can
walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable dignity, and
coming farther into the room. <div class="bookquote">``My niece walk to a dinner engagement at
this time of the year! Will twenty minutes after four suit you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>was Fanny's humble answer, given with the feelings almost
of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris; and not bearing to remain with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
in what might seem a state of triumph, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) uncle out of
the room, having staid behind him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) only long enough to hear these words
spoken in angry agitation--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite unnecessary! a great deal too kind! But Edmund goes; true, it is
upon Edmund's account. I observed he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was hoarse on Thursday night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But this could not impose on Fanny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt that the carriage was for
herself, and herself alone: and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle's consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), coming
immediately after such representations from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) some
tears of gratitude when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was alone.

<p/>The coachman drove round to a minute; another minute brought down the
gentleman; and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of being
late, been many minutes seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them
off in as good time as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own correctly punctual habits required.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I must look at you, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, with the kind smile of an
affectionate brother, <div class="bookquote">``and tell you how I like you; and as well as I can
judge by this light, you look very nicely indeed. What have you got on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>an brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin's
marriage. I hope it is not too fine; but I thought I ought to wear it as
soon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity all
the winter. I hope you do not think me too fine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A woman can never be too fine while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is all in white. No, I see no
finery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper. Your gown seems
very pretty. I like these glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gown
something the same?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard and
coach-house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heyday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``here's company, here's a carriage! who have they
got to meet us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>And letting down the side-glass to distinguish, ```Tis
Crawford's, Crawford's barouche, I protest! There are his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own two men
pushing it back into its old quarters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is here, of course. This is
quite a surprise, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).''

<p/>There was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny to say how very
differently she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt; but the idea of having such another to observe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a great increase of the trepidation with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) performed the
very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.

<p/>In the drawing-room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been just long
enough arrived to be ready for dinner; and the smiles and pleased looks
of the three others standing round him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), shewed how welcome was his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
sudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath.
A very cordial meeting passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) and Edmund; and with the
exception of Fanny, the pleasure was general; and even to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ there
might be some advantage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) presence, since every addition to the
party must rather forward her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) favourite indulgence of being suffered to
sit silent and unattended to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon aware of this herself; for
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must submit, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own propriety of mind directed, in spite
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris's opinion, to being the principal lady in company,
and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found, while
they were at table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not required to take any part--there was so much to be
said between the brother and sister about Bath, so much between the two
young men about hunting, so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and
Dr. Grant, and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford
and Mrs. Grant, as to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) the fairest prospect of having only
to listen in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not
compliment the newly arrived gentleman, however, with any appearance of
interest, in a scheme for extending his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stay at Mansfield, and sending
for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hunters from Norfolk, which, suggested by Dr. Grant, advised by
Edmund, and warmly urged by the two sisters, was soon in possession of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) seemed to want to be encouraged even by her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to
resolve on. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of the
open weather, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) answers were as short and indifferent as civility
allowed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to stay, and would much rather not have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thoughts on
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); but no embarrassing remembrance affected _his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ spirits.
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was again on the same ground where all had passed before, and
apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had never known Mansfield in any other state. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) heard them
spoken of by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) only in a general way, till they were all re-assembled
in the drawing-room, when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter of
business with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them, and
Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea-table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) began talking of them with more
particularity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) other sister. With a significant smile, which made
Fanny quite hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``So! Rushworth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) fair bride are at
Brighton, I understand; happy man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they have been there about a fortnight, Miss Price, have they not?
And Julia is with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Yates, I presume, is not far off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Yates! Oh! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates. I do not imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)
figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park; do you, Miss Price? I
think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) father with Mr.
Yates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Rushworth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) two-and-forty speeches!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>continued Crawford.
<div class="bookquote">``Nobody can ever forget them. Poor fellow! I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) now--his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) toil and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) despair. Well, I am much mistaken if his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) lovely Maria will ever want
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) to make two-and-forty speeches to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; adding, with a momentary
seriousness, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is too good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)--much too good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>And then changing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tone again to one of gentle gallantry, and addressing Fanny, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``You were Mr. Rushworth's best friend. Your kindness and patience
can never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience in trying to make it
possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) to learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) part--in trying to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) a brain
which nature had denied--to mix up an understanding for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) out of the
superfluity of your own! _He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)_ might not have sense enough himself to
estimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it had honour from
all the rest of the party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny coloured, and said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as a dream, a pleasant dream!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) exclaimed, breaking forth
again, after a few minutes' musing. <div class="bookquote">``I shall always look back on our
theatricals with exquisite pleasure. There was such an interest, such an
animation, such a spirit diffused. Everybody felt it. We were all alive.
There was employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every hour of
the day. Always some little objection, some little doubt, some little
anxiety to be got over. I never was happier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>indignation Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Never
happier!--never happier than when doing what you must know was not
justifiable!--never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and
unfeelingly! Oh! what a corrupted mind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>indignation Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were unlucky, Miss Price,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) continued, in a lower tone, to avoid
the possibility of being heard by Edmund, and not at all aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
feelings, <div class="bookquote">``we certainly were very unlucky. Another week, only one other
week, would have been enough for us. I think if we had had the disposal
of events--if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds
just for a week or two, about the equinox, there would have been
a difference. Not that we would have endangered his (<font color='blue'><b>Park</b></font>) safety by any
tremendous weather--but only by a steady contrary wind, or a calm. I
think, Miss Price, we would have indulged ourselves with a week's calm
in the Atlantic at that season.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny, averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face, said,
with a firmer tone than usual, <div class="bookquote">``As far as _I_ am concerned, sir, I would
not have delayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Park</b></font>) return for a day. My uncle disapproved it all so
entirely when he (<font color='blue'><b>Park</b></font>) did arrive, that in my opinion everything had gone
quite far enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never spoken so much at once to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life before, and
never so angrily to any one; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) speech was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) trembled
and blushed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own daring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was surprised; but after a few
moments' silent consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), replied in a calmer, graver tone,
and as if the candid result of conviction, <div class="bookquote">``I believe you are right.
It was more pleasant than prudent. We were getting too noisy.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And
then turning the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would have engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) on some other
subject, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) answers were so shy and reluctant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not
advance in any.

<p/>Miss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund,
now observed, <div class="bookquote">``Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to
discuss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The most interesting in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother--<div class="bookquote">``how to make
money; how to turn a good income into a better. Dr. Grant is giving
Bertram instructions about the living he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) is to step into so soon. I find
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) takes orders in a few weeks. They were at it in the dining-parlour. I
am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) will have a very pretty
income to make ducks and drakes with, and earned without much trouble. I
apprehend he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) will not have less than seven hundred a year. Seven hundred
a year is a fine thing for a younger brother; and as of course he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will
still live at home, it will be all for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) _menus_ _plaisirs_; and a
sermon at Christmas and Easter, I suppose, will be the sum total of
sacrifice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister tried to laugh off her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) feelings by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Nothing amuses me
more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of
those who have a great deal less than themselves. You would look rather
blank, Henry, if your _menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to seven
hundred a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is entirely comparative.
Birthright and habit must settle the business. Bertram is certainly well
off for a cadet of even a baronet's family. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) is four or
five and twenty he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do for
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford _could_ have said that there would be a something to do
and to suffer for it, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not think lightly of; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
checked herself and let it pass; and tried to look calm and unconcerned
when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bertram,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Henry Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``I shall make a point of coming to
Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purpose
to encourage a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will not
you join me in encouraging your cousin? Will not you engage to attend
with your eyes steadily fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) the whole time--as I shall do--not
to lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentence
preeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a
pencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that
Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund;
<div class="bookquote">``for you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more
sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not feel this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>thought Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can feel nothing as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The party talkers</b></font>)</div><p/>The party being now all united, and the chief talkers attracting each
other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) remained in tranquillity; and as a whist-table was formed
after tea--formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
attentive wife, though it was not to be supposed so--and Miss Crawford
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) harp, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had nothing to do but to listen; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) tranquillity
remained undisturbed the rest of the evening, except when Mr. Crawford
now and then addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) a question or observation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could
not avoid answering. Miss Crawford was too much vexed by what had passed
to be in a humour for anything but music. With that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) soothed herself
and amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) friend.

<p/>The assurance of Edmund's being so soon to take orders, coming upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
like a blow that had been suspended, and still hoped uncertain and at a
distance, was felt with resentment and mortification. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was very angry
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) influence more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) _had_ begun to think
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had, with great regard, with almost decided
intentions; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would now meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own cool feelings. It
was plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could have no serious views, no true attachment, by
fixing himself in a situation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must know she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would never
stoop to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would learn to match him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) indifference. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would
henceforth admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attentions without any idea beyond immediate
amusement. If _he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ could so command his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) affections, _hers_ should do her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
no harm.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIV

<p/>Henry Crawford had quite made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind by the next morning to give
another fortnight to Mansfield, and having sent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hunters, and
written a few lines of explanation to the Admiral, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looked round at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sealed and threw the letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and seeing the
coast clear of the rest of the family, said, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``And how do
you think I mean to amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt?
I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week; but I have a
plan for the intermediate days, and what do you think it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To walk and ride with me, to be sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly, though I shall be happy to do both, but _that_ would be
exercise only to my body, and I must take care of my mind. Besides,
_that_ would be all recreation and indulgence, without the wholesome
alloy of labour, and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness. No, my
plan is to make Fanny Price in love with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny Price! Nonsense! No, no. You ought to be satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) two
cousins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a small
hole in Fanny Price's heart. You do not seem properly aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
claims to notice. When we talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) last night, you none of you
seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
looks within the last six weeks. You see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) every day, and therefore do
not notice it; but I assure you she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is quite a different creature from
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in the autumn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was then merely a quiet, modest, not
plain-looking girl, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is now absolutely pretty. I used to think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had neither complexion nor countenance; but in that soft skin of
hers, so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday, there is
decided beauty; and from what I observed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes and mouth, I do
not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
has anything to express. And then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) air, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _tout_
_ensemble_, is so indescribably improved! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must be grown two inches,
at least, since October.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoo! phoo! This is only because there were no tall women to compare
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with, and because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has got a new gown, and you never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so
well dressed before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in October, believe me.
The truth is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was the only girl in company for you to notice,
and you must have a somebody. I have always thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pretty--not
strikingly pretty--but `pretty enough,' as people say; a sort of beauty
that grows on one. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes should be darker, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has a sweet smile;
but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may all
be resolved into a better style of dress, and your having nobody else to
look at; and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), you
never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) beauty, or that
it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother gave only a smile to this accusation, and soon afterwards
said, <div class="bookquote">``I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny. I do not
understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). I could not tell what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be at yesterday. What is
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) character? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) solemn? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) queer? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) prudish? Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
draw back and look so grave at me? I could hardly get her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to speak. I
never was so long in company with a girl in my life, trying to entertain
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and succeed so ill! Never met with a girl who looked so grave on
me! I must try to get the better of this. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks say, `I will not
like you, I am determined not to like you'; and I say she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Foolish fellow! And so this is her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attraction after all! This it is,
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not caring about you, which gives her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) such a soft skin, and makes
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so much taller, and produces all these charms and graces! I do
desire that you will not be making her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really unhappy; a _little_ love,
perhaps, may animate and do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good, but I will not have you plunge
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) deep, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is as good a little creature as ever lived, and has a
great deal of feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can be but for a fortnight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Henry; <div class="bookquote">``and if a fortnight can
kill her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must have a constitution which nothing could save. No, I
will not do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) any harm, dear little soul! only want her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to look kindly
on me, to give me smiles as well as blushes, to keep a chair for me by
herself wherever we are, and be all animation when I take it and talk
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); to think as I think, be interested in all my possessions and
pleasures, try to keep me longer at Mansfield, and feel when I go away
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shall be never happy again. I want nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Moderation itself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``I can have no scruples now. Well, you
will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself,
for we are a great deal together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And without attempting any farther remonstrance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) left Fanny to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fate, a fate which, had not Fanny's heart been guarded in a way
unsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
deserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young
ladies of eighteen -LRB-or one should not read about them-RRB- as are never
to be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent,
manner, attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination to
believe Fanny one of them, or to think that with so much tenderness
of disposition, and so much taste as belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have
escaped heart-whole from the courtship -LRB-though the courtship only of
a fortnight-RRB- of such a man as Crawford, in spite of there being some
previous ill opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be overcome, had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) affection been
engaged elsewhere. With all the security which love of another and
disesteem of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could give to the peace of mind he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was attacking,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued attentions--continued, but not obtrusive, and adapting
themselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
character--obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) very soon to dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) less than formerly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had by no means forgotten the past, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought as ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) as
ever; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) powers: he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was entertaining; and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) manners were
so improved, so polite, so seriously and blamelessly polite, that it was
impossible not to be civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in return.

<p/>A very few days were enough to effect this; and at the end of those few
days, circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
views of pleasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), inasmuch as they gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) a degree of happiness
which must dispose her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to be pleased with everybody. William, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
brother, the so long absent and dearly loved brother, was in England
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) herself, a few hurried happy lines,
written as the ship came up Channel, and sent into Portsmouth with
the first boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead; and when
Crawford walked up with the newspaper in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hand, which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had hoped
would bring the first tidings, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) trembling with joy over this
letter, and listening with a glowing, grateful countenance to the kind
invitation which her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply.

<p/>It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughly
master of the subject, or had in fact become at all aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) having
such a brother, or his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) being in such a ship, but the interest then
excited had been very properly lively, determining him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) return to
town to apply for information as to the probable period of the Antwerp's
return from the Mediterranean, etc.; and the good luck which attended
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) early examination of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as well as
of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dutiful attention to the Admiral, in having for many years
taken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
proved, however, to be too late. All those fine first feelings, of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had hoped to be the exciter, were already given. But his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intention,
the kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intention, was thankfully acknowledged: quite
thankfully and warmly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was elevated beyond the common timidity
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind by the flow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) love for William.

<p/>This dear William would soon be amongst them. There could be no doubt
of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) obtaining leave of absence immediately, for he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was still only a
midshipman; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) parents, from living on the spot, must already
have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and be seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) perhaps daily, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) direct holidays
might with justice be instantly given to the sister, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
best correspondent through a period of seven years, and the uncle who
had done most for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) support and advancement; and accordingly the reply
to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) reply, fixing a very early day for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) arrival, came as soon as
possible; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in
the agitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first dinner-visit, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found herself in an
agitation of a higher nature, watching in the hall, in the lobby, on
the stairs, for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a
brother.

<p/>It came happily while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was thus waiting; and there being neither
ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was with
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) entered the house, and the first minutes of exquisite feeling
had no interruption and no witnesses, unless the servants chiefly intent
upon opening the proper doors could be called such. This was exactly
what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at, as each
proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both
advised Mrs. Norris's continuing where she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was, instead of rushing out
into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them.

<p/>William and Fanny soon shewed themselves; and Sir Thomas had the
pleasure of receiving, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) protege, certainly a very different person
from the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had equipped seven years ago, but a young man of an
open, pleasant countenance, and frank, unstudied, but feeling and
respectful manners, and such as confirmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) friend.

<p/>It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of
such an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation,
and the first of fruition; it was some time even before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness
could be said to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happy, before the disappointment inseparable
from the alteration of person had vanished, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could see in him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) the
same William as before, and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart had been yearning
to do through many a past year. That time, however, did gradually come,
forwarded by an affection on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) side as warm as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own, and much less
encumbered by refinement or self-distrust. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was the first object
of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) love, but it was a love which his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stronger spirits, and bolder
temper, made it as natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to express as to feel. On the
morrow they were walking about together with true enjoyment, and every
succeeding morrow renewed a _tete-a-tete_ which Sir Thomas could not but
observe with complacency, even before Edmund had pointed it out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/>Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or
unlooked-for instance of Edmund's consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in the last few
months had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life,
as in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and
friend who was opening all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heart to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hopes
and fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,
dearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers and
sisters, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very seldom heard; who was interested in all the
comforts and all the little hardships of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home at Mansfield; ready to
think of every member of that home as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) directed, or differing only
by a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of their aunt Norris,
and with whom -LRB-perhaps the dearest indulgence of the whole-RRB- all the evil
and good of their earliest years could be gone over again, and every
former united pain and pleasure retraced with the fondest recollection.
An advantage this, a strengthener of love, in which even the conjugal
tie is beneath the fraternal. Children of the same family, the same
blood, with the same first associations and habits, have some means of
enjoyment in their power, which no subsequent connexions can supply; and
it must be by a long and unnatural estrangement, by a divorce which
no subsequent connexion can justify, if such precious remains of the
earliest attachments are ever entirely outlived. Too often, alas! it is
so. Fraternal love, sometimes almost everything, is at others worse than
nothing. But with William and Fanny Price it was still a sentiment
in all its prime and freshness, wounded by no opposition of interest,
cooled by no separate attachment, and feeling the influence of time and
absence only in its increase.

<p/>An affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who had
hearts to value anything good. Henry Crawford was as much struck with
it as any. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) honoured the warm-hearted, blunt fondness of the young
sailor, which led him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to say, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hands stretched towards Fanny's
head, <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I begin to like that queer fashion already, though
when I first heard of such things being done in England, I could
not believe it; and when Mrs. Brown, and the other women at the
Commissioner's at Gibraltar, appeared in the same trim, I thought they
were mad; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything'' (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>; and saw, with lively
admiration, the glow of Fanny's cheek, the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eye, the
deep interest, the absorbed attention, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother was describing
any of the imminent hazards, or terrific scenes, which such a period at
sea must supply.

<p/>It was a picture which Henry Crawford had moral taste enough to value.
Fanny's attractions increased--increased twofold; for the sensibility
which beautified her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) complexion and illumined her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance was an
attraction in itself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had feeling, genuine feeling. It would be something to
be loved by such a girl, to excite the first ardours of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) young
unsophisticated mind! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had foreseen. A
fortnight was not enough. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) stay became indefinite.

<p/>William was often called on by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uncle to be the talker. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) recitals
were amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas, but the chief object in
seeking them was to understand the reciter, to know the young man by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
histories; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clear, simple, spirited details
with full satisfaction, seeing in them the proof of good principles,
professional knowledge, energy, courage, and cheerfulness, everything
that could deserve or promise well. Young as he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was, William had already
seen a great deal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had been in the Mediterranean; in the West Indies;
in the Mediterranean again; had been often taken on shore by the favour
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) captain, and in the course of seven years had known every variety
of danger which sea and war together could offer. With such means in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) power he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had a right to be listened to; and though Mrs. Norris could
fidget about the room, and disturb everybody in quest of two needlefuls
of thread or a second-hand shirt button, in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nephew's
account of a shipwreck or an engagement, everybody else was attentive;
and even Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved, or
without sometimes lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) work to say, <div class="bookquote">``Dear me! how
disagreeable! I wonder anybody can ever go to sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>To Henry Crawford they gave a different feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) longed to have been
at sea, and seen and done and suffered as much. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart was warmed,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) fancy fired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt the highest respect for a lad who, before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was twenty, had gone through such bodily hardships and given such
proofs of mind. The glory of heroism, of usefulness, of exertion, of
endurance, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful
contrast; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been a William Price, distinguishing
himself and working his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) way to fortune and consequence with so much
self-respect and happy ardour, instead of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was!

<p/>The wish was rather eager than lasting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was roused from the reverie
of retrospection and regret produced by it, by some inquiry from Edmund
as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) plans for the next day's hunting; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) found it was as well
to be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) command.
In one respect it was better, as it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the means of conferring a
kindness where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wished to oblige. With spirits, courage, and curiosity
up to anything, William expressed an inclination to hunt; and Crawford
could mount him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) without the slightest inconvenience to himself, and with
only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas, who knew better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
nephew the value of such a loan, and some alarms to reason away in
Fanny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feared for William; by no means convinced by all that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
could relate of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) own horsemanship in various countries, of the
scrambling parties in which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been engaged, the rough horses and
mules he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had ridden, or his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) many narrow escapes from dreadful falls,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was at all equal to the management of a high-fed hunter in an
English fox-chase; nor till he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) returned safe and well, without accident
or discredit, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) be reconciled to the risk, or feel any of that
obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had fully
intended it should produce. When it was proved, however, to have done
William no harm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could allow it to be a kindness, and even reward
the owner with a smile when the animal was one minute tendered to his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
use again; and the next, with the greatest cordiality, and in a manner
not to be resisted, made over to his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) use entirely so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) remained
in Northamptonshire.

<p/>CHAPTER XXV

<p/>The intercourse of the two families was at this period more nearly
restored to what it had been in the autumn, than any member of the
old intimacy had thought ever likely to be again. The return of Henry
Crawford, and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it,
but much was still owing to Sir Thomas's more than toleration of the
neighbourly attempts at the Parsonage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mind, now disengaged from
the cares which had pressed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) at first, was at leisure to find
the Grants and their young inmates really worth visiting; and though
infinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous
matrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent possibilities
of any one most dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and disdaining even as a littleness the
being quick-sighted on such points, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not avoid perceiving, in
a grand and careless way, that Mr. Crawford was somewhat distinguishing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) niece--nor perhaps refrain -LRB-though unconsciously-RRB- from giving a more
willing assent to invitations on that account.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage, when the
general invitation was at last hazarded, after many debates and many
doubts as to whether it were worth while, <div class="bookquote">``because Sir Thomas seemed
so ill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>proceeded from
good-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr.
Crawford, but as being one in an agreeable group: for it was in the
course of that very visit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) first began to think that any one in
the habit of such idle observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr.
Crawford was the admirer of Fanny Price.

<p/>The meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one, being composed in a
good proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen;
and the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful, according to the usual
style of the Grants, and too much according to the usual habits of
all to raise any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never behold
either the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience, and
who did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the
servants behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) chair, and to bring away some fresh conviction of
its being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.

<p/>In the evening it was found, according to the predetermination of Mrs.
Grant and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister, that after making up the whist-table there would
remain sufficient for a round game, and everybody being as perfectly
complying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are,
speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist; and Lady Bertram
soon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
own choice between the games, and being required either to draw a card
for whist or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) hesitated. Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I do, Sir Thomas? Whist and speculation; which will amuse me
most?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas, after a moment's thought, recommended speculation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was
a whist player himself, and perhaps might feel that it would not much
amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) for a partner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) ladyship's contented answer; <div class="bookquote">``then speculation, if
you please, Mrs. Grant. I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own
equal ignorance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never played the game nor seen it played in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment's indecision again; but upon
everybody's assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) that nothing could be so easy, that it was the
easiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford's stepping forward with a
most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) ladyship and Miss
Price, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.
Norris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime
intellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss Crawford's
direction, were arranged round the other. It was a fine arrangement
for Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hands full of
business, having two persons' cards to manage as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own; for
though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of the
rules of the game in three minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had yet to inspirit her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) play,
sharpen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) avarice, and harden her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart, which, especially in any
competition with William, was a work of some difficulty; and as for Lady
Bertram, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must continue in charge of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) fame and fortune through
the whole evening; and if quick enough to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) from looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
cards when the deal began, must direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) in whatever was to be done
with them to the end of it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in high spirits, doing everything with happy ease, and preeminent
in all the lively turns, quick resources, and playful impudence that
could do honour to the game; and the round table was altogether a very
comfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and orderly silence of the
other.

<p/>Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
lady, but in vain; no pause was long enough for the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) measured
manner needed; and very little of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) state could be known till Mrs.
Grant was able, at the end of the first rubber, to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
compliments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes! very entertaining indeed. A very odd game. I do not know
what it is all about. I am never to see my cards; and Mr. Crawford does
all the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bertram,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the opportunity
of a little languor in the game, <div class="bookquote">``I have never told you what happened to
me yesterday in my ride home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>They had been hunting together, and were
in the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield, when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had been
obliged to give up, and make the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) way back. <div class="bookquote">``I told you I
lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees, because
I can never bear to ask; but I have not told you that, with my usual
luck--for I never do wrong without gaining by it--I found myself in due
time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was suddenly,
upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the midst of
a retired little village between gently rising hills; a small stream
before me to be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to my
right--which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place, and
not a gentleman or half a gentleman's house to be seen excepting one--to
be presumed the Parsonage--within a stone's throw of the said knoll and
church. I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It sounds like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund; <div class="bookquote">``but which way did you turn after
passing Sewell's farm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions; though were I to
answer all that you could put in the course of an hour, you would never
be able to prove that it was _not_ Thornton Lacey--for such it certainly
was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You inquired, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I never inquire. But I _told_ a man mending a hedge that it was
Thornton Lacey, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) agreed to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a good memory. I had forgotten having ever told you half so
much of the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thornton Lacey/Thornton</b></font>)</div><p/>Thornton Lacey was the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) impending living, as Miss Crawford
well knew; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) interest in a negotiation for William Price's knave
increased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>continued Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``and how did you like what you saw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much indeed. You are a lucky fellow. There will be work for five
summers at least before the place is liveable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, not so bad as that. The farmyard must be moved, I grant you;
but I am not aware of anything else. The house is by no means bad, and
when the yard is removed, there may be a very tolerable approach to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The farmyard must be cleared away entirely, and planted up to shut
out the blacksmith's shop. The house must be turned to front the east
instead of the north--the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be
on that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may be
done. And _there_ must be your approach, through what is at present the
garden. You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house;
which will be giving it the best aspect in the world, sloping to the
south-east. The ground seems precisely formed for it. I rode fifty yards
up the lane, between the church and the house, in order to look about
me; and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The meadows
beyond what _will_ _be_ the garden, as well as what now _is_, sweeping
round from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to the
principal road through the village, must be all laid together, of
course; very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber. They
belong to the living, I suppose; if not, you must purchase them. Then
the stream--something must be done with the stream; but I could not
quite determine what. I had two or three ideas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have two or three ideas also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``and one of them is,
that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in
practice. I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty. I
think the house and premises may be made comfortable, and given the air
of a gentleman's residence, without any very heavy expense, and that
must suffice me; and, I hope, may suffice all who care about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone of
voice, and a certain half-look attending the last expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
hope, made a hasty finish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) dealings with William Price; and
securing his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) knave at an exorbitant rate, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``There, I will
stake my last like a woman of spirit. No cold prudence for me. I am not
born to sit still and do nothing. If I lose the game, it shall not be
from not striving for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>knave</b></font>)</div><p/>The game was hers, and only did not pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had given
to secure it. Another deal proceeded, and Crawford began again about
Thornton Lacey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My plan may not be the best possible: I had not many minutes to form
it in; but you must do a good deal. The place deserves it, and you
will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of.
-LRB-Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie
just before you.-RRB- The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving it
the air of a gentleman's residence. _That_ will be done by the removal
of the farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never saw
a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a
gentleman's residence, so much the look of a something above a mere
parsonage-house--above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is
not a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs
as windows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square
farmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as
one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from
generation to generation, through two centuries at least, and were now
spending from two to three thousand a year in.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>Miss Crawford listened,
and Edmund agreed to this. <div class="bookquote">``The air of a gentleman's residence,
therefore, you cannot but give it, if you do anything. But it is capable
of much more. -LRB-Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that
queen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram does not
bid a dozen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.-RRB- By some
such improvements as I have suggested -LRB-I do not really require you to
proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody's striking out
a better-RRB- you may give it a higher character. You may raise it into
a _place_. From being the mere gentleman's residence, it becomes, by
judicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste,
modern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and that
house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the
great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road;
especially as there is no real squire's house to dispute the point--a
circumstance, between ourselves, to enhance the value of such a
situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation.
_You_ think with me, I hope''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning with a softened voice to Fanny-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you ever seen the place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny gave a quick negative, and tried to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) interest in the
subject by an eager attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother, who was driving as hard a
bargain, and imposing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could; but Crawford pursued
with <div class="bookquote">``No, no, you must not part with the queen. You have bought her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) too
dearly, and your brother does not offer half her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) value. No, no, sir,
hands off, hands off. Your sister does not part with the queen. She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) is
quite determined. The game will be yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again; <div class="bookquote">``it
will certainly be yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Fanny had much rather it were William's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, smiling at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Poor Fanny! not allowed to cheat herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wishes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bertram,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``you know
Henry to be such a capital improver, that you cannot possibly engage in
anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) help. Only
think how useful he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) was at Sotherton! Only think what grand things were
produced there by our all going with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) one hot day in August to drive
about the grounds, and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) genius take fire. There we went, and
there we came home again; and what was done there is not to be told!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny's eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment with an expression
more than grave--even reproachful; but on catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), were instantly
withdrawn. With something of consciousness he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) head at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
sister, and laughingly replied, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot say there was much done at
Sotherton; but it was a hot day, and we were all walking after each
other, and bewildered.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>As soon as a general buzz gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) shelter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
added, in a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``I should be sorry to
have my powers of _planning_ judged of by the day at Sotherton. I see
things very differently now. Do not think of me as I appeared then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being just then in the
happy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas's
capital play and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sotherton</b></font>) own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant's great hands,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sotherton</b></font>) called out, in high good-humour, <div class="bookquote">``Sotherton! Yes, that is a place,
indeed, and we had a charming day there. William, you are quite out of
luck; but the next time you come, I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth
will be at home, and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly
received by both. Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their
relations, and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man. They are at Brighton
now, you know; in one of the best houses there, as Mr. Rushworth's fine
fortune gives them a right to be. I do not exactly know the distance,
but when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not very far off, you
ought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I could send a
little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head;
and if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a
smart place as that--poor scrubby midshipman as I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might
depend on, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was stopped by Sir Thomas's saying with authority,
<div class="bookquote">``I do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may
soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters
would be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr.
Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our
family as his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather find him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) private secretary to the First Lord than
anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div>was William's only answer, in an undervoice, not meant
to reach far, and the subject dropped.

<p/>As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford's
behaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second
rubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last
play, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) became a looker-on at the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) niece the
object of attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed
character.

<p/>Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton
Lacey; and not being able to catch Edmund's ear, was detailing it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) scheme was
to rent the house himself the following winter, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) might have a
home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own in that neighbourhood; and it was not merely for the use
of it in the hunting-season -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was then telling her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)-RRB-, though _that_
consideration had certainly some weight, feeling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did that, in
spite of all Dr. Grant's very great kindness, it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) horses to be accommodated where they now were without material
inconvenience; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend
upon one amusement or one season of the year: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heart upon
having a something there that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could come to at any time, a little
homestall at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) command, where all the holidays of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) year might be
spent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) might find himself continuing, improving, and _perfecting_
that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park family which was
increasing in value to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) every day. Sir Thomas heard and was not
offended. There was no want of respect in the young man's address;
and Fanny's reception of it was so proper and modest, so calm and
uninviting, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had nothing to censure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said little,
assented only here and there, and betrayed no inclination either of
appropriating any part of the compliment to herself, or of strengthening
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) views in favour of Northamptonshire. Finding by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was
observed, Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject to Sir
Thomas, in a more everyday tone, but still with feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have, perhaps, heard me
telling Miss Price. May I hope for your acquiescence, and for your not
influencing your son against such a tenant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, <div class="bookquote">``It is the only way, sir, in which
I could _not_ wish you established as a permanent neighbour; but I hope,
and believe, that Edmund will occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own house at Thornton Lacey.
Edmund, am I saying too much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on; but, on
understanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence. But, Crawford, though
I refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend. Consider the house as
half your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own
improved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that
may occur to you this spring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be the losers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>continued Sir Thomas. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) going, though only
eight miles, will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle; but
I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile
himself to doing less. It is perfectly natural that you should not have
thought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford. But a parish has wants and
claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident, and
which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent. Edmund
might, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) might
read prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) might ride
over every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through divine
service; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day,
for three or four hours, if that would content him (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>). But it will not.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can
convey; and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) does not live among his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) parishioners, and prove
himself, by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does
very little either for their good or his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Crawford bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) acquiescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I repeat again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>added Sir Thomas, <div class="bookquote">``that Thornton Lacey is the only
house in the neighbourhood in which I should _not_ be happy to wait on
Mr. Crawford as occupier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Crawford bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thanks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, <div class="bookquote">``undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish
priest. We must hope his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son may prove that _he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)_ knows it too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Whatever effect Sir Thomas's little harangue might really produce on Mr.
Crawford, it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others, two
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) most attentive listeners--Miss Crawford and Fanny. One of
whom, having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so
completely to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) home, was pondering with downcast eyes on what it
would be _not_ to see Edmund every day; and the other, startled from the
agreeable fancies she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been previously indulging on the strength of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother's description, no longer able, in the picture she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
been forming of a future Thornton, to shut out the church, sink the
clergyman, and see only the respectable, elegant, modernised, and
occasional residence of a man of independent fortune, was considering
Sir Thomas, with decided ill-will, as the destroyer of all this, and
suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) character
and manner commanded, and from not daring to relieve herself by a single
attempt at throwing ridicule on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) cause.

<p/>All the agreeable of _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ speculation was over for that hour. It was
time to have done with cards, if sermons prevailed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was glad to
find it necessary to come to a conclusion, and be able to refresh her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
spirits by a change of place and neighbour.

<p/>The chief of the party were now collected irregularly round the
fire, and waiting the final break-up. William and Fanny were the most
detached. They remained together at the otherwise deserted card-table,
talking very comfortably, and not thinking of the rest, till some of the
rest began to think of them. Henry Crawford's chair was the first to be
given a direction towards them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sat silently observing them for a
few minutes; himself, in the meanwhile, observed by Sir Thomas, who was
standing in chat with Dr. Grant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the assembly night,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">``If I were at Portsmouth I
should be at it, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Fanny, that I do not. I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of
dancing too, when I cannot have you. And I do not know that there would
be any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner.
The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a
commission. One might as well be nothing as a midshipman. One _is_
nothing, indeed. You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazing
fine girls, but they will hardly speak to _me_, because Lucy is courted
by a lieutenant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! shame, shame! But never mind it, William''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own cheeks in a
glow of indignation as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``It is not worth minding. It is no
reflection on _you_; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have
all experienced, more or less, in their time. You must think of that,
you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which
fall to every sailor's share, like bad weather and hard living, only
with this advantage, that there will be an end to it, that there will
come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure. When you
are a lieutenant! only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, how
little you will care for any nonsense of this kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny. Everybody gets
made but me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding. My uncle
says nothing, but I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will do everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) power to get
you made. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) knows, as well as you do, of what consequence it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was checked by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle much nearer to them than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had any suspicion of, and each found it necessary to talk of something
else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you fond of dancing, Fanny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very; only I am soon tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance. Have you
never any balls at Northampton? I should like to see you dance, and I'd
dance with you if you _would_, for nobody would know who I was here,
and I should like to be your partner once more. We used to jump about
together many a time, did not we? when the hand-organ was in the street?
I am a pretty good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>And turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) uncle, who was now close to them, <div class="bookquote">``Is not Fanny a
very good dancer, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, in dismay at such an unprecedented question, did not know which
way to look, or how to be prepared for the answer. Some very grave
reproof, or at least the coldest expression of indifference, must be
coming to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother, and sink her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to the ground. But, on the
contrary, it was no worse than, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to say that I am unable
to answer your question. I have never seen Fanny dance since she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a
little girl; but I trust we shall both think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) acquits herself like
a gentlewoman when we do see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), which, perhaps, we may have an
opportunity of doing ere long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance, Mr. Price,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Henry Crawford, leaning forward, <div class="bookquote">``and will engage to answer every
inquiry which you can make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction.
But I believe''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>-LRB-seeing Fanny looked distressed-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``it must be at some
other time. There is _one_ person in company who does not like to have
Miss Price spoken of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>True enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had once seen Fanny dance; and it was equally true
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would now have answered for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gliding about with quiet, light
elegance, and in admirable time; but, in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not for the life
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) recall what her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dancing had been, and rather took it for granted
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been present than remembered anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) passed, however, for an admirer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dancing; and Sir Thomas, by no
means displeased, prolonged the conversation on dancing in general, and
was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and listening to
what his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing which
had fallen within his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) observation, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had not heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) carriage
announced, and was first called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of
Mrs. Norris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about? We are going. Do not you see
your aunt is going? Quick, quick! I cannot bear to keep good old Wilcox
waiting. You should always remember the coachman and horses. My dear Sir
Thomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you,
and Edmund and William.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own arrangement,
previously communicated to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife and sister; but _that_ seemed
forgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) settled it all
herself.

<p/>Fanny's last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawl
which Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford's quicker hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
obliged to be indebted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) more prominent attention.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVI

<p/>William's desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary
impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uncle. The hope of an opportunity, which Sir Thomas
had then given, was not given to be thought of no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) remained
steadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybody
else who might wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the
young people in general; and having thought the matter over, and taken
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) resolution in quiet independence, the result of it appeared the
next morning at breakfast, when, after recalling and commending what
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) nephew had said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I do not like, William, that you
should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence. It would give me
pleasure to see you both dance. You spoke of the balls at Northampton.
Your cousins have occasionally attended them; but they would not
altogether suit us now. The fatigue would be too much for your aunt. I
believe we must not think of a Northampton ball. A dance at home would
be more eligible; and if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear Sir Thomas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mrs. Norris, <div class="bookquote">``I knew what was
coming. I knew what you were going to say. If dear Julia were at home,
or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton, to afford a reason, an occasion
for such a thing, you would be tempted to give the young people a dance
at Mansfield. I know you would. If _they_ were at home to grace the
ball, a ball you would have this very Christmas. Thank your uncle,
William, thank your uncle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My daughters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>replied Sir Thomas, gravely interposing, <div class="bookquote">``have their
pleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy; but the dance which I
think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins. Could we be all
assembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete, but the
absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris had not another word to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) saw decision in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) looks,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) surprise and vexation required some minutes' silence to be
settled into composure. A ball at such a time! His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters absent and
herself not consulted! There was comfort, however, soon at hand. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)_
must be the doer of everything: Lady Bertram would of course be spared
all thought and exertion, and it would all fall upon _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) should
have to do the honours of the evening; and this reflection quickly
restored so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) good-humour as enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to join in with the
others, before their happiness and thanks were all expressed.

<p/>Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speak
as much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could
desire. Edmund's feelings were for the other two. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) father had never
conferred a favour or shewn a kindness more to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) satisfaction.

<p/>Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented, and had no
objections to make. Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) very little
trouble; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was not at all afraid of the
trouble; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) could not imagine there would be any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris was ready with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) suggestions as to the rooms he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would
think fittest to be used, but found it all prearranged; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
would have conjectured and hinted about the day, it appeared that the
day was settled too. Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a
very complete outline of the business; and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) would listen
quietly, could read his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) list of the families to be invited, from whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) calculated, with all necessary allowance for the shortness of the
notice, to collect young people enough to form twelve or fourteen
couple: and could detail the considerations which had induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to
fix on the 22nd as the most eligible day. William was required to be at
Portsmouth on the 24th; the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
visit; but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any
earlier. Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the
same, and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself,
as by far the best day for the purpose.

<p/>The ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening a proclaimed
thing to all whom it concerned. Invitations were sent with despatch,
and many a young lady went to bed that night with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head full of happy
cares as well as Fanny. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the cares were sometimes almost beyond
the happiness; for young and inexperienced, with small means of choice
and no confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own taste, the <div class="bookquote">``how she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) should be dressed''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div>was
a point of painful solicitude; and the almost solitary ornament in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
possession, a very pretty amber cross which William had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from
Sicily, was the greatest distress of all, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nothing but a bit
of ribbon to fasten it to; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had worn it in that manner
once, would it be allowable at such a time in the midst of all the rich
ornaments which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) supposed all the other young ladies would appear in?
And yet not to wear it! William had wanted to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a gold chain too,
but the purchase had been beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) means, and therefore not to wear
the cross might be mortifying him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). These were anxious considerations;
enough to sober her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits even under the prospect of a ball given
principally for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gratification.

<p/>The preparations meanwhile went on, and Lady Bertram continued to sit on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sofa without any inconvenience from them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had some extra visits
from the housekeeper, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) maid was rather hurried in making up a new
dress for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>): Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran about; but
all this gave _her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)_ no trouble, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had foreseen, <div class="bookquote">``there was, in
fact, no trouble in the business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind being
deeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now
at hand, which were to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) fate in life--ordination and
matrimony--events of such a serious character as to make the ball, which
would be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) eyes than in those of any other person in the house. On the 23rd
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was going to a friend near Peterborough, in the same situation
as himself, and they were to receive ordination in the course of the
Christmas week. Half his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) destiny would then be determined, but the
other half might not be so very smoothly wooed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) duties would be
established, but the wife who was to share, and animate, and reward
those duties, might yet be unattainable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
was not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford's. There were
points on which they did not quite agree; there were moments in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
affection, so far as to be resolved--almost resolved--on bringing it to
a decision within a very short time, as soon as the variety of business
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) were arranged, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
had many anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was sometimes very strong; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could
look back on a long course of encouragement, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was as perfect in
disinterested attachment as in everything else. But at other times
doubt and alarm intermingled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hopes; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) decided
preference of a London life, what could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) expect but a determined
rejection? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated,
demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) side as
conscience must forbid.

<p/>The issue of all depended on one question. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) well enough
to forego what had used to be essential points? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) well
enough to make them no longer essential? And this question, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was
continually repeating to himself, though oftenest answered with a <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had sometimes its <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield, and on this circumstance the
<div class="bookquote">``no''  (<font color='red'><b>Mansfield/Mansfield Park</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``yes''  (<font color='red'><b>Mansfield/Mansfield Park</b></font>)</div>had been very recently in alternation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) had seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eyes sparkle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spoke of the dear friend's letter, which claimed
a long visit from her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) in London, and of the kindness of Henry, in
engaging to remain where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was till January, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) might convey her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
thither; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) speak of the pleasure of such a journey with
an animation which had <div class="bookquote">``no''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in every tone. But this had occurred on the
first day of its being settled, within the first hour of the burst of
such enjoyment, when nothing but the friends she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was to visit was before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had since heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) express herself differently, with other
feelings, more chequered feelings: he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) tell Mrs. Grant that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with regret; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) began to believe neither the
friends nor the pleasures she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was going to were worth those she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) left
behind; and that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must go, and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should enjoy
herself when once away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was already looking forward to being at
Mansfield again. Was there not a <div class="bookquote">``yes''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in all this?

<p/>With such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange, Edmund
could not, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own account, think very much of the evening which the
rest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of
strong interest. Independent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) two cousins' enjoyment in it, the
evening was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) of no higher value than any other appointed meeting
of the two families might be. In every meeting there was a hope of
receiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford's attachment; but the
whirl of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable to the
excitement or expression of serious feelings. To engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) early for
the two first dances was all the command of individual happiness which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) power, and the only preparation for the ball which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
could enter into, in spite of all that was passing around him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) on the
subject, from morning till night.

<p/>Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still
unable to satisfy herself as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to wear, determined to
seek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) blameless;
and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had reason
to think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) walked down to the Parsonage
without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion;
and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to
Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own solicitude.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage, just setting
out to call on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and as it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friend, though
obliged to insist on turning back, was unwilling to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
explained her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) business at once, and observed, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be so
kind as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) opinion, it might be all talked over as well without
doors as within. Miss Crawford appeared gratified by the application,
and after a moment's thought, urged Fanny's returning with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in a much
more cordial manner than before, and proposed their going up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
room, where they might have a comfortable coze, without disturbing Dr.
and Mrs. Grant, who were together in the drawing-room. It was just the
plan to suit Fanny; and with a great deal of gratitude on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) side for
such ready and kind attention, they proceeded indoors, and upstairs, and
were soon deep in the interesting subject. Miss Crawford, pleased with
the appeal, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) best judgment and taste, made everything
easy by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) suggestions, and tried to make everything agreeable by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
encouragement. The dress being settled in all its grander parts--<div class="bookquote">``But
what shall you have by way of necklace?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford. <div class="bookquote">``Shall not
you wear your brother's cross?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was undoing a
small parcel, which Fanny had observed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand when they met. Fanny
acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wishes and doubts on this point: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not know
how either to wear the cross, or to refrain from wearing it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
answered by having a small trinket-box placed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and being
requested to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces. Such
had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford was provided, and such the
object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) intended visit: and in the kindest manner she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) now urged
Fanny's taking one for the cross and to keep for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sake, saying
everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could think of to obviate the scruples which were making
Fanny start back at first with a look of horror at the proposal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see what a collection I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``more by half than I ever
use or think of. I do not offer them as new. I offer nothing but an old
necklace. You must forgive the liberty, and oblige me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny still resisted, and from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart. The gift was too valuable. But
Miss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much affectionate
earnestness through all the heads of William and the cross, and the
ball, and herself, as to be finally successful. Fanny found
herself obliged to yield, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might not be accused of pride
or indifference, or some other littleness; and having with modest
reluctance given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) consent, proceeded to make the selection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
looked and looked, longing to know which might be least valuable; and
was determined in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) choice at last, by fancying there was one necklace
more frequently placed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes than the rest. It was of gold,
prettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a longer and a
plainer chain as more adapted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) purpose, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped, in fixing
on this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep. Miss
Crawford smiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) perfect approbation; and hastened to complete the
gift by putting the necklace round her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) see how well
it looked. Fanny had not a word to say against its becomingness, and,
excepting what remained of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) scruples, was exceedingly pleased with
an acquisition so very apropos. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would rather, perhaps, have been
obliged to some other person. But this was an unworthy feeling. Miss
Crawford had anticipated her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wants with a kindness which proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) a
real friend. <div class="bookquote">``When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and feel how very kind you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must think of somebody else too, when you wear that necklace,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Crawford. <div class="bookquote">``You must think of Henry, for it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) choice
in the first place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over
to you all the duty of remembering the original giver. It is to be
a family remembrancer. The sister is not to be in your mind without
bringing the brother too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, in great astonishment and confusion, would have returned the
present instantly. To take what had been the gift of another person,
of a brother too, impossible! it must not be! and with an eagerness
and embarrassment quite diverting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) companion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) laid down the
necklace again on its cotton, and seemed resolved either to take another
or none at all. Miss Crawford thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had never seen a prettier
consciousness. <div class="bookquote">``My dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), laughing, <div class="bookquote">``what are you afraid
of? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine, and fancy you
did not come honestly by it? or are you imagining he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would be too much
flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) money
purchased three years ago, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knew there was such a throat in the
world? or perhaps'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--looking archly--<div class="bookquote">``you suspect a confederacy between
us, and that what I am now doing is with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knowledge and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
desire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>With the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Crawford more seriously, but without at all
believing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to convince me that you suspect no trick, and are as
unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you, take the necklace
and say no more about it. Its being a gift of my brother's need not make
the smallest difference in your accepting it, as I assure you it makes
none in my willingness to part with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is always giving me something
or other. I have such innumerable presents from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that it is quite
impossible for me to value or for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to remember half. And as for this
necklace, I do not suppose I have worn it six times: it is very pretty,
but I never think of it; and though you would be most heartily welcome
to any other in my trinket-box, you have happened to fix on the very
one which, if I have a choice, I would rather part with and see in your
possession than any other. Say no more against it, I entreat you. Such a
trifle is not worth half so many words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with renewed but less
happy thanks accepted the necklace again, for there was an expression in
Miss Crawford's eyes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not be satisfied with.

<p/>It was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to be insensible of Mr. Crawford's change of
manners. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had long seen it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) evidently tried to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
gallant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was attentive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was something like what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
cousins: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wanted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) supposed, to cheat her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) tranquillity as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had cheated them; and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might not have some concern in this
necklace--she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not be convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had not, for Miss Crawford,
complaisant as a sister, was careless as a woman and a friend.

<p/>Reflecting and doubting, and feeling that the possession of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
so much wished for did not bring much satisfaction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) now walked
home again, with a change rather than a diminution of cares since her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
treading that path before.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVII

<p/>On reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this
unexpected acquisition, this doubtful good of a necklace, in some
favourite box in the East room, which held all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) smaller treasures;
but on opening the door, what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) surprise to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cousin Edmund
there writing at the table! Such a sight having never occurred before,
was almost as wonderful as it was welcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) directly, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) seat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) pen, and meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
with something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon for being here. I came
to look for you, and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming
in, was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand. You will find
the beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now speak my business,
which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle--a chain
for William's cross. You ought to have had it a week ago, but there has
been a delay from my brother's not being in town by several days so soon
as I expected; and I have only just now received it at Northampton. I
hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny. I endeavoured to consult the
simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate, I know you will be kind to
my intentions, and consider it, as it really is, a token of the love of
one of your oldest friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was hurrying away, before Fanny, overpowered by a
thousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; but
quickened by one sovereign wish, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) then called out, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! cousin, stop
a moment, pray stop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) turned back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot attempt to thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) continued, in a very agitated
manner; <div class="bookquote">``thanks are out of the question. I feel much more than I can
possibly express. Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is
beyond--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that is all you have to say, Fanny''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>smiling and turning away again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, it is not. I want to consult you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Almost unconsciously she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had now undone the parcel he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had just put
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and seeing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in all the niceness of jewellers'
packing, a plain gold chain, perfectly simple and neat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not
help bursting forth again, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, this is beautiful indeed! This is the
very thing, precisely what I wished for! This is the only ornament I
have ever had a desire to possess. It will exactly suit my cross. They
must and shall be worn together. It comes, too, in such an acceptable
moment. Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much. I am most
happy that you like the chain, and that it should be here in time for
to-morrow; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion. Believe me, I
have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours.
No, I can safely say, I have no pleasure so complete, so unalloyed. It
is without a drawback.''

 (<font color='red'><b>affection Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour
without saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment, obliged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to bring down her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind from its heavenly flight by saying, <div class="bookquote">``But what
is it that you want to consult me about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It was about the necklace, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was now most earnestly longing to
return, and hoped to obtain his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) approbation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gave the
history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recent visit, and now her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) raptures might well be over;
for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what
Miss Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct
between them, that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one
pleasure over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own mind, though it might have its drawback. It was
some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could get his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) plan, or any answer
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) demand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) opinion: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was in a reverie of fond reflection,
uttering only now and then a few half-sentences of praise; but when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did awake and understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was very decided in opposing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
wished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Return the necklace! No, my dear Fanny, upon no account. It would be
mortifying her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) severely. There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation
than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with
a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend. Why
should she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lose a pleasure which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has shewn herself so deserving of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it had been given to me in the first instance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``I
should not have thought of returning it; but being her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother's
present, is not it fair to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would rather not part with
it, when it is not wanted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and its
having been originally her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother's gift makes no difference; for as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not prevented from offering, nor you from taking it on that
account, it ought not to prevent you from keeping it. No doubt it is
handsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its way, and, for
my purpose, not half so fit. The chain will agree with William's cross
beyond all comparison better than the necklace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_ a sacrifice; I am
sure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than give
pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort. Miss Crawford's
attentions to you have been--not more than you were justly entitled
to--I am the last person to think that _could_ _be_, but they have been
invariable; and to be returning them with what must have something the
_air_ of ingratitude, though I know it could never have the _meaning_,
is not in your nature, I am sure. Wear the necklace, as you are engaged
to do, to-morrow evening, and let the chain, which was not ordered with
any reference to the ball, be kept for commoner occasions. This is my
advice. I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose
intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure, and in whose
characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity
and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences, resulting
principally from situation, no reasonable hindrance to a perfect
friendship. I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
repeated, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) voice sinking a little, <div class="bookquote">``between the two dearest objects I
have on earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was gone as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) two dearest--that must support her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). But
the other: the first! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) speak so openly before,
and though it told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) no more than what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had long perceived, it was
a stab, for it told of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own convictions and views. They were
decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would marry Miss Crawford. It was a stab, in spite of every
long-standing expectation; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was obliged to repeat again and
again, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) two dearest, before the words gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
any sensation. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) believe Miss Crawford to deserve him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), it would
be--oh, how different would it be--how far more tolerable! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was
deceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) merits which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had not; her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) faults were
what they had ever been, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw them no longer. Till she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had shed
many tears over this deception, Fanny could not subdue her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) agitation;
and the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the influence
of fervent prayers for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) happiness.

<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) intention, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) duty, to try to overcome
all that was excessive, all that bordered on selfishness, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
affection for Edmund. To call or to fancy it a loss, a disappointment,
would be a presumption for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not words strong enough to
satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own humility. To think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) as Miss Crawford might be
justified in thinking, would in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) be insanity. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could be
nothing under any circumstances; nothing dearer than a friend. Why did
such an idea occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) even enough to be reprobated and forbidden? It
ought not to have touched on the confines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would
endeavour to be rational, and to deserve the right of judging of Miss
Crawford's character, and the privilege of true solicitude for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) by a
sound intellect and an honest heart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had all the heroism of principle, and was determined to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) duty;
but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) not
be much wondered at, if, after making all these good resolutions on the
side of self-government, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund
had begun writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as a treasure beyond all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hopes, and
reading with the tenderest emotion these words, <div class="bookquote">``My very dear Fanny,
you must do me the favour to accept''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>locked it up with the chain, as the
dearest part of the gift. It was the only thing approaching to a letter
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had ever received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might never receive another;
it was impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) ever should receive another so perfectly
gratifying in the occasion and the style. Two lines more prized had
never fallen from the pen of the most distinguished author--never
more completely blessed the researches of the fondest biographer. The
enthusiasm of a woman's love is even beyond the biographer's. To her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
the handwriting itself, independent of anything it may convey, is a
blessedness. Never were such characters cut by any other human being as
Edmund's commonest handwriting gave! This specimen, written in haste
as it was, had not a fault; and there was a felicity in the flow of the
first four words, in the arrangement of <div class="bookquote">``My very dear Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
could have looked at for ever.

<p/>Having regulated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts and comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings by this happy
mixture of reason and weakness, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was able in due time to go down
and resume her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual employments near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt Bertram, and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the
usual observances without any apparent want of spirits.

<p/>Thursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened with
more kindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days often
volunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought
from Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) found himself obliged
to go to London on the morrow for a few days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not help trying
to procure a companion; and therefore hoped that if William could
make up his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been
proposed, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would accept a place in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) carriage. Mr. Crawford meant to
be in town by his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle's accustomary late dinner-hour, and William
was invited to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) at the Admiral's. The proposal was a very
pleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling post
with four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and, in
likening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once everything
in favour of its happiness and dignity which his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) imagination could
suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly pleased;
for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from
Northampton the following night, which would not have allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) an
hour's rest before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and though
this offer of Mr. Crawford's would rob her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) of many hours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) company,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such
a journey, to think of anything else. Sir Thomas approved of it for
another reason. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) nephew's introduction to Admiral Crawford might be
of service. The Admiral, he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) believed, had interest. Upon the whole, it
was a very joyous note. Fanny's spirits lived on it half the morning,
deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go
away.

<p/>As for the ball, so near at hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had too many agitations and fears
to have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to have had,
or must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking
forward to the same event in situations more at ease, but under
circumstances of less novelty, less interest, less peculiar
gratification, than would be attributed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Miss Price, known
only by name to half the people invited, was now to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) first
appearance, and must be regarded as the queen of the evening. Who could
be happier than Miss Price? But Miss Price had not been brought up to
the trade of _coming_ _out_; and had she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) known in what light this ball
was, in general, considered respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), it would very much have
lessened her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) comfort by increasing the fears she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) already had of doing
wrong and being looked at. To dance without much observation or any
extraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half the
evening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.
Crawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) aunt Norris, was the height of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) ambition, and seemed to
comprehend her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) greatest possibility of happiness. As these were the best
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of a long
morning, spent principally with her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) two aunts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was often under the
influence of much less sanguine views. William, determined to make this
last day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting; Edmund,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and left
alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because the
housekeeper would have her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) own way with the supper, and whom _she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)_ could
not avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at last to
think everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent off with
a parting worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own room, and
felt as incapable of happiness as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been allowed no share in
it.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walked slowly upstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought of yesterday; it had been
about the same hour that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had returned from the Parsonage, and
found Edmund in the East room. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose I were to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) there again
to-day!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said a voice at that moment near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Starting and looking up,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw, across the lobby she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had just reached, Edmund himself, standing
at the head of a different staircase. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You look
tired and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have not been out at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You had
better have gone out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make no answer; and
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) usual kindness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
soon ceased to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not appear in spirits:
something unconnected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was probably amiss. They proceeded
upstairs together, their rooms being on the same floor above.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come from Dr. Grant's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund presently. <div class="bookquote">``You may guess my
errand there, Fanny.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) looked so conscious, that Fanny could think
but of one errand, which turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) too sick for speech. <div class="bookquote">``I wished to
engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>was the explanation that
followed, and brought Fanny to life again, enabling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was expected to speak, to utter something like an inquiry as to the
result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is engaged to me; but''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a smile that did
not sit easy-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) says it is to be the last time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) ever will
dance with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is not serious. I think, I hope, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is
not serious; but I would rather not hear it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) never has danced with a
clergyman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) says, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) never _will_. For my own sake, I could wish
there had been no ball just at--I mean not this very week, this very
day; to-morrow I leave home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny struggled for speech, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry that anything has
occurred to distress you. This ought to be a day of pleasure. My uncle
meant it so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure. It will all end right. I
am only vexed for a moment. In fact, it is not that I consider the ball
as ill-timed; what does it signify? But, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), by taking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and speaking low and seriously, <div class="bookquote">``you know what all this means.
You see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tell
you, how and why I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little. You are a
kind, kind listener. I have been pained by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) manner this morning, and
cannot get the better of it. I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) disposition to be as sweet and
faultless as your own, but the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) former companions
makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seem--gives to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conversation, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) professed opinions,
sometimes a tinge of wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not _think_ evil, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) speaks
it, speaks it in playfulness; and though I know it to be playfulness, it
grieves me to the soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The effect of education,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny gently.

<p/>Edmund could not but agree to it. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, that uncle and aunt! They have
injured the finest mind; for sometimes, Fanny, I own to you, it does
appear more than manner: it appears as if the mind itself was tainted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) judgment, and therefore,
after a moment's consideration, said, <div class="bookquote">``If you only want me as a
listener, cousin, I will be as useful as I can; but I am not qualified
for an adviser. Do not ask advice of _me_. I am not competent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office, but you need
not be afraid. It is a subject on which I should never ask advice; it
is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked; and few,
I imagine, do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against their
conscience. I only want to talk to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One thing more. Excuse the liberty; but take care _how_ you talk to me.
Do not tell me anything now, which hereafter you may be sorry for. The
time may come--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The colour rushed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest Fanny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Edmund, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) lips with
almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford's, <div class="bookquote">``you are all
considerate thought! But it is unnecessary here. The time will never
come. No such time as you allude to will ever come. I begin to think it
most improbable: the chances grow less and less; and even if it should,
there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need
be afraid of, for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if they
are removed, it must be by changes that will only raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) character
the more by the recollection of the faults she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) once had. You are the
only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said; but you
have always known my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); you can bear me witness, Fanny,
that I have never been blinded. How many a time have we talked over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) little errors! You need not fear me; I have almost given up every
serious idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); but I must be a blockhead indeed, if, whatever
befell me, I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the
sincerest gratitude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had said
enough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had lately known,
and with a brighter look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, cousin, I am convinced
that _you_ would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some
might not. I cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say. Do
not check yourself. Tell me whatever you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now on the second floor, and the appearance of a housemaid
prevented any farther conversation. For Fanny's present comfort it was
concluded, perhaps, at the happiest moment: had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) been able to talk
another five minutes, there is no saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) might not have talked
away all Miss Crawford's faults and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own despondence. But as it was,
they parted with looks on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) side of grateful affection, and with
some very precious sensations on hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had felt nothing like it for
hours. Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford's note to William had worn
away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had been
no comfort around, no hope within her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Now everything was smiling.
William's good fortune returned again upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind, and seemed of
greater value than at first. The ball, too--such an evening of pleasure
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)! It was now a real animation; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) began to dress for it
with much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball. All went well:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own looks; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) came to the necklaces
again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had, to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too large for
the purpose. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), therefore, must be worn; and having, with delightful
feelings, joined the chain and the cross--those memorials of the two
most beloved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart, those dearest tokens so formed for each other
by everything real and imaginary--and put them round her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) neck, and seen
and felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was able, without
an effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford's necklace too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
acknowledged it to be right. Miss Crawford had a claim; and when it was
no longer to encroach on, to interfere with the stronger claims, the
truer kindness of another, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could do her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) justice even with pleasure
to herself. The necklace really looked very well; and Fanny left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
room at last, comfortably satisfied with herself and all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram had recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) on this occasion with an unusual
degree of wakefulness. It had really occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), unprompted, that
Fanny, preparing for a ball, might be glad of better help than the upper
housemaid's, and when dressed herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) actually sent her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) own maid to
assist her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>); too late, of course, to be of any use. Mrs. Chapman had just
reached the attic floor, when Miss Price came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) room completely
dressed, and only civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's
attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do
themselves.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) uncle and both her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) aunts were in the drawing-room when Fanny went
down. To the former she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was an interesting object, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) saw with
pleasure the general elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appearance, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being in
remarkably good looks. The neatness and propriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dress was all
that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would allow himself to commend in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) presence, but upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
leaving the room again soon afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) beauty with very
decided praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looks very well. I sent Chapman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look well! Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Norris, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) has good reason to look
well with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) advantages: brought up in this family as she (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) has been,
with all the benefit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) cousins' manners before her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>). Only think, my
dear Sir Thomas, what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the
means of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>). The very gown you have been taking notice of is
your own generous present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) when dear Mrs. Rushworth married. What
would she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) have been if we had not taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) by the hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas said no more; but when they sat down to table the eyes of
the two young men assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that the subject might be gently touched
again, when the ladies withdrew, with more success. Fanny saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) look still
better. From a variety of causes she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was happy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon made
still happier; for in following her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunts out of the room, Edmund, who
was holding open the door, said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You must dance
with me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,
except the first.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nothing more to wish for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hardly
ever been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
cousins' former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it to be indeed very charming, and was actually practising
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) steps about the drawing-room as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could be safe from the
notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris, who was entirely taken up at first in fresh
arranging and injuring the noble fire which the butler had prepared.

<p/>Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid under any
other circumstances, but Fanny's happiness still prevailed. It was but
to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessness
of Mrs. Norris? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?

<p/>The gentlemen joined them; and soon after began the sweet expectation of
a carriage, when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed diffused,
and they all stood about and talked and laughed, and every moment had
its pleasure and its hope. Fanny felt that there must be a struggle
in Edmund's cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the effort so
successfully made.

<p/>When the carriages were really heard, when the guests began really to
assemble, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own gaiety of heart was much subdued: the sight of so
many strangers threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) back into herself; and besides the gravity and
formality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither Sir
Thomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) found herself
occasionally called on to endure something worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was introduced
here and there by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) uncle, and forced to be spoken to, and to curtsey,
and speak again. This was a hard duty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was never summoned to
it without looking at William, as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) walked about at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) ease in the
background of the scene, and longing to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch. The
stiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and
more diffused intimacies: little groups were formed, and everybody grew
comfortable. Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils
of civility, would have been again most happy, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ looked all
loveliness--and what might not be the end of it? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own musings
were brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts were put into another channel by his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) almost
instantly for the first two dances. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness on this occasion was
very much _a_ _la_ _mortal_, finely chequered. To be secure of a partner
at first was a most essential good--for the moment of beginning was now
growing seriously near; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so little understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own claims as
to think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have been the
last to be sought after, and should have received a partner only through
a series of inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would have been
terrible; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) manner of
asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not like, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eye glancing for
a moment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) necklace, with a smile--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought there was a
smile--which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) blush and feel wretched. And though there was no
second glance to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), though his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) object seemed then to be only
quietly agreeable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not get the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) embarrassment,
heightened as it was by the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) perceiving it, and had no
composure till he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) turned away to some one else. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could gradually
rise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a partner, a voluntary
partner, secured against the dancing began.

<p/>When the company were moving into the ballroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found herself
for the first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles were
immediately and more unequivocally directed as her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother's had been,
and who was beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxious
to get the story over, hastened to give the explanation of the second
necklace: the real chain. Miss Crawford listened; and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) intended
compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt only one
thing; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could
yet be brighter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) exclaimed with eager pleasure, <div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)? Did Edmund?
That was like himself. No other man would have thought of it. I honour
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beyond expression.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked around as if longing to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
so. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not near, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was attending a party of ladies out of the room;
and Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm of each,
they followed with the rest.

<p/>Fanny's heart sunk, but there was no leisure for thinking long even of
Miss Crawford's feelings. They were in the ballroom, the violins were
playing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on
anything serious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must watch the general arrangements, and see how
everything was done.

<p/>In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) were engaged;
and the <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had intended
to hear. Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),
saying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ was to lead the
way and open the ball; an idea that had never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) before.
Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had thought of the minutiae of the evening, it had been as
a matter of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford; and the
impression was so strong, that though _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ _uncle_ spoke the contrary,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not help an exclamation of surprise, a hint of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) unfitness,
an entreaty even to be excused. To be urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) opinion against Sir
Thomas's was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
horror at the first suggestion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could actually look him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in
the face and say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped it might be settled otherwise; in vain,
however: Sir Thomas smiled, tried to encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and then looked too
serious, and said too decidedly, <div class="bookquote">``It must be so, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to
hazard another word; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) found herself the next moment conducted by
Mr. Crawford to the top of the room, and standing there to be joined by
the rest of the dancers, couple after couple, as they were formed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could hardly believe it. To be placed above so many elegant young
women! The distinction was too great. It was treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) like her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
cousins! And her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thoughts flew to those absent cousins with most
unfeigned and truly tender regret, that they were not at home to take
their own place in the room, and have their share of a pleasure which
would have been so very delightful to them. So often as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had heard
them wish for a ball at home as the greatest of all felicities! And
to have them away when it was given--and for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ to be opening the
ball--and with Mr. Crawford too! She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped they would not envy her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that
distinction _now_; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looked back to the state of things in
the autumn, to what they had all been to each other when once dancing
in that house before, the present arrangement was almost more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
could understand herself.

<p/>The ball began. It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny, for the
first dance at least: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) partner was in excellent spirits, and tried to
impart them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a great deal too much frightened to have
any enjoyment till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could suppose herself no longer looked at. Young,
pretty, and gentle, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no awkwardnesses that were not
as good as graces, and there were few persons present that were not
disposed to praise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was attractive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was modest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was Sir
Thomas's niece, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford. It
was enough to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) general favour. Sir Thomas himself was watching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) progress down the dance with much complacency; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
niece; and without attributing all her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris
seemed to do, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) transplantation to Mansfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was pleased with
himself for having supplied everything else: education and manners she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
owed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>).

<p/>Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas's thoughts as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stood, and having,
in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wrongs towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), a general prevailing desire of
recommending herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), took an opportunity of stepping aside to
say something agreeable of Fanny. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) praise was warm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
received it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could wish, joining in it as far as discretion, and
politeness, and slowness of speech would allow, and certainly appearing
to greater advantage on the subject than his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) lady did soon afterwards,
when Mary, perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) on a sofa very near, turned round before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
began to dance, to compliment her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) on Miss Price's looks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does look very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>was Lady Bertram's placid reply.
<div class="bookquote">``Chapman helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) to dress. I sent Chapman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Not but that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was really pleased to have Fanny admired; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was so much more
struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own kindness in sending Chapman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
not get it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head.

<p/>Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_
by commendation of Fanny; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), it was as the occasion offered--<div class="bookquote">``Ah!
ma’am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and
Mrs. Norris paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) with as many smiles and courteous words as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had
time for, amid so much occupation as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) found for herself in making
up card-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas, and trying to move all the
chaperons to a better part of the room.

<p/>Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) intentions
to please. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meant to be giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) little heart a happy flutter,
and filling her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and,
misinterpreting Fanny's blushes, still thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must be doing so when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) after the two first dances, and said, with a significant
look, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother goes to town to-morrow?
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has business there, but will not tell me what. The first time
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever denied me his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) confidence! But this is what we all come to.
All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply to you for
information. Pray, what is Henry going for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny protested her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ignorance as steadily as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) embarrassment allowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Crawford, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``I must suppose it to be
purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of you
by the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent; while Miss
Crawford wondered she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not smile, and thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) over-anxious,
or thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) odd, or thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) anything rather than insensible of
pleasure in Henry's attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in
the course of the evening; but Henry's attentions had very little to
do with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would much rather _not_ have been asked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) again so
very soon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not been obliged to suspect that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for
the sake of securing her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) at that part of the evening. But it was not to
be avoided: he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was the object of all; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
could not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy
or ostentation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) manner; and sometimes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) talked of William,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart
which did him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) credit. But still his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) attentions made no part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
satisfaction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was happy whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) looked at William, and saw how
perfectly he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could
walk about with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and hear his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) account of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) partners; she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was happy
in knowing herself admired; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was happy in having the two dances
with Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest part of the
evening, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) hand being so eagerly sought after that her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) indefinite
engagement with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ was in continual perspective. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was happy even
when they did take place; but not from any flow of spirits on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) side,
or any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind was fagged, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) happiness sprung from being the friend with
whom it could find repose. <div class="bookquote">``I am worn out with civility,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
have been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say. But
with _you_, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not want to be talked
to. Let us have the luxury of silence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>Fanny would hardly even speak
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) agreement. A weariness, arising probably, in great measure, from the
same feelings which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had acknowledged in the morning, was peculiarly
to be respected, and they went down their two dances together with such
sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on that Sir Thomas had
been bringing up no wife for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) younger son.

<p/>The evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure. Miss Crawford had
been in gay spirits when they first danced together, but it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
gaiety that could do him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) good: it rather sank than raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) comfort;
and afterwards, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) found himself still impelled to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had absolutely pained him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) manner of speaking of the
profession to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was now on the point of belonging. They had
talked, and they had been silent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had reasoned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had ridiculed;
and they had parted at last with mutual vexation. Fanny, not able to
refrain entirely from observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably
satisfied. It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering. Yet
some happiness must and would arise from the very conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did
suffer.

<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) two dances with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) were over, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) inclination and strength for
more were pretty well at an end; and Sir Thomas, having seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walk
rather than dance down the shortening set, breathless, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) side, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) orders for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sitting down entirely. From that
time Mr. Crawford sat down likewise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Fanny!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div>cried William, coming for a moment to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and
working away his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) partner's fan as if for life, <div class="bookquote">``how soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is knocked
up! Why, the sport is but just begun. I hope we shall keep it up these
two hours. How can you be tired so soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>partner fan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So soon! my good friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, producing his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) watch with all
necessary caution; <div class="bookquote">``it is three o’clock, and your sister is not used to
these sort of hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go. Sleep as
long as you can, and never mind me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! William.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) think of being up before you set off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, rising eagerly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat to be nearer
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle; <div class="bookquote">``I must get up and breakfast with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). It will be the last
time, you know; the last morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better not. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is to have breakfasted and be gone by half-past
nine. Mr. Crawford, I think you call for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at half-past nine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was too urgent, however, and had too many tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes for
denial; and it ended in a gracious <div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>which was permission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, half-past nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Crawford to William as the latter was
leaving them, <div class="bookquote">``and I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind sister
to get up for _me_.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div>And in a lower tone to Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``I shall have only
a desolate house to hurry from. Your brother will find my ideas of time
and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own very different to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the early
breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should himself
be of it; and the readiness with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) invitation was accepted
convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that the suspicions whence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must confess to himself,
this very ball had in great measure sprung, were well founded. Mr.
Crawford was in love with Fanny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had a pleasing anticipation of what
would be. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) niece, meanwhile, did not thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had just
done. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had hoped to have William all to herself the last morning. It
would have been an unspeakable indulgence. But though her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) wishes
were overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring within her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>). On the
contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was so totally unused to have her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) pleasure consulted, or
to have anything take place at all in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) could desire, that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
was more disposed to wonder and rejoice in having carried her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) point so
far, than to repine at the counteraction which followed.

<p/>Shortly afterward, Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
inclination, by advising her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to go immediately to bed. <div class="bookquote">``Advise''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
word, but it was the advice of absolute power, and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had only to
rise, and, with Mr. Crawford's very cordial adieus, pass quietly away;
stopping at the entrance-door, like the Lady of Branxholm Hall, <div class="bookquote">``one
moment and no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lady</b></font>)</div>to view the happy scene, and take a last look at
the five or six determined couple who were still hard at work; and then,
creeping slowly up the principal staircase, pursued by the ceaseless
country-dance, feverish with hopes and fears, soup and negus,
sore-footed and fatigued, restless and agitated, yet feeling, in spite
of everything, that a ball was indeed delightful.

<p/>In thus sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking
merely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) health. It might occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that Mr. Crawford had been
sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) long enough, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might mean to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) as a wife
by shewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) persuadableness.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIX

<p/>The ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kiss
was given, and William was gone. Mr. Crawford had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) foretold, been
very punctual, and short and pleasant had been the meal.

<p/>After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the
breakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy
change; and there her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle kindly left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to cry in peace, conceiving,
perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in
William's plate might but divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings with the broken egg-shells
in Mr. Crawford's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat and cried _con_ _amore_ as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle
intended, but it was _con_ _amore_ fraternal and no other. William was
gone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had wasted half his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) visit in idle cares
and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>Fanny's disposition was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could never even think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own small house,
without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
when they had been last together; much less could her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings acquit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) of having done and said and thought everything by William that was
due to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for a whole fortnight.

<p/>It was a heavy, melancholy day. Soon after the second breakfast, Edmund
bade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) horse for Peterborough,
and then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but remembrances,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nobody to share in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
must talk to somebody of the ball; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt had seen so little of
what had passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was heavy work.
Lady Bertram was not certain of anybody's dress or anybody's place at
supper but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could not recollect what it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had
heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was that Lady Prescott
had noticed in Fanny: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been
talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was the finest
young man in the room--somebody had whispered something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And these were her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) longest
speeches and clearest communications: the rest was only a languid <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
yes; very well; did you? did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)? I did not see _that_; I should not know
one from the other.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was very bad. It was only better than Mrs.
Norris's sharp answers would have been; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) being gone home with
all the supernumerary jellies to nurse a sick maid, there was peace
and good-humour in their little party, though it could not boast much
beside.

<p/>The evening was heavy like the day. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot think what is the matter
with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram, when the tea-things were removed. <div class="bookquote">``I feel
quite stupid. It must be sitting up so late last night. Fanny, you must
do something to keep me awake. I cannot work. Fetch the cards; I feel so
very stupid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>The cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt till
bedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds were
heard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the
game--<div class="bookquote">``And _that_ makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib. You
are to deal, ma’am; shall I deal for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>Fanny thought and thought
again of the difference which twenty-four hours had made in that room,
and all that part of the house. Last night it had been hope and smiles,
bustle and motion, noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room, and out
of the drawing-room, and everywhere. Now it was languor, and all but
solitude.

<p/>A good night's rest improved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could think of William the
next day more cheerfully; and as the morning afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) an opportunity
of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford, in a
very handsome style, with all the heightenings of imagination, and
all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a
departed ball, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could afterwards bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind without much effort
into its everyday state, and easily conform to the tranquillity of the
present quiet week.

<p/>They were indeed a smaller party than she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had ever known there for
a whole day together, and _he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ was gone on whom the comfort and
cheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended.
But this must be learned to be endured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would soon be always gone;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was thankful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could now sit in the same room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
uncle, hear his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) voice, receive his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) questions, and even answer them,
without such wretched feelings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had formerly known.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We miss our two young men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>was Sir Thomas's observation on both the
first and second day, as they formed their very reduced circle after
dinner; and in consideration of Fanny's swimming eyes, nothing more was
said on the first day than to drink their good health; but on the
second it led to something farther. William was kindly commended and
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) promotion hoped for. <div class="bookquote">``And there is no reason to suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>added Sir
Thomas, <div class="bookquote">``but that his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) visits to us may now be tolerably frequent. As to
Edmund, we must learn to do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). This will be the last winter of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) belonging to us, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) has done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram, <div class="bookquote">``but I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was not going away. They are
all going away, I think. I wish they would stay at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>This wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied for
permission to go to town with Maria; and as Sir Thomas thought it best
for each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram,
though in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own good-nature she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would not have prevented it, was
lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia's return, which
would otherwise have taken place about this time. A great deal of good
sense followed on Sir Thomas's side, tending to reconcile his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife to
the arrangement. Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feel
was advanced for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) use; and everything that an affectionate mother
_must_ feel in promoting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) children's enjoyment was attributed to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
nature. Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm <div class="bookquote">``Yes'' (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>; and at the end
of a quarter of an hour's silent consideration spontaneously observed,
<div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas, I have been thinking--and I am very glad we took Fanny as
we did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding, <div class="bookquote">``Very true.
We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) by praising her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is now a very valuable companion. If we have been kind to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
is now quite as necessary to _us_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram presently; <div class="bookquote">``and it is a comfort to think that
we shall always have _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, and then gravely
replied, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other
home that may reasonably promise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) greater happiness than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knows
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who should invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)?
Maria might be very glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) at Sotherton now and then, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
would not think of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to live there; and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is better
off here; and besides, I cannot do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>a character</b></font>)</div><p/>The week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the great house in
Mansfield had a very different character at the Parsonage. To the young
lady, at least, in each family, it brought very different feelings. What
was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation to
Mary. Something arose from difference of disposition and habit: one so
easily satisfied, the other so unused to endure; but still more might be
imputed to difference of circumstances. In some points of interest they
were exactly opposed to each other. To Fanny's mind, Edmund's absence
was really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief. To Mary it was
every way painful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt the want of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) society every day, almost
every hour, and was too much in want of it to derive anything but
irritation from considering the object for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not
have devised anything more likely to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) consequence than this
week's absence, occurring as it did at the very time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother's
going away, of William Price's going too, and completing the sort of
general break-up of a party which had been so animated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt it
keenly. They were now a miserable trio, confined within doors by a
series of rain and snow, with nothing to do and no variety to hope for.
Angry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was with Edmund for adhering to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own notions, and acting
on them in defiance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) -LRB-and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been so angry that they had
hardly parted friends at the ball-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not help thinking of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) continually when absent, dwelling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) merit and affection, and
longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) absence
was unnecessarily long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should not have planned such an absence--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
should not have left home for a week, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own departure from
Mansfield was so near. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to blame herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had not spoken so warmly in their last conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had used some strong, some contemptuous expressions in speaking of the
clergy, and that should not have been. It was ill-bred; it was wrong.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wished such words unsaid with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) vexation did not end with the week. All this was bad, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund;
when Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slight
communication with the other family which Sunday produced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) learned
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had actually written home to defer his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) return, having promised
to remain some days longer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend.

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt impatience and regret before--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been sorry for
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, and feared its too strong effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now felt
and feared it all tenfold more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had, moreover, to contend with one
disagreeable emotion entirely new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--jealousy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend Mr.
Owen had sisters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) might find them attractive. But, at any rate, his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>)
staying away at a time when, according to all preceding plans, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
to remove to London, meant something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bear. Had Henry
returned, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) talked of doing, at the end of three or four days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
should now have been leaving Mansfield. It became absolutely necessary
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to get to Fanny and try to learn something more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not
live any longer in such solitary wretchedness; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) way
to the Park, through difficulties of walking which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had deemed
unconquerable a week before, for the chance of hearing a little in
addition, for the sake of at least hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) name.

<p/>The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together,
and unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had Fanny to herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could hope for nothing. But
at last Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately Miss
Crawford thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could--<div class="bookquote">``And
how do _you_ like your cousin Edmund's staying away so long? Being the
only young person at home, I consider _you_ as the greatest sufferer.
You must miss him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>). Does his (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) staying longer surprise you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny hesitatingly. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; I had not particularly
expected it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) will always stay longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) talks of. It is the general
way all young men do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) did not, the only time he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) went to see Mr. Owen before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) finds the house more agreeable _now_. He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) is a very--a very pleasing
young man himself, and I cannot help being rather concerned at not
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) again before I go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the
case. I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) comes there
will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to have seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) once more, I confess. But you must give my compliments to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Yes;
I think it must be compliments. Is not there a something wanted,
Miss Price, in our language--a something between compliments and--and
love--to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together? So
many months' acquaintance! But compliments may be sufficient here.
Was his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) letter a long one? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) give you much account of what he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is
doing? Is it Christmas gaieties that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is staying for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle; but I believe
it was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines. All that I
heard was that his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) friend had pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to stay longer, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
had agreed to do so. A _few_ days longer, or _some_ days longer; I am
not quite sure which.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) father; but I thought it might have been to Lady
Bertram or you. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) father, no wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was concise.
Who could write chat to Sir Thomas? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had written to you, there
would have been more particulars. You would have heard of balls
and parties. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would have sent you a description of everything and
everybody. How many Miss Owens are there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three grown up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they musical?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not at all know. I never heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the first question, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, trying to
appear gay and unconcerned, <div class="bookquote">``which every woman who plays herself is sure
to ask about another. But it is very foolish to ask questions about
any young ladies--about any three sisters just grown up; for one knows,
without being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished and
pleasing, and one very pretty. There is a beauty in every family; it is
a regular thing. Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp; and
all sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better for
not being taught; or something like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of the Miss Owens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know nothing and you care less, as people say. Never did tone
express indifference plainer. Indeed, how can one care for those one has
never seen? Well, when your cousin comes back, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) will find Mansfield
very quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself. I
do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
does not like my going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny felt obliged to speak. <div class="bookquote">``You cannot doubt your being missed by
many,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You will be very much missed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Crawford turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as if wanting to hear or see more,
and then laughingly said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! missed as every noisy evil is missed
when it is taken away; that is, there is a great difference felt. But I
am not fishing; don't compliment me. If I _am_ missed, it will appear.
I may be discovered by those who want to see me. I shall not be in any
doubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss Crawford was
disappointed; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
power from one who she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought must know, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spirits were clouded
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Miss Owens,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), soon afterwards; <div class="bookquote">``suppose you were to have
one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey; how should you like it?
Stranger things have happened. I dare say they are trying for it. And
they are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty establishment
for them. I do not at all wonder or blame them. It is everybody's duty
to do as well for themselves as they can. Sir Thomas Bertram's son is
somebody; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is in their own line. Their father is a clergyman,
and their brother is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen together.
He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is their lawful property; he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) fairly belongs to them. You don't speak,
Fanny; Miss Price, you don't speak. But honestly now, do not you rather
expect it than otherwise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny stoutly, <div class="bookquote">``I do not expect it at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Crawford with alacrity. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder at that. But
I dare say you know exactly--I always imagine you are--perhaps you do
not think him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) likely to marry at all--or not at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I do not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny softly, hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not err either in the
belief or the acknowledgment of it.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) companion looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) keenly; and gathering greater spirit from
the blush soon produced from such a look, only said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is best off as
he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>and turned the subject.



<p/>CHAPTER XXX

<p/>Miss Crawford's uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another
week of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put
to the proof; but as that very evening brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother down from
London again in quite, or more than quite, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) usual cheerfulness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had nothing farther to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) still refusing to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) what
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might
have irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke--suspected only of
concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And the
next day _did_ bring a surprise to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Henry had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should just
go and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was gone above an hour; and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister, who had been waiting for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in the garden, met him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at last most impatiently in
the sweep, and cried out, <div class="bookquote">``My dear Henry, where can you have been
all this time?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had only to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been sitting with Lady
Bertram and Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sitting with them an hour and a half!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mary.

<p/>But this was only the beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arm within his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and walking along
the sweep as if not knowing where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was: <div class="bookquote">``I could not get away sooner;
Fanny looked so lovely! I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is entirely
made up. Will it astonish you? No: you must be aware that I am quite
determined to marry Fanny Price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
consciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) having any such views
had never entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister's imagination; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) looked so truly the
astonishment she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) felt, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was obliged to repeat what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had said,
and more fully and more solemnly. The conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) determination
once admitted, it was not unwelcome. There was even pleasure with the
surprise. Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with the
Bertram family, and to be not displeased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother's marrying a
little beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>was Henry's concluding assurance. <div class="bookquote">``I am fairly caught.
You know with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them.
I have, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
affections; but my own are entirely fixed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucky, lucky girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>cried Mary, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could speak; <div class="bookquote">``what a
match for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)! My dearest Henry, this must be my _first_ feeling; but
my _second_, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your
choice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish
and desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and
devotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an amazing match for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)! Mrs.
Norris often talks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) luck; what will she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) say now? The delight
of all the family, indeed! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) has some _true_ friends in it! How
_they_ will rejoice! But tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever. When
did you begin to think seriously about her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, though
nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked. <div class="bookquote">``How the pleasing
plague had stolen on him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could not say; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had expressed
the same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister eagerly interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear Henry, and this
is what took you to London! This was your business! You chose to consult
the Admiral before you made up your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But this he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stoutly denied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) uncle too well to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) on
any matrimonial scheme. The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it never
pardonable in a young man of independent fortune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When Fanny is known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>continued Henry, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) will doat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as
the Admiral, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) would describe, if indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) has now delicacy
of language enough to embody his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) own ideas. But till it is absolutely
settled--settled beyond all interference, he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) shall know nothing of the
matter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You have not discovered my
business yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it must relate, and am
in no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! That
Mansfield should have done so much for--that _you_ should have found
your fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not have
chosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, and you do not
want for fortune; and as to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) connexions, they are more than good. The
Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world. But
go on, go on. Tell me more. What are your plans? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own
happiness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you waiting for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For--for very little more than opportunity. Mary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! you cannot. Were you even less pleasing--supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not to
love you already -LRB-of which, however, I can have little doubt-RRB---you would
be safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) disposition would secure
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
marry you _without_ love; that is, if there is a girl in the world
capable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); but ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to love you, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will never have the heart to refuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eagerness could rest in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was as happy to tell
as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply
interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as to himself, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had in fact nothing to
relate but his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny's charms.
Fanny's beauty of face and figure, Fanny's graces of manner and goodness
of heart, were the exhaustless theme. The gentleness, modesty, and
sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) character were warmly expatiated on; that sweetness
which makes so essential a part of every woman's worth in the judgment
of man, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sometimes loves where it is not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can never
believe it absent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) temper he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had good reason to depend on and
to praise. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had often seen it tried. Was there one of the family,
excepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually exercised
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) patience and forbearance? Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affections were evidently strong. To
see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother! What could more delightfully prove that the
warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart was equal to its gentleness? What could be more
encouraging to a man who had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love in view? Then, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) understanding
was beyond every suspicion, quick and clear; and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manners were the
mirror of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own modest and elegant mind. Nor was this all. Henry
Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles
in a wife, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was too little accustomed to serious reflection to
know them by their proper name; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) having such a
steadiness and regularity of conduct, such a high notion of honour, and
such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest
dependence on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) faith and integrity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expressed what was inspired by
the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) being well principled and religious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and _that_
is what I want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well might his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister, believing as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) really did that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinion of
Fanny Price was scarcely beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) merits, rejoice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) prospects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The more I think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``the more am I convinced that you
are doing quite right; and though I should never have selected Fanny
Price as the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is
the very one to make you happy. Your wicked project upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) peace turns
out a clever thought indeed. You will both find your good in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature; but I did not know
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) then; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put
it into my head. I will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very happy, Mary; happier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has
ever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else. I will not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
from Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in this
neighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge. I shall let a seven years' lease
of Everingham. I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word. I could
name three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>cried Mary; <div class="bookquote">``settle in Northamptonshire! That is pleasant! Then we
shall be all together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had spoken it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recollected herself, and wished it unsaid;
but there was no need of confusion; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only as the
supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in
the kindest manner to his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) own house, and to claim the best right in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must give us more than half your time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I cannot admit
Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall
both have a right in you. Fanny will be so truly your sister!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
now very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sister
many months longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right; and in London, of course, a house of your own: no longer
with the Admiral. My dearest Henry, the advantage to you of getting away
from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>),
before you have contracted any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) foolish opinions, or learned to
sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life! _You_ are
not sensible of the gain, for your regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has blinded you; but,
in my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you. To have
seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture, would
have broken my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, we do not think quite alike here. The Admiral has his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
faults, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) is a very good man, and has been more than a father to
me. Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much. You must
not prejudice Fanny against him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I must have them love one another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary refrained from saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt, that there could not be two
persons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant:
time would discover it to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not help _this_ reflection
on the Admiral. <div class="bookquote">``Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I
could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which
my poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the
marriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you _loved_
would be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to
love, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a
gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny
Price happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course the
groundwork of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) eloquent answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) this morning, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``attending with
such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aunt's
stupidity, working with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) colour beautifully
heightened as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) leant over the work, then returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seat to
finish a note which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was previously engaged in writing for that
stupid woman's service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness,
so much as if it were a matter of course that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not to have a
moment at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own command, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair arranged as neatly as it always is,
and one little curl falling forward as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wrote, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now and then
shook back, and in the midst of all this, still speaking at intervals to
_me_, or listening, and as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked to listen, to what I said. Had
you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so, Mary, you would not have implied the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
power over my heart ever ceasing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) face,
<div class="bookquote">``how glad I am to see you so much in love! It quite delights me. But
what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see what
sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of sense.
I wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see their
cousin treated as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily
ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They will be
angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) added, after a moment's silence, and in a cooler tone; <div class="bookquote">``Mrs.
Rushworth will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>); that is,
like other bitter pills, it will have two moments' ill flavour, and then
be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) feelings more lasting than other women's, though _I_ was the object
of them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a difference indeed: a daily,
hourly difference, in the behaviour of every being who approaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>);
and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer
of it, that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) due.
Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is dependent, helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or
forgotten. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Edmund never forgets her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Edmund! True, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is, generally speaking, kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and
so is Sir Thomas in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) way; but it is the way of a rich, superior,
long-worded, arbitrary uncle. What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together
do, what do they _do_ for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity in
the world, to what I _shall_ do?''



 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXI

<p/>Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an
earlier hour than common visiting warrants. The two ladies were together
in the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), Lady Bertram was on the
very point of quitting it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was almost at the door, and
not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) still went
on, after a civil reception, a short sentence about being waited for,
and a <div class="bookquote">``Let Sir Thomas know''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to the servant.

<p/>Henry, overjoyed to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) go, bowed and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) off, and without
losing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny, and, taking out some
letters, said, with a most animated look, <div class="bookquote">``I must acknowledge myself
infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity
of seeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have any
idea. Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could hardly
have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the
first knowledge of the news I now bring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) is made. Your brother is a
lieutenant. I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on
your brother's promotion. Here are the letters which announce it, this
moment come to hand. You will, perhaps, like to see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny could not speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did not want her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to speak. To see the
expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes, the change of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) complexion, the progress of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings, their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) took
the letters as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) gave them. The first was from the Admiral to inform
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nephew, in a few words, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) having succeeded in the object he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had
undertaken, the promotion of young Price, and enclosing two more, one
from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend, whom the Admiral had
set to work in the business, the other from that friend to himself,
by which it appeared that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lordship had the very great happiness of
attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles; that Sir Charles was
much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) regard
for Admiral Crawford, and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price's
commission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made out was
spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people.

<p/>While her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hand was trembling under these letters, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eye running from
one to the other, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart swelling with emotion, Crawford thus
continued, with unfeigned eagerness, to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) interest in the
event--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not talk of my own happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``great as it is, for I
think only of yours. Compared with you, who has a right to be happy? I
have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to
have known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however.
The post was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment's
delay. How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject,
I will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly
disappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London! I was
kept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear
to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from
Mansfield. But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the
warmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were
difficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of
another, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and
knowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday,
trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by
such very letters as these. My uncle, who is the very best man in
the world, has exerted himself, as I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would, after seeing your
brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was delighted with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). I would not allow myself yesterday
to say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
praise. I deferred it all till his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) praise should be proved the praise of
a friend, as this day _does_ prove it. _Now_ I may say that even I could
not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be followed
by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most voluntarily
bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has this been all _your_ doing, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``Good heaven! how
very, very kind! Have you really--was it by _your_ desire? I beg your
pardon, but I am bewildered. Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was it? I
am stupefied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible, by beginning at an
earlier stage, and explaining very particularly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had done. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
last journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that
of introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother in Hill Street, and prevailing on the Admiral
to exert whatever interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) might have for getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) on. This had
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had communicated it to no creature: he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had not
breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the issue,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) could not have borne any participation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) feelings, but this had
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) business; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) spoke with such a glow of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) solicitude
had been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding in the
_deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_ _wishes_
_more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have remained
insensible of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) drift, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) been able to attend; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart was
so full and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) senses still so astonished, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could listen but
imperfectly even to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) of William, and saying only when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) paused, <div class="bookquote">``How kind! how very kind! Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are infinitely
obliged to you! Dearest, dearest William!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) jumped up and moved in
haste towards the door, crying out, <div class="bookquote">``I will go to my uncle. My uncle
ought to know it as soon as possible.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But this could not be suffered.
The opportunity was too fair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) feelings too impatient. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) was
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) immediately. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must not go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must allow him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) five minutes
longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat, and was in
the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) farther explanation, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had suspected for what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was detained. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did understand it, however, and found herself
expected to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had created sensations which his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) heart had
never known before, and that everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had done for William was to
be placed to the account of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) excessive and unequalled attachment
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments unable
to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) considered it all as nonsense, as mere trifling and
gallantry, which meant only to deceive for the hour; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not but
feel that it was treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) improperly and unworthily, and in such a
way as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not deserved; but it was like himself, and entirely of a
piece with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen before; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not allow herself to
shew half the displeasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt, because he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been conferring an
obligation, which no want of delicacy on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) part could make a trifle
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). While her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude on
William's behalf, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not be severely resentful of anything that
injured only herself; and after having twice drawn back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and
twice attempted in vain to turn away from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) got up, and said
only, with much agitation, <div class="bookquote">``Don't, Mr. Crawford, pray don't! I beg you
would not. This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me. I
must go away. I cannot bear it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was still talking on, describing
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) affection, soliciting a return, and, finally, in words so plain as
to bear but one meaning even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), offering himself, hand, fortune,
everything, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) acceptance. It was so; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had said it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
astonishment and confusion increased; and though still not knowing
how to suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) serious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could hardly stand. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pressed for an
answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``This is all nonsense. Do not
distress me. I can hear no more of this. Your kindness to William makes
me more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, I
cannot bear, I must not listen to such--No, no, don't think of me. But
you are _not_ thinking of me. I know it is all nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had burst away from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard
speaking to a servant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) way towards the room they were in. It was
no time for farther assurances or entreaty, though to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at
a moment when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) modesty alone seemed, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sanguine and preassured
mind, to stand in the way of the happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sought, was a cruel
necessity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rushed out at an opposite door from the one her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle
was approaching, and was walking up and down the East room in the
utmost confusion of contrary feeling, before Sir Thomas's politeness
or apologies were over, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had reached the beginning of the joyful
intelligence which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) visitor came to communicate.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything; agitated, happy,
miserable, infinitely obliged, absolutely angry. It was all beyond
belief! He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was inexcusable, incomprehensible! But such were his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) habits
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could do nothing without a mixture of evil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had previously
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the happiest of human beings, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had insulted--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew
not what to say, how to class, or how to regard it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) be serious, and yet what could excuse the use of such words and
offers, if they meant but to trifle?

<p/>But William was a lieutenant. _That_ was a fact beyond a doubt, and
without an alloy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would think of it for ever and forget all the
rest. Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so again: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must
have seen how unwelcome it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and in that case, how gratefully
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) friendship to William!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great
staircase, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford's having left
the house; but when convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was eager to go
down and be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, and have all the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) joy
as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own, and all the benefit of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) information or his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
conjectures as to what would now be William's destination. Sir Thomas
was as joyful as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could desire, and very kind and communicative; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had so comfortable a talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) about William as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found, towards the
close, that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that
very day. This was a most unwelcome hearing, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might think
nothing of what had passed, it would be quite distressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again so soon.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tried to get the better of it; tried very hard, as the dinner hour
approached, to feel and appear as usual; but it was quite impossible for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor entered
the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrence
of circumstances to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so many painful sensations on the first day
of hearing of William's promotion.

<p/>Mr. Crawford was not only in the room--he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was soon close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had a note to deliver from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister. Fanny could not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), but
there was no consciousness of past folly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
note immediately, glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) read
it, to feel that the fidgetings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris, who was also to dine
there, screened her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a little from view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Fanny,--for so I may now always call you, to the infinite
relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _Miss_ _Price_ for at
least the last six weeks--I cannot let my brother go without sending you
a few lines of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful consent
and approval. Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear; there can be no
difficulties worth naming. I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my
consent will be something; so you may smile upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with your sweetest
smiles this afternoon, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) back to me even happier than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
goes.--Yours affectionately, M. C.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>These were not expressions to do Fanny any good; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) read
in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss
Crawford's meaning, it was evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meant to compliment her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother's attachment, and even to _appear_ to believe it serious.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not know what to do, or what to think. There was wretchedness in
the idea of its being serious; there was perplexity and agitation every
way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spoke
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) much too often; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was afraid there was a something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
voice and manner in addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) very different from what they were
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) talked to the others. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) comfort in that day's dinner was
quite destroyed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could hardly eat anything; and when Sir Thomas
good-humouredly observed that joy had taken away her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) appetite, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
was ready to sink with shame, from the dread of Mr. Crawford's
interpretation; for though nothing could have tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to turn
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eyes to the right hand, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt that _his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ were
immediately directed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was more silent than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would hardly join even when William
was the subject, for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) commission came all from the right hand too,
and there was pain in the connexion.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began to be in
despair of ever getting away; but at last they were in the drawing-room,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was able to think as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) aunts finished the
subject of William's appointment in their own style.

<p/>Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to
Sir Thomas as with any part of it. <div class="bookquote">``_Now_ William would be able to keep
himself, which would make a vast difference to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uncle, for it was
unknown how much he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had cost his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uncle; and, indeed, it would make some
difference in _her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ presents too. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was very glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had given
William what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did at parting, very glad, indeed, that it had been in
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) power, without material inconvenience, just at that time to give him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
something rather considerable; that is, for _her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_, with _her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ limited
means, for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cabin.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must be at some expense, that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would have many things to
buy, though to be sure his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father and mother would be able to put him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in
the way of getting everything very cheap; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was very glad she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
contributed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mite towards it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) something considerable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram, with
most unsuspicious calmness, <div class="bookquote">``for _I_ gave him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) only 10 pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Norris, reddening. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must have gone
off with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pockets well lined, and at no expense for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) journey to
London either!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas told me 10 pounds would be enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency,
began to take the matter in another point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is amazing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how much young people cost their friends,
what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! They
little think how much it comes to, or what their parents, or their
uncles and aunts, pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here are
my sister Price's children; take them all together, I dare say nobody
would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say nothing
of what _I_ do for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, sister, as you say. But, poor things! they cannot help
it; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas. Fanny,
William must not forget my shawl if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) goes to the East Indies; and I
shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a commission for anything else that is worth having. I
wish he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think I
will have two shawls, Fanny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could not help it, was very
earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at. There
was everything in the world _against_ their being serious but his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) words
and manner. Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against it;
all their habits and ways of thinking, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own demerits. How
could _she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so
many, and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many, infinitely
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) superiors; who seemed so little open to serious impressions, even
where pains had been taken to please him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); who thought so slightly, so
carelessly, so unfeelingly on all such points; who was everything to
everybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? And farther,
how could it be supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) high and worldly
notions of matrimony, would be forwarding anything of a serious nature
in such a quarter? Nothing could be more unnatural in either. Fanny
was ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own doubts. Everything might be possible rather than
serious attachment, or serious approbation of it toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford
joined them. The difficulty was in maintaining the conviction quite so
absolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room; for once or twice a
look seemed forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not know how to class among the
common meaning; in any other man, at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have said that
it meant something very earnest, very pointed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) still tried to
believe it no more than what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might often have expressed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
cousins and fifty other women.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wishing to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) unheard by the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was trying for it the whole evening at intervals, whenever
Sir Thomas was out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) carefully refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) every opportunity.

<p/>At last--it seemed an at last to Fanny's nervousness, though not
remarkably late--he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) began to talk of going away; but the comfort of the
sound was impaired by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the next moment, and saying,
<div class="bookquote">``Have you nothing to send to Mary? No answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) note? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will be
disappointed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) receives nothing from you. Pray write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), if it
be only a line.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, rising in haste, the haste of
embarrassment and of wanting to get away--<div class="bookquote">``I will write directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went accordingly to the table, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in the habit of writing
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, and prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) materials without knowing what in the
world to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had read Miss Crawford's note only once, and how to
reply to anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing.
Quite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had there been time for
scruples and fears as to style she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have felt them in abundance:
but something must be instantly written; and with only one decided
feeling, that of wishing not to appear to think anything really
intended, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and hand--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford, for your kind
congratulations, as far as they relate to my dearest William. The rest
of your note I know means nothing; but I am so unequal to anything of
the sort, that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther
notice. I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
manners; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) understood me as well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would, I dare say, behave
differently. I do not know what I write, but it would be a great favour
of you never to mention the subject again. With thanks for the honour of
your note, I remain, dear Miss Crawford, etc., etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>spirits hand</b></font>)</div><p/>The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence of receiving the note, was
coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot think I mean to hurry you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), in an undervoice,
perceiving the amazing trepidation with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) made up the note, <div class="bookquote">``you
cannot think I have any such object. Do not hurry yourself, I entreat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will be ready in a
moment; I am very much obliged to you; if you will be so good as to give
_that_ to Miss Crawford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The note was held out, and must be taken; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) instantly and with
averted eyes walked towards the fireplace, where sat the others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
nothing to do but to go in good earnest.

<p/>Fanny thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never known a day of greater agitation, both of
pain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die
with the day; for every day would restore the knowledge of William's
advancement, whereas the pain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped, would return no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
no doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) note must appear excessively ill-written, that
the language would disgrace a child, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) distress had allowed no
arrangement; but at least it would assure them both of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being neither
imposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford's attentions.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXII

<p/>Fanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) awoke the next
morning; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) remembered the purport of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) note, and was not less
sanguine as to its effect than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been the night before. If Mr.
Crawford would but go away! That was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) most earnestly desired:
go and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister with him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was to do, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) returned to
Mansfield on purpose to do. And why it was not done already she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
not devise, for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay. Fanny had
hoped, in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) yesterday's visit, to hear the day named;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere
long.

<p/>Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) note would convey,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) accidentally
did, coming up to the house again, and at an hour as early as the day
before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) coming might have nothing to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must avoid
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) if possible; and being then on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) way upstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) resolved
there to remain, during the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) visit, unless actually sent
for; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house, there seemed little
danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) being wanted.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sat some time in a good deal of agitation, listening, trembling, and
fearing to be sent for every moment; but as no footsteps approached the
East room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) grew gradually composed, could sit down, and be able to
employ herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and would go
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) being obliged to know anything of the matter.

<p/>Nearly half an hour had passed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was growing very comfortable,
when suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard; a heavy
step, an unusual step in that part of the house: it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) uncle's; she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
knew it as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) voice; she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had trembled at it as often, and began
to tremble again, at the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) coming up to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), whatever
might be the subject. It was indeed Sir Thomas who opened the door and
asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) were there, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might come in. The terror of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
former occasional visits to that room seemed all renewed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) felt
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) were going to examine her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) again in French and English.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was all attention, however, in placing a chair for him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and trying
to appear honoured; and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) agitation, had quite overlooked the
deficiencies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) apartment, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), stopping short as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) entered,
said, with much surprise, <div class="bookquote">``Why have you no fire to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was snow on the ground, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was sitting in a shawl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not cold, sir: I never sit here long at this time of year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have a fire in general?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How comes this about? Here must be some mistake. I understood that you
had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable.
In your bedchamber I know you _cannot_ have a fire. Here is some great
misapprehension which must be rectified. It is highly unfit for you to
sit, be it only half an hour a day, without a fire. You are not strong.
You are chilly. Your aunt cannot be aware of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
could not forbear, in justice to the aunt she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) loved best, from saying
something in which the words <div class="bookquote">``my aunt Norris''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were distinguishable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) uncle, recollecting himself, and not wanting
to hear more: <div class="bookquote">``I understand. Your aunt Norris has always been an
advocate, and very judiciously, for young people's being brought up
without unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in
everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) is also very hardy herself, which of course will
influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) opinion of the wants of others. And on another
account, too, I can perfectly comprehend. I know what her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sentiments
have always been. The principle was good in itself, but it may have
been, and I believe _has_ _been_, carried too far in your case. I
am aware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaced
distinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you will
ever harbour resentment on that account. You have an understanding
which will prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judging
partially by the event. You will take in the whole of the past, you
will consider times, persons, and probabilities, and you will feel that
_they_ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you
for that mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot. Though
their caution may prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant; and
of this you may be assured, that every advantage of affluence will be
doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been
imposed. I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by failing
at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and attention
that are due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). But enough of this. Sit down, my dear. I must speak
to you for a few minutes, but I will not detain you long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny obeyed, with eyes cast down and colour rising. After a moment's
pause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress a smile, went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor this morning. I
had not been long in my own room, after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford was
shewn in. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) errand you may probably conjecture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny's colour grew deeper and deeper; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, perceiving that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking
up quite impossible, turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own eyes, and without any farther
pause proceeded in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) account of Mr. Crawford's visit.

<p/>Mr. Crawford's business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny,
make decided proposals for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and entreat the sanction of the uncle,
who seemed to stand in the place of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents; and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had done it all
so well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas, feeling,
moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own replies, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own remarks to have been very much
to the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their
conversation; and little aware of what was passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece's mind,
conceived that by such details he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must be gratifying her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) far more than
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) talked, therefore, for several minutes without Fanny's
daring to interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hardly even attained the wish to do it.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind was in too much confusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) position; and,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes fixed intently on one of the windows, was listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
uncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) ceased, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had barely become conscious of it, when, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``And now, Fanny, having performed one part of my commission,
and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and
satisfactory, I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to
accompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot but presume on having
been no unacceptable companion myself, I must submit to your finding
one still better worth listening to. Mr. Crawford, as you have perhaps
foreseen, is yet in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is in my room, and hoping to see you
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this, which
astonished Sir Thomas; but what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) increase of astonishment on
hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) exclaim--<div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Mr. Crawford ought to know--he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must know that: I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) enough
yesterday to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spoke to me on this subject yesterday,
and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me, and
quite out of my power to return his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) good opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not catch your meaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, sitting down again. <div class="bookquote">``Out
of your power to return his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) good opinion? What is all this? I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
spoke to you yesterday, and -LRB-as far as I understand-RRB- received as much
encouragement to proceed as a well-judging young woman could permit
herself to give. I was very much pleased with what I collected to have
been your behaviour on the occasion; it shewed a discretion highly to
be commended. But now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has made his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) overtures so properly, and
honourably--what are your scruples _now_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety of the
moment even to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was wrong; <div class="bookquote">``you are quite
mistaken. How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing? I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) no
encouragement yesterday. On the contrary, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), I cannot recollect
my exact words, but I am sure I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that I would not listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),
that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and that I begged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) never to talk to me in that manner again. I am sure I said as much
as that and more; and I should have said still more, if I had been quite
certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meaning anything seriously; but I did not like to be, I
could not bear to be, imputing more than might be intended. I thought it
might all pass for nothing with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could say no more; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) breath was almost gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, after a few moments' silence,
<div class="bookquote">``that you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Refuse Mr. Crawford! Upon what plea? For what reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I cannot like him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), sir, well enough to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very strange!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, in a voice of calm displeasure.
<div class="bookquote">``There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach. Here
is a young man wishing to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) addresses to you, with everything to
recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): not merely situation in life, fortune, and character,
but with more than common agreeableness, with address and conversation
pleasing to everybody. And he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is not an acquaintance of to-day; you have
now known him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) some time. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sister, moreover, is your intimate friend,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has been doing _that_ for your brother, which I should suppose
would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you, had there been
no other. It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William
on. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has done it already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down with fresh shame;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did feel almost ashamed of herself, after such a picture as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
uncle had drawn, for not liking Mr. Crawford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have been aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>continued Sir Thomas presently, <div class="bookquote">``you must
have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford's manners
to you. This cannot have taken you by surprise. You must have observed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attentions; and though you always received them very properly -LRB-I
have no accusation to make on that head-RRB-, I never perceived them to be
unpleasant to you. I am half inclined to think, Fanny, that you do not
quite know your own feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, sir! indeed I do. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attentions were always--what I did not
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with deeper surprise. <div class="bookquote">``This is beyond me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This requires explanation. Young as you are, and having seen
scarcely any one, it is hardly possible that your affections--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) paused and eyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fixedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lips formed into a _no_,
though the sound was inarticulate, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face was like scarlet. That,
however, in so modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence;
and chusing at least to appear satisfied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) quickly added, <div class="bookquote">``No, no, I
know _that_ is quite out of the question; quite impossible. Well, there
is nothing more to be said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And for a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did say nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was deep in thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
niece was deep in thought likewise, trying to harden and prepare herself
against farther questioning. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) would rather die than own the truth;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) hoped, by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyond
betraying it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford's _choice_ seemed to
justify''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me. I am an
advocate for early marriages, where there are means in proportion, and
would have every young man, with a sufficient income, settle as soon
after four-and-twenty as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can. This is so much my opinion, that I am
sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr.
Bertram, is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge,
matrimony makes no part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) plans or thoughts. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) were more
likely to fix.''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>Here was a glance at Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``Edmund, I consider, from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
could love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not. Am I right? Do
you agree with me, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>It was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was easy on the
score of the cousins. But the removal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) alarm did his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece
no service: as her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) unaccountableness was confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) displeasure
increased; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown, which
Fanny could picture to herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dared not lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said, <div class="bookquote">``Have you any
reason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford's temper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) longed to add, <div class="bookquote">``But of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) principles I have'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart sunk
under the appalling prospect of discussion, explanation, and probably
non-conviction. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ill opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was founded chiefly on
observations, which, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins' sake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could scarcely dare
mention to their father. Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were so
closely implicated in Mr. Crawford's misconduct, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could not give
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) character, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) believed it, without betraying them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had
hoped that, to a man like her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) uncle, so discerning, so honourable, so
good, the simple acknowledgment of settled _dislike_ on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) side would
have been sufficient. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) infinite grief she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) found it was not.

<p/>Sir Thomas came towards the table where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sat in trembling
wretchedness, and with a good deal of cold sternness, said, <div class="bookquote">``It is of no
use, I perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this most
mortifying conference. Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting. I
will, therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of
your conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed,
and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had
supposed. For I _had_, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have shewn,
formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to
England. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper,
self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit which
prevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which in young
women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence. But you
have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you can and
will decide for yourself, without any consideration or deference for
those who have surely some right to guide you, without even asking their
advice. You have shewn yourself very, very different from anything that
I had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of your family, of your
parents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to have had a moment's
share in your thoughts on this occasion. How _they_ might be benefited,
how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment for you, is nothing to
_you_. You think only of yourself, and because you do not feel for Mr.
Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for
happiness, you resolve to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at once, without wishing even for
a little time to consider of it, a little more time for cool
consideration, and for really examining your own inclinations; and are,
in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from you such an opportunity of
being settled in life, eligibly, honourably, nobly settled, as will,
probably, never occur to you again. Here is a young man of sense, of
character, of temper, of manners, and of fortune, exceedingly attached
to you, and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested
way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you may live eighteen years longer
in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford's
estate, or a tenth part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) merits. Gladly would I have bestowed
either of my own daughters on him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Maria is nobly married; but had
Mr. Crawford sought Julia's hand, I should have given it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with
superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria's to Mr.
Rushworth.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After half a moment's pause: <div class="bookquote">``And I should have been very
much surprised had either of my daughters, on receiving a proposal
of marriage at any time which might carry with it only _half_ the
eligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily, and without paying
my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation, put a
decided negative on it. I should have been much surprised and much hurt
by such a proceeding. I should have thought it a gross violation of duty
and respect. _You_ are not to be judged by the same rule. You do not
owe me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if your heart can acquit you of
_ingratitude_--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) ceased. Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that, angry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not press that article farther. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart was almost broke
by such a picture of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>); by such accusations,
so heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation! Self-willed,
obstinate, selfish, and ungrateful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) all this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
deceived his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) expectations; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) good opinion. What was to
become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) inarticulately, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tears, <div class="bookquote">``I am
very sorry indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably have reason to
be long sorry for this day's transactions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it were possible for me to do otherwise''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), with another
strong effort; <div class="bookquote">``but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make
him (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) happy, and that I should be miserable myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Another burst of tears; but in spite of that burst, and in spite of that
great black word _miserable_, which served to introduce it, Sir Thomas
began to think a little relenting, a little change of inclination, might
have something to do with it; and to augur favourably from the personal
entreaty of the young man himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be very timid, and
exceedingly nervous; and thought it not improbable that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind
might be in such a state as a little time, a little pressing, a little
patience, and a little impatience, a judicious mixture of all on the
lover's side, might work their usual effect on. If the gentleman would
but persevere, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had but love enough to persevere, Sir Thomas began
to have hopes; and these reflections having passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mind and
cheered it, <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less
anger, <div class="bookquote">``well, child, dry up your tears. There is no use in these tears;
they can do no good. You must now come downstairs with me. Mr. Crawford
has been kept waiting too long already. You must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) your own
answer: we cannot expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to be satisfied with less; and you only
can explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments,
which, unfortunately for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) certainly has imbibed. I am totally
unequal to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going down
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it better
to indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small
depression in consequence; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, and saw the
state of feature and complexion which her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) crying had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
into, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought there might be as much lost as gained by an immediate
interview. With a few words, therefore, of no particular meaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
walked off by himself, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) poor niece to sit and cry over what
had passed, with very wretched feelings.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) mind was all disorder. The past, present, future, everything was
terrible. But her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle's anger gave her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) the severest pain of all.
Selfish and ungrateful! to have appeared so to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was miserable
for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had no one to take her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) part, to counsel, or speak for her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) only friend was absent. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might have softened his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father; but all,
perhaps all, would think her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) selfish and ungrateful. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) might have to
endure the reproach again and again; she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) might hear it, or see it, or
know it to exist for ever in every connexion about her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) could not
but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford; yet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) really loved
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and were unhappy too! It was all wretchedness together.

<p/>In about a quarter of an hour her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle returned; she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was almost
ready to faint at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) spoke calmly, however, without
austerity, without reproach, and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) revived a little. There was
comfort, too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) words, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) manner, for he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) began with,
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Crawford is gone: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has just left me. I need not repeat what has
passed. I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling, by an
account of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has felt. Suffice it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has behaved in the
most gentlemanlike and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most
favourable opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) understanding, heart, and temper. Upon my
representation of what you were suffering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) immediately, and with the
greatest delicacy, ceased to urge to see you for the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again. <div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>continued
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, <div class="bookquote">``it cannot be supposed but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should request to speak
with you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too natural,
a claim too just to be denied. But there is no time fixed; perhaps
to-morrow, or whenever your spirits are composed enough. For the present
you have only to tranquillise yourself. Check these tears; they do but
exhaust you. If, as I am willing to suppose, you wish to shew me any
observance, you will not give way to these emotions, but endeavour to
reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind. I advise you to go out:
the air will do you good; go out for an hour on the gravel; you will
have the shrubbery to yourself, and will be the better for air and
exercise. And, Fanny''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning back again for a moment-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I shall make
no mention below of what has passed; I shall not even tell your aunt
Bertram. There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment; say
nothing about it yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was an act of
kindness which Fanny felt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart. To be spared from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
Norris's interminable reproaches! he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in a glow of gratitude.
Anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches. Even to see Mr.
Crawford would be less overpowering.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walked out directly, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle recommended, and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
advice throughout, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could; did check her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tears; did
earnestly try to compose her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits and strengthen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished
to prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did desire his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) comfort, and sought to regain
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) favour; and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) another strong motive for exertion, in
keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunts. Not to excite
suspicion by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) look or manner was now an object worth attaining; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt equal to almost anything that might save her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
Norris.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walk and going
into the East room again, the first thing which caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eye was a
fire lighted and burning. A fire! it seemed too much; just at that time
to be giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of such a
trifle again; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) soon found, from the voluntary information of the
housemaid, who came in to attend it, that so it was to be every day. Sir
Thomas had given orders for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in
soliloquy. <div class="bookquote">``Heaven defend me from being ungrateful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw nothing more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, nor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris, till they met
at dinner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) uncle's behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was then as nearly as possible
what it had been before; she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) did not mean there should be
any change, and that it was only her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own conscience that could fancy
any; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) aunt was soon quarrelling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>); and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) found how
much and how unpleasantly her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) having only walked out without her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) aunt's
knowledge could be dwelt on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) felt all the reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had to bless
the kindness which saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) from the same spirit of reproach, exerted
on a more momentous subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had known you were going out, I should have got you just to go
as far as my house with some orders for Nanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``which I have
since, to my very great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carry
myself. I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved me the
trouble, if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were
going out. It would have made no difference to you, I suppose, whether
you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Sir
Thomas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Norris, with a moment's check, <div class="bookquote">``that was very kind of
you, Sir Thomas; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house.
Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with the
advantage of being of some use, and obliging her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt: it is all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
fault. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would but have let us know she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was going out but there is
a something about Fanny, I have often observed it before--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) likes to
go her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own way to work; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not like to be dictated to; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) takes
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own independent walk whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) can; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) certainly has a little
spirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), which I
would advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to get the better of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>As a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be
more unjust, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had been so lately expressing the same sentiments
himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) tried to turn the conversation: tried repeatedly
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to
perceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought
well of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, or how very far he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was from wishing to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own
children's merits set off by the depreciation of hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was talking
_at_ Fanny, and resenting this private walk half through the dinner.

<p/>It was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with more
composure to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
have hoped for after so stormy a morning; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) trusted, in the first
place, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had done right: that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) judgment had not misled her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
For the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) intentions she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could answer; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was willing
to hope, secondly, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle's displeasure was abating, and would
abate farther as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) considered the matter with more impartiality, and
felt, as a good man must feel, how wretched, and how unpardonable, how
hopeless, and how wicked it was to marry without affection.

<p/>When the meeting with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was threatened for the morrow was past,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally
concluded, and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield, that everything
would soon be as if no such subject had existed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not, could
not believe, that Mr. Crawford's affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could distress him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
long; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind was not of that sort. London would soon bring its cure.
In London he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would soon learn to wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) infatuation, and be
thankful for the right reason in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) which had saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) from its evil
consequences.

<p/>While Fanny's mind was engaged in these sort of hopes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle was,
soon after tea, called out of the room; an occurrence too common to
strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten
minutes afterwards, and advancing decidedly towards herself, said,
<div class="bookquote">``Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you, ma’am, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own room.''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>Then it
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) what might be going on; a suspicion rushed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind
which drove the colour from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cheeks; but instantly rising, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
preparing to obey, when Mrs. Norris called out, <div class="bookquote">``Stay, stay, Fanny! what
are you about? where are you going? don't be in such a hurry. Depend
upon it, it is not you who are wanted; depend upon it, it is me''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>-LRB-looking at the butler-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``but you are so very eager to put yourself
forward. What should Sir Thomas want you for? It is me, Baddeley, you
mean; I am coming this moment. You mean me, Baddeley, I am sure; Sir
Thomas wants me, not Miss Price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div><p/>But Baddeley was stout. <div class="bookquote">``No, ma’am, it is Miss Price; I am certain of
its being Miss Price.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And there was a half-smile with the words, which
meant, <div class="bookquote">``I do not think you would answer the purpose at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose herself to work
again; and Fanny, walking off in agitating consciousness, found herself,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) anticipated, in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII

<p/>The conference was neither so short nor so conclusive as the lady had
designed. The gentleman was not so easily satisfied. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had all the
disposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had vanity,
which strongly inclined him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in the first place to think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might not know it herself; and which, secondly, when
constrained at last to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own present feelings,
convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should be able in time to make those feelings what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wished.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which, operating
on an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than delicacy, made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, and
determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not despair: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not desist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had every well-grounded
reason for solid attachment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to have all the worth that
could justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
conduct at this very time, by speaking the disinterestedness and
delicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) character -LRB-qualities which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) believed most rare
indeed-RRB-, was of a sort to heighten all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wishes, and confirm all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
resolutions. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) knew not that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had a pre-engaged heart to attack.
Of _that_ he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had no suspicion. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rather as one who
had never thought on the subject enough to be in danger; who had been
guarded by youth, a youth of mind as lovely as of person; whose modesty
had prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from understanding his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) attentions, and who was still
overpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected, and the
novelty of a situation which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fancy had never taken into account.

<p/>Must it not follow of course, that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was understood, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should
succeed? He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) believed it fully. Love such as his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), in a man like himself,
must with perseverance secure a return, and at no great distance; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had so much delight in the idea of obliging her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to love him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in a very
short time, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) not loving him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) now was scarcely regretted. A little
difficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) rather
derived spirits from it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been apt to gain hearts too easily. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
situation was new and animating.

<p/>To Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life to
find any charm in it, all this was unintelligible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did
mean to persevere; but how he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could, after such language from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
felt herself obliged to use, was not to be understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never should love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); that such a change was quite impossible; that the subject was most
painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) never to mention it again, to
allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at once, and let it be considered as concluded
for ever. And when farther pressed, had added, that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) opinion their
dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affection
incompatible; and that they were unfitted for each other by nature,
education, and habit. All this she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had said, and with the earnestness
of sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) immediately denied there
being anything uncongenial in their characters, or anything unfriendly
in their situations; and positively declared, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would still love,
and still hope!

<p/>Fanny knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own meaning, but was no judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own manner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
manner was incurably gentle; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not aware how much it concealed
the sternness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) purpose. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) diffidence, gratitude, and softness
made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of
self-denial; seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to herself
as to him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>). Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as the
clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had been
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) abhorrence, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hated to see or to speak to, in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of being
agreeable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had barely acknowledged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was now the Mr. Crawford who
was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love; whose feelings
were apparently become all that was honourable and upright, whose views
of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment; who was
pouring out his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) merits, describing and describing again his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
affection, proving as far as words could prove it, and in the language,
tone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
gentleness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) goodness; and to complete the whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now the
Mr. Crawford who had procured William's promotion!

<p/>Here was a change, and here were claims which could not but operate!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have disdained him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) in all the dignity of angry virtue, in
the grounds of Sotherton, or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now with rights that demanded different treatment.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must be courteous, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must be compassionate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have
a sensation of being honoured, and whether thinking of herself or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have a strong feeling of gratitude. The effect of the
whole was a manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) refusal so expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper of
vanity and hope like Crawford's, the truth, or at least the strength
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) indifference, might well be questionable; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not so
irrational as Fanny considered him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), in the professions of persevering,
assiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed the interview.

<p/>It was with reluctance that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to go; but there was no look
of despair in parting to belie his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) words, or give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hopes of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) being
less unreasonable than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) professed himself.

<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was angry. Some resentment did arise at a perseverance so
selfish and ungenerous. Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for
others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Here was again
a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had so reprobated before.
How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity where his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
own pleasure was concerned; and alas! how always known no principle to
supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in! Had her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own affections
been as free as perhaps they ought to have been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) never could have
engaged them.

<p/>So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat musing
over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wondering
at the past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in a
nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) but the persuasion of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, and
the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it.

<p/>Sir Thomas was obliged, or obliged himself, to wait till the morrow for
a knowledge of what had passed between the young people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) then saw
Mr. Crawford, and received his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) account. The first feeling was
disappointment: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had hoped better things; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had thought that an
hour's entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so
little change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny; but there was speedy
comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover;
and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal, Sir Thomas
was soon able to depend on it himself.

<p/>Nothing was omitted, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) side, of civility, compliment, or kindness,
that might assist the plan. Mr. Crawford's steadiness was honoured, and
Fanny was praised, and the connexion was still the most desirable in the
world. At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
only to consult his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
visits, at present or in future. In all his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) niece's family and friends,
there could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the influence
of all who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) must incline one way.

<p/>Everything was said that could encourage, every encouragement received
with grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted the best of friends.

<p/>Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and
hopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, and to shew no open interference. Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) disposition
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) believed kindness might be the best way of working. Entreaty should
be from one quarter only. The forbearance of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) family on a point,
respecting which she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) could be in no doubt of their wishes, might be
their surest means of forwarding it. Accordingly, on this principle, Sir
Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), with a mild gravity,
intended to be overcoming, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr. Crawford again,
and learn from him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) exactly how matters stand between you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is a most
extraordinary young man, and whatever be the event, you must feel that
you have created an attachment of no common character; though, young
as you are, and little acquainted with the transient, varying, unsteady
nature of love, as it generally exists, you cannot be struck as I
am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against
discouragement. With him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) it is entirely a matter of feeling: he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) claims
no merit in it; perhaps is entitled to none. Yet, having chosen so
well, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) constancy has a respectable stamp. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) choice been less
unexceptionable, I should have condemned his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) persevering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should
continue to know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I
feel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I
have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) so, that it never will be in my power--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>interrupted Sir Thomas, <div class="bookquote">``there is no occasion for this. Your
feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be
to you. There is nothing more to be said or done. From this hour the
subject is never to be revived between us. You will have nothing to
fear, or to be agitated about. You cannot suppose me capable of trying
to persuade you to marry against your inclinations. Your happiness and
advantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is required of you
but to bear with Mr. Crawford's endeavours to convince you that they may
not be incompatible with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) proceeds at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own risk. You are on
safe ground. I have engaged for your seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) calls, as
you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred. You will see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with the rest of us, in the same manner, and, as much as you
can, dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) leaves
Northamptonshire so soon, that even this slight sacrifice cannot be
often demanded. The future must be very uncertain. And now, my dear
Fanny, this subject is closed between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much
satisfaction. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle's kind expressions, however, and forbearing
manner, were sensibly felt; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) considered how much of the
truth was unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no right to wonder at
the line of conduct he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) pursued. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), who had married a daughter to Mr.
Rushworth: romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must do her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) duty, and trust that time might make her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) duty easier
than it now was.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford's attachment
would hold out for ever; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not but imagine that steady,
unceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time.
How much time she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might, in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own fancy, allot for its dominion, is
another concern. It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady's
exact estimate of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own perfections.

<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once more
obliged to mention the subject to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) briefly for
its being imparted to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) aunts; a measure which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would still have
avoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally
opposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had no idea of concealment. It was all known at the Parsonage, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) loved to talk over the future with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sisters, and it would be
rather gratifying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to have enlightened witnesses of the progress
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) success. When Sir Thomas understood this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) felt the necessity
of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business
without delay; though, on Fanny's account, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) almost dreaded the
effect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
deprecated her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mistaken but well-meaning zeal. Sir Thomas, indeed, was,
by this time, not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those
well-meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable
things.

<p/>Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) pressed for the strictest
forbearance and silence towards their niece; she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) not only promised, but
did observe it. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) only looked her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) increased ill-will. Angry she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was:
bitterly angry; but she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was more angry with Fanny for having received
such an offer than for refusing it. It was an injury and affront to
Julia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford's choice; and, independently
of that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) disliked Fanny, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
would have grudged such an elevation to one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been always
trying to depress.

<p/>Sir Thomas gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) more credit for discretion on the occasion than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
deserved; and Fanny could have blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) displeasure, and not to hear it.

<p/>Lady Bertram took it differently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had been a beauty, and a
prosperous beauty, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) life; and beauty and wealth were all that
excited her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) respect. To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of
fortune, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), therefore, very much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) opinion. By convincing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been doubting about
before, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be advantageously married, it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feel a
sort of credit in calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), as soon as they were alone together afterwards,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) really had known something like impatience to be alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke, had extraordinary animation; <div class="bookquote">``Well,
Fanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning. I must just
speak of it _once_, I told Sir Thomas I must _once_, and then I
shall have done. I give you joy, my dear niece.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
complacently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Humph, we certainly are a handsome family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say; when, hoping to assail
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) vulnerable side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) presently answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear aunt, _you_ cannot wish me to do differently from what I have
done, I am sure. _You_ cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me,
should not you? Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, I should not think of missing you, when such an offer as
this comes in your way. I could do very well without you, if you were
married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford. And you must be
aware, Fanny, that it is every young woman's duty to accept such a very
unexceptionable offer as this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>This was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece of advice,
which Fanny had ever received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt in the course of eight years
and a half. It silenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt how unprofitable contention would
be. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's feelings were against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), nothing could be hoped from
attacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) understanding. Lady Bertram was quite talkative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you what, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) fell in love with
you at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening. You did
look remarkably well. Everybody said so. Sir Thomas said so. And you
know you had Chapman to help you to dress. I am very glad I sent
Chapman to you. I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done
that evening.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) soon
afterwards added, <div class="bookquote">``And will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than I
did for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXIV

<p/>Edmund had great things to hear on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) return. Many surprises were
awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). The first that occurred was not least in interest: the
appearance of Henry Crawford and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister walking together through the
village as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) rode into it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had concluded--he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had meant them to be
far distant. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely
to avoid Miss Crawford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was returning to Mansfield with spirits ready
to feed on melancholy remembrances, and tender associations, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
own fair self was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother's arm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) found
himself receiving a welcome, unquestionably friendly, from the woman
whom, two moments before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been thinking of as seventy miles off,
and as farther, much farther, from him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) in inclination than any distance
could express.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reception of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was of a sort which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not have hoped
for, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) expected to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Coming as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did from such a purport
fulfilled as had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would have expected anything rather
than a look of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning.
It was enough to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart in a glow, and to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) home in the
properest state for feeling the full value of the other joyful surprises
at hand.

<p/>William's promotion, with all its particulars, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was soon master of;
and with such a secret provision of comfort within his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) own breast to
help the joy, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and
unvarying cheerfulness all dinner-time.

<p/>After dinner, when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father were alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had Fanny's history;
and then all the great events of the last fortnight, and the present
situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>Fanny suspected what was going on. They sat so much longer than usual in
the dining-parlour, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was sure they must be talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and
when tea at last brought them away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was to be seen by Edmund
again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt dreadfully guilty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought that,
but for the occupation and the scene which the tea-things afforded, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
must have betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) emotion in some unpardonable excess.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was not intending, however, by such action, to be conveying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
that unqualified approbation and encouragement which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hopes drew
from it. It was designed only to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) participation in all that
interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been hearing what quickened
every feeling of affection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was, in fact, entirely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father's
side of the question. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) surprise was not so great as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father's at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) refusing Crawford, because, so far from supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to consider
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) with anything like a preference, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had always believed it to
be rather the reverse, and could imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be taken perfectly
unprepared, but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more
desirable than he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did. It had every recommendation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>); and while
honouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had done under the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) present
indifference, honouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas
could quite echo, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine in
believing, that it would be a match at last, and that, united by mutual
affection, it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly
fitted to make them blessed in each other, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was now beginning
seriously to consider them. Crawford had been too precipitate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had
not given her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) time to attach herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had begun at the wrong end.
With such powers as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), however, and such a disposition as hers, Edmund
trusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion. Meanwhile,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw enough of Fanny's embarrassment to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) scrupulously guard
against exciting it a second time, by any word, or look, or movement.

<p/>Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund's return, Sir
Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to stay dinner; it was
really a necessary compliment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) staid of course, and Edmund had then
ample opportunity for observing how he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sped with Fanny, and what degree
of immediate encouragement for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) might be extracted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) manners;
and it was so little, so very, very little--every chance, every
possibility of it, resting upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) embarrassment only; if there was
not hope in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) confusion, there was hope in nothing else--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was
almost ready to wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend's perseverance. Fanny was worth it
all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion of
mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could have gone on himself with any woman
breathing, without something more to warm his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) courage than his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) eyes
could discern in hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was very willing to hope that Crawford saw
clearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could come to from all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) observed to pass before, and at,
and after dinner.

<p/>In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought more
promising. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) and Crawford walked into the drawing-room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother
and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there
were nothing else to care for. Edmund could not help noticing their
apparently deep tranquillity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not been so silent all the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Fanny
has been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you
coming.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air
of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) often
reads to me out of those books; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in the middle of a very
fine speech of that man's--what's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name, Fanny?--when we heard your
footsteps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Crawford took the volume. <div class="bookquote">``Let me have the pleasure of finishing that
speech to your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shall find it immediately.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And by
carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) did find it,
or within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram, who
assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>), as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had got the very speech. Not a look or an offer of help had Fanny
given; not a syllable for or against. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attention was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But taste
was too strong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not abstract her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind five minutes: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was forced to listen; his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) reading was capital, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pleasure in good
reading extreme. To _good_ reading, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been long used:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle read well, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins all, Edmund very well, but in Mr.
Crawford's reading there was a variety of excellence beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
ever met with. The King, the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey, Cromwell, all
were given in turn; for with the happiest knack, the happiest power of
jumping and guessing, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) could always alight at will on the best scene,
or the best speeches of each; and whether it were dignity, or pride, or
tenderness, or remorse, or whatever were to be expressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) could do
it with equal beauty. It was truly dramatic. His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) acting had first taught
Fanny what pleasure a play might give, and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) reading brought all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
acting before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) again; nay, perhaps with greater enjoyment, for it
came unexpectedly, and with no such drawback as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been used to
suffer in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) on the stage with Miss Bertram.

<p/>Edmund watched the progress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) attention, and was amused and
gratified by seeing how she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) gradually slackened in the needlework, which
at the beginning seemed to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) totally: how it fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) hand
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes which had
appeared so studiously to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) throughout the day were turned and
fixed on Crawford--fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) for minutes, fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), in short,
till the attraction drew Crawford's upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and the book was closed,
and the charm was broken. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was shrinking again into herself,
and blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been enough to give
Edmund encouragement for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) cordially thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
hoped to be expressing Fanny's secret feelings too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That play must be a favourite with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you read as if you
knew it well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a favourite, I believe, from this hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Crawford;
<div class="bookquote">``but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before
since I was fifteen. I once saw Henry the Eighth acted, or I have heard
of it from somebody who did, I am not certain which. But Shakespeare
one gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part of an
Englishman's constitution. His (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) thoughts and beauties are so spread
abroad that one touches them everywhere; one is intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) by
instinct. No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
plays without falling into the flow of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meaning immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund,
<div class="bookquote">``from one's earliest years. His (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) celebrated passages are quoted
by everybody; they are in half the books we open, and we all talk
Shakespeare, use his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) similes, and describe with his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) descriptions; but
this is totally distinct from giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) sense as you gave it. To know
him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) in bits and scraps is common enough; to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) pretty thoroughly
is, perhaps, not uncommon; but to read him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) well aloud is no everyday
talent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, you do me honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>was Crawford's answer, with a bow of mock
gravity.

<p/>Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word of accordant
praise could be extorted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); yet both feeling that it could not
be. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) praise had been given in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attention; _that_ must content
them.

<p/>Lady Bertram's admiration was expressed, and strongly too. <div class="bookquote">``It was
really like being at a play,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I wish Sir Thomas had been
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Crawford was excessively pleased. If Lady Bertram, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
incompetency and languor, could feel this, the inference of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
niece, alive and enlightened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was, must feel, was elevating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
ladyship soon afterwards; <div class="bookquote">``and I will tell you what, I think you will
have a theatre, some time or other, at your house in Norfolk. I mean
when you are settled there. I do indeed. I think you will fit up a
theatre at your house in Norfolk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you, ma’am?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), with quickness. <div class="bookquote">``No, no, that will never be.
Your ladyship is quite mistaken. No theatre at Everingham! Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked at Fanny with an expressive smile, which evidently meant,
<div class="bookquote">``That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined _not_ to see it, as to
make it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of
the protestation; and such a quick consciousness of compliment, such a
ready comprehension of a hint, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought, was rather favourable than
not.

<p/>The subject of reading aloud was farther discussed. The two young men
were the only talkers, but they, standing by the fire, talked over the
too common neglect of the qualification, the total inattention to it,
in the ordinary school-system for boys, the consequently natural, yet in
some instances almost unnatural, degree of ignorance and uncouthness
of men, of sensible and well-informed men, when suddenly called to the
necessity of reading aloud, which had fallen within their notice, giving
instances of blunders, and failures with their secondary causes, the
want of management of the voice, of proper modulation and emphasis, of
foresight and judgment, all proceeding from the first cause: want of
early attention and habit; and Fanny was listening again with great
entertainment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even in my profession,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``how little the
art of reading has been studied! how little a clear manner, and good
delivery, have been attended to! I speak rather of the past, however,
than the present. There is now a spirit of improvement abroad; but among
those who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago, the larger
number, to judge by their performance, must have thought reading was
reading, and preaching was preaching. It is different now. The subject
is more justly considered. It is felt that distinctness and energy may
have weight in recommending the most solid truths; and besides, there is
more general observation and taste, a more critical knowledge diffused
than formerly; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who
know a little of the matter, and who can judge and criticise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund had already gone through the service once since his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) ordination;
and upon this being understood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had a variety of questions from
Crawford as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) feelings and success; questions, which being made,
though with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without
any touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew to
be most offensive to Fanny, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had true pleasure in satisfying; and
when Crawford proceeded to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) opinion and give his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own as to the
properest manner in which particular passages in the service should be
delivered, shewing it to be a subject on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had thought before,
and thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and more pleased. This
would be the way to Fanny's heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not to be won by all that
gallantry and wit and good-nature together could do; or, at least,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not be won by them nearly so soon, without the assistance of
sentiment and feeling, and seriousness on serious subjects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our liturgy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>observed Crawford, <div class="bookquote">``has beauties, which not even a
careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; but it has also
redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt.
For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I
ought to be''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>-LRB-here was a glance at Fanny-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``that nineteen times out of
twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to
have it to read myself. Did you speak?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>stepping eagerly to Fanny, and
addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in a softened voice; and upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saying <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied you
might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not _allow_
my thoughts to wander. Are not you going to tell me so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to--even supposing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stopt, felt herself getting into a puzzle, and could not be
prevailed on to add another word, not by dint of several minutes of
supplication and waiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) then returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) former station, and
went on as if there had been no such tender interruption.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than prayers well read.
A sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing. It is more difficult
to speak well than to compose well; that is, the rules and trick of
composition are oftener an object of study. A thoroughly good sermon,
thoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification. I can never hear
such a one without the greatest admiration and respect, and more than
half a mind to take orders and preach myself. There is something in the
eloquence of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitled
to the highest praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and affect
such an heterogeneous mass of hearers, on subjects limited, and long
worn threadbare in all common hands; who can say anything new or
striking, anything that rouses the attention without offending the
taste, or wearing out the feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) hearers, is a man whom one
could not, in his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) public capacity, honour enough. I should like to be
such a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should indeed. I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my
life without a sort of envy. But then, I must have a London audience.
I could not preach but to the educated; to those who were capable of
estimating my composition. And I do not know that I should be fond of
preaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring,
after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but
not for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head,
and Crawford was instantly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) side again, entreating to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
meaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) drawing in a chair, and sitting
down close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), that it was to be a very thorough attack, that looks
and undertones were to be well tried, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sank as quietly as possible
into a corner, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) back, and took up a newspaper, very sincerely
wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away
that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ardent lover; and as
earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in
murmurs of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own, over the various advertisements of <div class="bookquote">``A most desirable
Estate in South Wales'' (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>; <div class="bookquote">``To Parents and Guardians'' (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>; and a <div class="bookquote">``Capital
season'd Hunter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund's
arrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) modest,
gentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looks and
inquiries; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), unrepulsable, was persisting in both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did that shake of the head mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What was it meant to
express? Disapprobation, I fear. But of what? What had I been saying
to displease you? Did you think me speaking improperly, lightly,
irreverently on the subject? Only tell me if I was. Only tell me if
I was wrong. I want to be set right. Nay, nay, I entreat you; for one
moment put down your work. What did that shake of the head mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In vain was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Pray, sir, don't; pray, Mr. Crawford,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>repeated twice
over; and in vain did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) try to move away. In the same low, eager
voice, and the same close neighbourhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) went on, reurging the same
questions as before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) grew more agitated and displeased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you, sir? You quite astonish me; I wonder how you can--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I astonish you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you wonder? Is there anything in
my present entreaty that you do not understand? I will explain to you
instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner, all that gives me
an interest in what you look and do, and excites my present curiosity. I
will not leave you to wonder long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not help half a smile, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said
nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to
engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy. Yes, that
was the word. Constancy: I am not afraid of the word. I would spell it,
read it, write it with anybody. I see nothing alarming in the word. Did
you think I ought?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, wearied at last into speaking--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps,
sir, I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as
you seemed to do at that moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Crawford, delighted to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to speak at any rate, was determined
to keep it up; and poor Fanny, who had hoped to silence him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) by such an
extremity of reproof, found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was only
a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had always something to entreat the explanation of. The opportunity
was too fair. None such had occurred since his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle's
room, none such might occur again before his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) leaving Mansfield. Lady
Bertram's being just on the other side of the table was a trifle,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) might always be considered as only half-awake, and Edmund's
advertisements were still of the first utility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Crawford, after a course of rapid questions and reluctant
answers; <div class="bookquote">``I am happier than I was, because I now understand more clearly
your opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed by the whim of
the moment, easily tempted, easily put aside. With such an opinion, no
wonder that. But we shall see. It is not by protestations that I shall
endeavour to convince you I am wronged; it is not by telling you that my
affections are steady. My conduct shall speak for me; absence, distance,
time shall speak for me. _They_ shall prove that, as far as you can be
deserved by anybody, I do deserve you. You are infinitely my superior
in merit; all _that_ I know. You have qualities which I had not before
supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature. You have some
touches of the angel in you beyond what--not merely beyond what one
sees, because one never sees anything like it--but beyond what one
fancies might be. But still I am not frightened. It is not by equality
of merit that you can be won. That is out of the question. It is he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
who sees and worships your merit the strongest, who loves you most
devotedly, that has the best right to a return. There I build my
confidence. By that right I do and will deserve you; and when once
convinced that my attachment is what I declare it, I know you too well
not to entertain the warmest hopes. Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>-LRB-seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) draw back displeased-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``forgive me. Perhaps I have as yet
no right; but by what other name can I call you? Do you suppose you are
ever present to my imagination under any other? No, it is `Fanny' that
I think of all day, and dream of all night. You have given the name such
reality of sweetness, that nothing else can now be descriptive of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny could hardly have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat any longer, or have refrained from
at least trying to get away in spite of all the too public opposition
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) foresaw to it, had it not been for the sound of approaching relief,
the very sound which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been long watching for, and long thinking
strangely delayed.

<p/>The solemn procession, headed by Baddeley, of tea-board, urn, and
cake-bearers, made its appearance, and delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from a grievous
imprisonment of body and mind. Mr. Crawford was obliged to move. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
at liberty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was busy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was protected.

<p/>Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those who
might speak and hear. But though the conference had seemed full long to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and though on looking at Fanny he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw rather a flush of vexation,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened
to without some profit to the speaker.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXV

<p/>Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse
whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned
between them or not; and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not lead the way, it should
never be touched on by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); but after a day or two of mutual reserve, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
was induced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind, and try what his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) influence
might do for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend.

<p/>A day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for the Crawfords'
departure; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one
more effort for the young man before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left Mansfield, that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)
professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to
sustain them as possible.

<p/>Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr.
Crawford's character in that point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to be a model of
constancy; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not
trying him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) too long.

<p/>Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
wanted to know Fanny's feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been used to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in
every difficulty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) too well to bear to be denied her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
confidence now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hoped to be of service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must be
of service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); whom else had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to open her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart to? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did
not need counsel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must need the comfort of communication. Fanny
estranged from him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>), silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of
things; a state which he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) must break through, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) could easily
learn to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) to break through.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), sir: I will take the first opportunity of speaking
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>was the result of such thoughts as these; and upon Sir
Thomas's information of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being at that very time walking alone in the
shrubbery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) instantly joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am come to walk with you, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Shall I?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
arm within his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) assented to it all rather by look than word. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits were low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) presently added, <div class="bookquote">``in order to have a comfortable walk,
something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together. You
must talk to me. I know you have something on your mind. I know what you
are thinking of. You cannot suppose me uninformed. Am I to hear of it
from everybody but Fanny herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny, at once agitated and dejected, replied, <div class="bookquote">``If you hear of it from
everybody, cousin, there can be nothing for me to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny. No one but you can tell
me them. I do not mean to press you, however. If it is not what you wish
yourself, I have done. I had thought it might be a relief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in
talking of what I feel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose that we think differently? I have no idea of it. I dare
say that, on a comparison of our opinions, they would be found as much
alike as they have been used to be: to the point--I consider Crawford's
proposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could return his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
affection. I consider it as most natural that all your family should
wish you could return it; but that, as you cannot, you have done exactly
as you ought in refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Can there be any disagreement between us
here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! But I thought you blamed me. I thought you were against me. This
is such a comfort!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you sought it. But
how could you possibly suppose me against you? How could you imagine me
an advocate for marriage without love? Were I even careless in general
on such matters, how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at
stake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had been talking to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right. I may be
sorry, I may be surprised--though hardly _that_, for you had not had
time to attach yourself--but I think you perfectly right. Can it admit
of a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>);
nothing could have justified your accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistaken
who wished you to do otherwise. But the matter does not end here.
Crawford's is no common attachment; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) perseveres, with the hope of
creating that regard which had not been created before. This, we know,
must be a work of time. But''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with an affectionate smile-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``let him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
succeed at last, Fanny, let him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) succeed at last. You have proved
yourself upright and disinterested, prove yourself grateful and
tender-hearted; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which
I have always believed you born for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! never, never, never! he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) never will succeed with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke
with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) blushed at
the recollection of herself, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) look, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
reply, <div class="bookquote">``Never! Fanny!--so very determined and positive! This is not like
yourself, your rational self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, sorrowfully correcting herself, <div class="bookquote">``that I _think_ I
never shall, as far as the future can be answered for; I think I never
shall return his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) regard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must hope better things. I am aware, more aware than Crawford can be,
that the man who means to make you love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -LRB-you having due notice of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intentions-RRB- must have very uphill work, for there are all your early
attachments and habits in battle array; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can get your heart
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own use he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things
animate and inanimate, which so many years' growth have confirmed, and
which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea
of separation. I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit
Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>). I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) had not
been obliged to tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) was trying for. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) had known you
as well as I do, Fanny. Between us, I think we should have won you. My
theoretical and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) practical knowledge together could not have failed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) should have worked upon my plans. I must hope, however, that time,
proving him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) -LRB-as I firmly believe it will-RRB- to deserve you by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) steady
affection, will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) reward. I cannot suppose that you have not
the _wish_ to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)--the natural wish of gratitude. You must have
some feeling of that sort. You must be sorry for your own indifference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are so totally unlike,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, avoiding a direct answer, <div class="bookquote">``we
are so very, very different in all our inclinations and ways, that
I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy
together, even if I _could_ like him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>). There never were two people more
dissimilar. We have not one taste in common. We should be miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken, Fanny. The dissimilarity is not so strong. You are
quite enough alike. You _have_ tastes in common. You have moral and
literary tastes in common. You have both warm hearts and benevolent
feelings; and, Fanny, who that heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) read, and saw you listen to
Shakespeare the other night, will think you unfitted as companions? You
forget yourself: there is a decided difference in your tempers, I allow.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) is lively, you are serious; but so much the better: his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) spirits will
support yours. It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy
difficulties greater than they are. His (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) cheerfulness will counteract
this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) sees difficulties nowhere: and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) pleasantness and gaiety will
be a constant support to you. Your being so far unlike, Fanny, does not
in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness
together: do not imagine it. I am myself convinced that it is rather a
favourable circumstance. I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers
had better be unlike: I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits, in
the manners, in the inclination for much or little company, in the
propensity to talk or to be silent, to be grave or to be gay. Some
opposition here is, I am thoroughly convinced, friendly to matrimonial
happiness. I exclude extremes, of course; and a very close resemblance
in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme.
A counteraction, gentle and continual, is the best safeguard of manners
and conduct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Full well could Fanny guess where his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thoughts were now: Miss Crawford's
power was all returning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cheerfully from the
hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) coming home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) avoiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was quite at an end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
dined at the Parsonage only the preceding day.

<p/>After leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) happier thoughts for some minutes, Fanny,
feeling it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford, and said, <div class="bookquote">``It
is not merely in _temper_ that I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as totally unsuited to
myself; though, in _that_ respect, I think the difference between us too
great, infinitely too great: his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spirits often oppress me; but there is
something in him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) which I object to still more. I must say, cousin, that
I cannot approve his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) character. I have not thought well of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) from the
time of the play. I then saw him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) behaving, as it appeared to me, so
very improperly and unfeelingly--I may speak of it now because it is all
over--so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care how he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
exposed or hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), and paying attentions to my cousin Maria, which--in
short, at the time of the play, I received an impression which will
never be got over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to the end, <div class="bookquote">``let
us not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period of
general folly. The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect.
Maria was wrong, Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong together; but
none so wrong as myself. Compared with me, all the rest were blameless.
I was playing the fool with my eyes open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a bystander,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps I saw more than you did; and I do
think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more improper than the whole
business. I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of
it; but, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could undertake the part, we must not be surprised at
the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Before the play, I am much mistaken if _Julia_ did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was
paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) attentions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Julia! I have heard before from some one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) being in love with
Julia; but I could never see anything of it. And, Fanny, though I hope I
do justice to my sisters' good qualities, I think it very possible that
they might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired by Crawford,
and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly
prudent. I can remember that they were evidently fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) society;
and with such encouragement, a man like Crawford, lively, and it may
be, a little unthinking, might be led on to--there could be nothing very
striking, because it is clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had no pretensions: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) heart was
reserved for you. And I must say, that its being for you has raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
inconceivably in my opinion. It does him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) the highest honour; it shews
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure
attachment. It proves him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) unspoilt by his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) uncle. It proves him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), in
short, everything that I had been used to wish to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), and
feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) does not think, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) ought, on serious
subjects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, rather, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) has not thought at all upon serious subjects,
which I believe to be a good deal the case. How could it be otherwise,
with such an education and adviser? Under the disadvantages, indeed,
which both have had, is it not wonderful that they should be what they
are? Crawford's _feelings_, I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto
been too much his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) guides. Happily, those feelings have generally been
good. You will supply the rest; and a most fortunate man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to attach
himself to such a creature--to a woman who, firm as a rock in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
principles, has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has chosen his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) partner, indeed, with rare felicity. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) will
make you happy, Fanny; I know he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) will make you happy; but you will make
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not engage in such a charge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, in a shrinking
accent; <div class="bookquote">``in such an office of high responsibility!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything! fancying everything
too much for you! Well, though I may not be able to persuade you into
different feelings, you will be persuaded into them, I trust. I confess
myself sincerely anxious that you may. I have no common interest in
Crawford's well-doing. Next to your happiness, Fanny, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has the first
claim on me. You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say; and they walked
on together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction. Edmund
first began again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very much pleased by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) manner of speaking of it yesterday,
particularly pleased, because I had not depended upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seeing
everything in so just a light. I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was very fond of you; but yet
I was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not estimating your worth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother quite as
it deserved, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) regretting that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not rather fixed on
some woman of distinction or fortune. I was afraid of the bias of those
worldly maxims, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has been too much used to hear. But it was
very different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke of you, Fanny, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) desires
the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself. We had a long talk
about it. I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxious
to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutes
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began introducing it with all that openness of heart, and
sweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are so
much a part of herself. Mrs. Grant laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) rapidity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Mrs. Grant in the room, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by
themselves; and when once we had begun, we had not done with you, Fanny,
till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) laments it; yet owns it may have been best. You will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),
however, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) goes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is very angry with you, Fanny; you must be
prepared for that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) calls herself very angry, but you can imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
anger. It is the regret and disappointment of a sister, who thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
brother has a right to everything he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) may wish for, at the first moment.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is hurt, as you would be for William; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) loves and esteems you
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be very angry with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>cried Edmund, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arm closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do
not let the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) anger distress you. It is anger to be talked
of rather than felt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart is made for love and kindness, not for
resentment. I wish you could have overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tribute of praise;
I wish you could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said that you
_should_ be Henry's wife. And I observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) always spoke of you
as `Fanny,' which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was never used to do; and it had a sound of most
sisterly cordiality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mrs. Grant, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) say--did she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) speak; was she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) there all the
time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was agreeing exactly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister. The surprise of your
refusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded. That you could refuse such
a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand. I said what
I could for you; but in good truth, as they stated the case--you must
prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different
conduct; nothing else will satisfy them. But this is teasing you. I have
done. Do not turn away from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _should_ have thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, after a pause of recollection and
exertion, <div class="bookquote">``that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man's
not being approved, not being loved by some one of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sex at least, let
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be ever so generally agreeable. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have all the perfections
in the world, I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man
must be acceptable to every woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may happen to like himself. But,
even supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sisters think he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has, how was I to be prepared to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
with any feeling answerable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own? He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) took me wholly by surprise.
I had not an idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) behaviour to me before had any meaning; and
surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
taking what seemed very idle notice of me. In my situation, it would
have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr.
Crawford. I am sure his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sisters, rating him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) as they do, must have
thought it so, supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had meant nothing. How, then, was I to
be--to be in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was with me? How was I
to have an attachment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) service, as soon as it was asked for? His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
sisters should consider me as well as him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). The higher his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) deserts, the
more improper for me ever to have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). And, and--we think
very differently of the nature of women, if they can imagine a woman so
very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth. I know this to be the truth;
and most worthy of you are such feelings. I had attributed them to you
before. I thought I could understand you. You have now given exactly
the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs.
Grant, and they were both better satisfied, though your warm-hearted
friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
fondness for Henry. I told them that you were of all human creatures the
one over whom habit had most power and novelty least; and that the very
circumstance of the novelty of Crawford's addresses was against him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour; that you
could tolerate nothing that you were not used to; and a great deal more
to the same purpose, to give them a knowledge of your character. Miss
Crawford made us laugh by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) plans of encouragement for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meant to urge him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to persevere in the hope of being loved in time,
and of having his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten
years' happy marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
feelings were all in revolt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feared she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been doing wrong: saying
too much, overacting the caution which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been fancying necessary;
in guarding against one evil, laying herself open to another; and to
have Miss Crawford's liveliness repeated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at such a moment, and on
such a subject, was a bitter aggravation.

<p/>Edmund saw weariness and distress in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) face, and immediately resolved
to forbear all farther discussion; and not even to mention the name
of Crawford again, except as it might be connected with what _must_ be
agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). On this principle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) soon afterwards observed--<div class="bookquote">``They
go on Monday. You are sure, therefore, of seeing your friend either
to-morrow or Sunday. They really go on Monday; and I was within a trifle
of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day! I had almost
promised it. What a difference it might have made! Those five or six
days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were near staying there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very. I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly consented. Had I
received any letter from Mansfield, to tell me how you were all going
on, I believe I should certainly have staid; but I knew nothing that
had happened here for a fortnight, and felt that I had been away long
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You spent your time pleasantly there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not. They were
all very pleasant. I doubt their finding me so. I took uneasiness with
me, and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Miss Owens--you liked them, did not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very well. Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls. But I am
spoilt, Fanny, for common female society. Good-humoured, unaffected
girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They
are two distinct orders of being. You and Miss Crawford have made me too
nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Still, however, Fanny was oppressed and wearied; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looks,
it could not be talked away; and attempting it no more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
directly, with the kind authority of a privileged guardian, into the
house.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI

<p/>Edmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fanny
could tell, or could leave to be conjectured of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sentiments, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
was satisfied. It had been, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) before presumed, too hasty a measure
on Crawford's side, and time must be given to make the idea first
familiar, and then agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must be used to the
consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and then a return of
affection might not be very distant.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father;
and recommended there being nothing more said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>): no farther
attempts to influence or persuade; but that everything should be left to
Crawford's assiduities, and the natural workings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own mind.

<p/>Sir Thomas promised that it should be so. Edmund's account of Fanny's
disposition he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could believe to be just; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had all those
feelings, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must consider it as very unfortunate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _had_;
for, less willing than his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) son to trust to the future, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not
help fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were
necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might not have persuaded herself into receiving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) addresses properly before the young man's inclination for paying
them were over. There was nothing to be done, however, but to submit
quietly and hope the best.

<p/>The promised visit from <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>as Edmund called Miss Crawford,
was a formidable threat to Fanny, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lived in continual terror of
it. As a sister, so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, and in another light so triumphant and secure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in
every way an object of painful alarm. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) displeasure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) penetration,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness were all fearful to encounter; and the dependence of
having others present when they met was Fanny's only support in looking
forward to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) absented herself as little as possible from Lady
Bertram, kept away from the East room, and took no solitary walk in the
shrubbery, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) caution to avoid any sudden attack.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) succeeded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was safe in the breakfast-room, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) aunt, when
Miss Crawford did come; and the first misery over, and Miss Crawford
looking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had anticipated, Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse to be
endured than a half-hour of moderate agitation. But here she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped too
much; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was determined
to see Fanny alone, and therefore said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tolerably soon, in a low
voice, <div class="bookquote">``I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere'' (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>; words that
Fanny felt all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pulses and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nerves. Denial
was impossible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) habits of ready submission, on the contrary, made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) almost instantly rise and lead the way out of the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did it
with wretched feelings, but it was inevitable.

<p/>They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance was
over on Miss Crawford's side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) immediately shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) head at Fanny
with arch, yet affectionate reproach, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hand, seemed hardly
able to help beginning directly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said nothing, however, but, <div class="bookquote">``Sad,
sad girl! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and had
discretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure of
having four walls to themselves. Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortable
use; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart, and feeling
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had a more distressing scene before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than ever that spot had
yet witnessed. But the evil ready to burst on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was at least delayed
by the sudden change in Miss Crawford's ideas; by the strong effect on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind which the finding herself in the East room again produced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cried, with instant animation, <div class="bookquote">``am I here again? The East
room! Once only was I in this room before'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and after stopping to look
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and seemingly to retrace all that had then passed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``Once only before. Do you remember it? I came to rehearse. Your cousin
came too; and we had a rehearsal. You were our audience and prompter.
A delightful rehearsal. I shall never forget it. Here we were, just in
this part of the room: here was your cousin, here was I, here were the
chairs. Oh! why will such things ever pass away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Happily for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) companion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wanted no answer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind was entirely
self-engrossed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was in a reverie of sweet remembrances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable! The subject of
it so very--very--what shall I say? He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was to be describing and
recommending matrimony to me. I think I see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) now, trying to be as
demure and composed as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches.
`When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony
may be called a happy life.' I suppose no time can ever wear out the
impression I have of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) looks and voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said those words. It was
curious, very curious, that we should have such a scene to play! If I
had the power of recalling any one week of my existence, it should be
that week--that acting week. Say what you would, Fanny, it should be
_that_; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. His (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
sturdy spirit to bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression. But
alas, that very evening destroyed it all. That very evening brought your
most unwelcome uncle. Poor Sir Thomas, who was glad to see you? Yet,
Fanny, do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas,
though I certainly did hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) for many a week. No, I do him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) justice
now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) is just what the head of such a family should be. Nay, in sober
sadness, I believe I now love you all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>And having said so, with a
degree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
before, and now thought only too becoming, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) turned away for a moment
to recover herself. <div class="bookquote">``I have had a little fit since I came into this
room, as you may perceive,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) presently, with a playful smile,
<div class="bookquote">``but it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for as to
scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have not
the heart for it when it comes to the point.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very
affectionately, <div class="bookquote">``Good, gentle Fanny! when I think of this being the
last time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite
impossible to do anything but love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was affected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not foreseen anything of this, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word
<div class="bookquote">``last.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had loved Miss Crawford more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
possibly could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight of
such emotion, hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with fondness, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I hate to leave
you. I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going. Who says we
shall not be sisters? I know we shall. I feel that we are born to
be connected; and those tears convince me that you feel it too, dear
Fanny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said, <div class="bookquote">``But you are
only going from one set of friends to another. You are going to a very
particular friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very true. Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years. But
I have not the least inclination to go near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>). I can think only of the
friends I am leaving: my excellent sister, yourself, and the Bertrams in
general. You have all so much more _heart_ among you than one finds in
the world at large. You all give me a feeling of being able to trust and
confide in you, which in common intercourse one knows nothing of. I wish
I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) till after Easter, a
much better time for the visit, but now I cannot put her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) off. And when
I have done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) I must go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) sister, Lady Stornaway, because
_she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)_ was rather my most particular friend of the two, but I have not
cared much for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)_ these three years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>After this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent, each
thoughtful: Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in the
world, Mary on something of less philosophic tendency. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)_ first spoke
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs, and
setting off to find my way to the East room, without having an idea
whereabouts it was! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came
along, and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at
work; and then your cousin's astonishment, when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) opened the door, at
seeing me here! To be sure, your uncle's returning that very evening!
There never was anything quite like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Another short fit of abstraction followed, when, shaking it off, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
thus attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of one
who is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for a
short time into our circle in town, that you might understand how your
power over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and heartburnings
of dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that will be felt at
hearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the hero
of an old romance, and glories in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chains. You should come to London
to know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is
courted, and how I am courted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sake! Now, I am well aware that
I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
situation with you. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) comes to know the truth she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) will, very
likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is a daughter of
Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is wild to get married, and
wants Henry to take. Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has been trying for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to such a degree.
Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an idea of the
_sensation_ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity there will
be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to answer! Poor
Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth,
and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish Margaret were
married, for my poor friend's sake, for I look upon the Frasers to be
about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it was a most
desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all delighted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) could
not do otherwise than accept him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was rich, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) had nothing;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turns out ill-tempered and _exigeant_, and wants a young woman,
a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be as steady as himself.
And my friend does not manage him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) well; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not seem to know how
to make the best of it. There is a spirit of irritation which, to say
nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In their house I shall call
to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect. Even
Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister, and a certain
consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) judgment, which makes one feel there _is_
attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers. I shall
be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as a wife, Sir Thomas
Bertram as a husband, are my standards of perfection. Poor Janet has
been sadly taken in, and yet there was nothing improper on her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) side:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) did not run into the match inconsiderately; there was no want of
foresight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) took three days to consider of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) proposals, and during
those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) whose
opinion was worth having, and especially applied to my late dear aunt,
whose knowledge of the world made her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) judgment very generally and
deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) acquaintance, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were
a security for matrimonial comfort. I have not so much to say for my
friend Flora, who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake
of that horrid Lord Stornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as
Mr. Rushworth, but much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character.
I _had_ my doubts at the time about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being right, for he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has not even
the air of a gentleman, and now I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was wrong. By the bye,
Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) came out. But were I
to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), I should never have done. It is you, only you, insensible
Fanny, who can think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with anything like indifference. But are you
so insensible as you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>There was, indeed, so deep a blush over Fanny's face at that moment as
might warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent creature! I will not tease you. Everything shall take its
course. But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutely
unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies. It is not
possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject, some
surmises as to what might be. You must have seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was trying to
please you by every attention in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) power. Was not he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) devoted to you
at the ball? And then before the ball, the necklace! Oh! you received
it just as it was meant. You were as conscious as heart could desire. I
remember it perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean, then, that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand?
Oh! Miss Crawford, _that_ was not fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Knew of it! It was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own doing entirely, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own thought. I am
ashamed to say that it had never entered my head, but I was delighted to
act on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) proposal for both your sakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>replied Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``that I was not half afraid at the time
of its being so, for there was something in your look that frightened
me, but not at first; I was as unsuspicious of it at first--indeed,
indeed I was. It is as true as that I sit here. And had I had an idea
of it, nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace. As to your
brother's behaviour, certainly I was sensible of a particularity: I had
been sensible of it some little time, perhaps two or three weeks; but
then I considered it as meaning nothing: I put it down as simply being
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) way, and was as far from supposing as from wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to have any
serious thoughts of me. I had not, Miss Crawford, been an inattentive
observer of what was passing between him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and some part of this family in
the summer and autumn. I was quiet, but I was not blind. I could not
but see that Mr. Crawford allowed himself in gallantries which did mean
nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I cannot deny it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has now and then been a sad flirt, and
cared very little for the havoc he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might be making in young ladies'
affections. I have often scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for it, but it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only fault;
and there is this to be said, that very few young ladies have any
affections worth caring for. And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one
who has been shot at by so many; of having it in one's power to pay off
the debts of one's sex! Oh! I am sure it is not in woman's nature to
refuse such a triumph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot think well of a man who sports with any
woman's feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than
a stander-by can judge of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not defend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entirely to your mercy, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has got you at Everingham, I do not care how much you lecture him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But
this I will say, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fault, the liking to make girls a little
in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), is not half so dangerous to a wife's happiness as a
tendency to fall in love himself, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has never been addicted to.
And I do seriously and truly believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is attached to you in a way
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never was to any woman before; that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves you with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
heart, and will love you as nearly for ever as possible. If any man ever
loved a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as much for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div>continued Mary
presently, <div class="bookquote">``than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had succeeded in getting your brother's
commission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had made a sure push at Fanny's feelings here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes. How very, very kind of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must have exerted himself very much, for I know the parties
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had to move. The Admiral hates trouble, and scorns asking favours;
and there are so many young men's claims to be attended to in the same
way, that a friendship and energy, not very determined, is easily put
by. What a happy creature William must be! I wish we could see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Fanny's mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its
varieties. The recollection of what had been done for William was always
the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been first watching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) complacently, and then musing on something else, suddenly called
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) attention by saying: <div class="bookquote">``I should like to sit talking with you here all
day, but we must not forget the ladies below, and so good-bye, my dear,
my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall nominally part in
the breakfast-parlour, I must take leave of you here. And I do take
leave, longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meet
again, it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each
other without any remnant or shadow of reserve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>A very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner, accompanied
these words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall see your cousin in town soon: he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) talks of being there tolerably
soon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say, in the course of the spring; and your
eldest cousin, and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am sure of meeting again
and again, and all but you. I have two favours to ask, Fanny: one is
your correspondence. You must write to me. And the other, that you will
often call on Mrs. Grant, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) amends for my being gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>The first, at least, of these favours Fanny would rather not have been
asked; but it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to refuse the correspondence; it
was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) even not to accede to it more readily than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own judgment authorised. There was no resisting so much apparent
affection. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond
treatment, and from having hitherto known so little of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was the
more overcome by Miss Crawford's. Besides, there was gratitude towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), for having made their _tete-a-tete_ so much less painful than her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
fears had predicted.

<p/>It was over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had escaped without reproaches and without
detection. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) secret was still her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own; and while that was the case,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could resign herself to almost everything.

<p/>In the evening there was another parting. Henry Crawford came and
sat some time with them; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spirits not being previously in the
strongest state, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart was softened for a while towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) really seemed to feel. Quite unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) usual self, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) scarcely said
anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was evidently oppressed, and Fanny must grieve for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),
though hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again till he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) were the husband of
some other woman.

<p/>When it came to the moment of parting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would
not be denied it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said nothing, however, or nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had left the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was better pleased that such a token
of friendship had passed.

<p/>On the morrow the Crawfords were gone.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVII

<p/>Mr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas's next object was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should be
missed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) entertained great hope that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) niece would find a blank
in the loss of those attentions which at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had felt, or
fancied, an evil. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had tasted of consequence in its most flattering
form; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did hope that the loss of it, the sinking again into
nothing, would awaken very wholesome regrets in her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
with this idea; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could hardly tell with what success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hardly
knew whether there were any difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) spirits or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
was always so gentle and retiring that her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) emotions were beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
discrimination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not; and
therefore applied to Edmund to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) stood affected on the
present occasion, and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) were more or less happy than she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had
been.

<p/>Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father
a little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could
produce any.

<p/>What chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford's sister, the friend
and companion who had been so much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), should not be more visibly
regretted. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_, and had so
little voluntarily to say of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) concern at this separation.

<p/>Alas! it was this sister, this friend and companion, who was now the
chief bane of Fanny's comfort. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have believed Mary's future
fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was determined the brother's
should be, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have hoped her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) return thither to be as distant
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was much inclined to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have been light of
heart indeed; but the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recollected and observed, the more deeply
was she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss
Crawford's marrying Edmund than it had ever been before. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) side the
inclination was stronger, on hers less equivocal. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) objections, the
scruples of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) integrity, seemed all done away, nobody could tell
how; and the doubts and hesitations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) ambition were equally got
over--and equally without apparent reason. It could only be imputed to
increasing attachment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) good and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) bad feelings yielded to love,
and such love must unite them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was to go to town as soon as some
business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed--perhaps within a
fortnight; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) talked of going, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) loved to talk of it; and when once
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again, Fanny could not doubt the rest. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) acceptance must be
as certain as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) offer; and yet there were bad feelings still remaining
which made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), independently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
believed, independently of self.

<p/>In their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite of some amiable
sensations, and much personal kindness, had still been Miss Crawford;
still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered, and without any suspicion
of being so; darkened, yet fancying itself light. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might love, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment. Fanny believed there
was scarcely a second feeling in common between them; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) may be
forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford's
future improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking that if Edmund's
influence in this season of love had already done so little in clearing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) judgment, and regulating her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) notions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) worth would be finally
wasted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) even in years of matrimony.

<p/>Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced,
and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford's nature that
participation of the general nature of women which would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to
adopt the opinions of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) loved and respected as her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own. But
as such were Fanny's persuasions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) suffered very much from them, and
could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.

<p/>Sir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own hopes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own
observations, still feeling a right, by all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) knowledge of human
nature, to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece's spirits, and the past attentions of the lover producing a
craving for their return; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was soon afterwards able to account for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this, by the prospect
of another visitor, whose approach he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could allow to be quite enough to
support the spirits he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was watching. William had obtained a ten days'
leave of absence, to be given to Northamptonshire, and was coming, the
happiest of lieutenants, because the latest made, to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) happiness
and describe his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uniform.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) came; and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would have been delighted to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uniform there too,
had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty. So the
uniform remained at Portsmouth, and Edmund conjectured that before Fanny
had any chance of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the freshness
of its wearer's feelings must be worn away. It would be sunk into a
badge of disgrace; for what can be more unbecoming, or more worthless,
than the uniform of a lieutenant, who has been a lieutenant a year or
two, and sees others made commanders before him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>)? So reasoned Edmund,
till his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father made him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the confidant of a scheme which placed Fanny's
chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) glory
in another light.

<p/>This scheme was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother back to
Portsmouth, and spend a little time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own family. It had occurred
to Sir Thomas, in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) dignified musings, as a right and desirable
measure; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) absolutely made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
son. Edmund considered it every way, and saw nothing but what was right.
The thing was good in itself, and could not be done at a better time;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to Fanny. This was
enough to determine Sir Thomas; and a decisive <div class="bookquote">``then so it shall be''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>closed that stage of the business; Sir Thomas retiring from it with some
feelings of satisfaction, and views of good over and above what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had
communicated to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) prime motive in sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) away had
very little to do with the propriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents again,
and nothing at all with any idea of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) certainly
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to go willingly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) as certainly wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be
heartily sick of home before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) visit ended; and that a little
abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park would
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind into a sober state, and incline her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to a juster estimate
of the value of that home of greater permanence, and equal comfort, of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had the offer.

<p/>It was a medicinal project upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece's understanding, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must
consider as at present diseased. A residence of eight or nine years in
the abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) powers of
comparing and judging. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's house would, in all probability,
teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the value of a good income; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trusted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be
the wiser and happier woman, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life, for the experiment he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
devised.

<p/>Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have had a strong
attack of them when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first understood what was intended, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
uncle first made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,
and sisters, from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been divided almost half her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life; of
returning for a couple of months to the scenes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) infancy, with
William for the protector and companion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) journey, and the
certainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) remaining
on land. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ever given way to bursts of delight, it must have been
then, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was delighted, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness was of a quiet, deep,
heart-swelling sort; and though never a great talker, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was always
more inclined to silence when feeling most strongly. At the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could only thank and accept. Afterwards, when familiarised with the
visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could speak more largely
to William and Edmund of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt; but still there were emotions
of tenderness that could not be clothed in words. The remembrance of all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) earliest pleasures, and of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had suffered in being torn from
them, came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with renewed strength, and it seemed as if to be
at home again would heal every pain that had since grown out of the
separation. To be in the centre of such a circle, loved by so many,
and more loved by all than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had ever been before; to feel affection
without fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal of those who
surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); to be at peace from all mention of the Crawfords, safe
from every look which could be fancied a reproach on their account. This
was a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that could be but half
acknowledged.

<p/>Edmund, too--to be two months from _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ -LRB-and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might be
allowed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) absence three-RRB- must do her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good. At a distance,
unassailed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) looks or his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) kindness, and safe from the perpetual
irritation of knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart, and striving to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) confidence,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should
be able to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) as in London, and arranging everything there,
without wretchedness. What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield was
to become a slight evil at Portsmouth.

<p/>The only drawback was the doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram's being comfortable
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was of use to no one else; but _there_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might be
missed to a degree that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not like to think of; and that part of
the arrangement was, indeed, the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish,
and what only _he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)_ could have accomplished at all.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was master at Mansfield Park. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had really resolved on
any measure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could always carry it through; and now by dint of long
talking on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny's
sometimes seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) family, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did induce his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) go;
obtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction, for Lady
Bertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought
Fanny ought to go, and therefore that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must. In the calmness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own dressing-room, in the impartial flow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own meditations,
unbiassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) bewildering statements, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not acknowledge any
necessity for Fanny's ever going near a father and mother who had done
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so long, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was so useful to herself. And as to the
not missing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), which under Mrs. Norris's discussion was the point
attempted to be proved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) set herself very steadily against admitting
any such thing.

<p/>Sir Thomas had appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) reason, conscience, and dignity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
called it a sacrifice, and demanded it of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) goodness and self-command
as such. But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) that Fanny could be very
well spared--_she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ being ready to give up all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own time to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as
requested--and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>was all Lady Bertram's reply. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say you are
very right; but I am sure I shall miss her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The next step was to communicate with Portsmouth. Fanny wrote to offer
herself; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's answer, though short, was so kind--a few
simple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect
of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) child again, as to confirm all the daughter's views of
happiness in being with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)--convincing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should now find a
warm and affectionate friend in the <div class="bookquote">``mama''  (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>who had certainly shewn no
remarkable fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) formerly; but this she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could easily suppose
to have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own fault or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own fancy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had probably alienated
love by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper, or been
unreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many could
deserve. Now, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew better how to be useful, and how to forbear,
and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother could be no longer occupied by the incessant
demands of a house full of little children, there would be leisure and
inclination for every comfort, and they should soon be what mother and
daughter ought to be to each other.

<p/>William was almost as happy in the plan as his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister. It would be the
greatest pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to have her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) there to the last moment before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
sailed, and perhaps find her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) there still when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) came in from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) first
cruise. And besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so very much to see the Thrush before
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went out of harbour--the Thrush was certainly the finest sloop in
the service--and there were several improvements in the dockyard, too,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) quite longed to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) did not scruple to add that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) being at home for a while would be a
great advantage to everybody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know how it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but we seem to want some of
your nice ways and orderliness at my father's. The house is always in
confusion. You will set things going in a better way, I am sure. You
will tell my mother how it all ought to be, and you will be so useful to
Susan, and you will teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind you.
How right and comfortable it will all be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By the time Mrs. Price's answer arrived, there remained but a very few
days more to be spent at Mansfield; and for part of one of those days
the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of
their journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of, and Mrs.
Norris found that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) anxiety to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) brother-in-law's money
was vain, and that in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) wishes and hints for a less expensive
conveyance of Fanny, they were to travel post; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw Sir Thomas
actually give William notes for the purpose, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was struck with the
idea of there being room for a third in the carriage, and suddenly
seized with a strong inclination to go with them, to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor
dear sister Price. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) proclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had more than half a mind to go with the young people; it would be such
an indulgence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor dear sister Price for
more than twenty years; and it would be a help to the young people in
their journey to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) older head to manage for them; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
not help thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkind
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not to come by such an opportunity.

<p/>William and Fanny were horror-struck at the idea.

<p/>All the comfort of their comfortable journey would be destroyed at
once. With woeful countenances they looked at each other. Their suspense
lasted an hour or two. No one interfered to encourage or dissuade. Mrs.
Norris was left to settle the matter by herself; and it ended, to the
infinite joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nephew and niece, in the recollection that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could
not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was a
great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to
be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week, and
therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being
useful to them.

<p/>It had, in fact, occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), that though taken to Portsmouth for
nothing, it would be hardly possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to avoid paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own
expenses back again. So her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) poor dear sister Price was left to all the
disappointment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) missing such an opportunity, and another twenty
years' absence, perhaps, begun.

<p/>Edmund's plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey, this absence of
Fanny's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
aunt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had intended, about this time, to be going to London; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
could not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father and mother just when everybody else of most
importance to their comfort was leaving them; and with an effort, felt
but not boasted of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) delayed for a week or two longer a journey which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) happiness for
ever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) told Fanny of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew so much already, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must know
everything. It made the substance of one other confidential discourse
about Miss Crawford; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to
be the last time in which Miss Crawford's name would ever be mentioned
between them with any remains of liberty. Once afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
alluded to by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). Lady Bertram had been telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) niece in the
evening to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) soon and often, and promising to be a good
correspondent herself; and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then added
in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``And _I_ shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything
worth writing about, anything to say that I think you will like to hear,
and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund/Mr. Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) meaning while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) listened, the glow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) face, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), would have been decisive.

<p/>For this letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) must try to arm herself. That a letter from Edmund
should be a subject of terror! She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) began to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had not yet
gone through all the changes of opinion and sentiment which the progress
of time and variation of circumstances occasion in this world of
changes. The vicissitudes of the human mind had not yet been exhausted
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>).

<p/>Poor Fanny! though going as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did willingly and eagerly, the last
evening at Mansfield Park must still be wretchedness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart was
completely sad at parting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had tears for every room in the house,
much more for every beloved inhabitant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) kissed the hand of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle with struggling
sobs, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>); and as for Edmund, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
neither speak, nor look, nor think, when the last moment came with
_him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_; and it was not till it was over that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
the affectionate farewell of a brother.

<p/>All this passed overnight, for the journey was to begin very early in
the morning; and when the small, diminished party met at breakfast,
William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII

<p/>The novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being with William, soon
produced their natural effect on Fanny's spirits, when Mansfield Park
was fairly left behind; and by the time their first stage was ended, and
they were to quit Sir Thomas's carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was able to take leave of
the old coachman, and send back proper messages, with cheerful looks.

<p/>Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end.
Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William's mind, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher-toned
subjects, all of which ended, if they did not begin, in praise of the
Thrush, conjectures how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would be employed, schemes for an action
with some superior force, which -LRB-supposing the first lieutenant out of
the way, and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant-RRB- was
to give himself the next step as soon as possible, or speculations upon
prize-money, which was to be generously distributed at home, with only
the reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable,
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life
together.

<p/>Fanny's immediate concerns, as far as they involved Mr. Crawford, made
no part of their conversation. William knew what had passed, and from
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heart lamented that his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister's feelings should be so cold towards
a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must consider as the first of human characters; but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
of an age to be all for love, and therefore unable to blame; and knowing
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wish on the subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would not distress her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) by the slightest
allusion.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
had heard repeatedly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister within the three weeks which had
passed since their leaving Mansfield, and in each letter there had been
a few lines from himself, warm and determined like his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) speeches. It
was a correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
feared. Miss Crawford's style of writing, lively and affectionate, was
itself an evil, independent of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was thus forced into reading
from the brother's pen, for Edmund would never rest till she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had read
the chief of the letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had to listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) language, and the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attachments. There
had, in fact, been so much of message, of allusion, of recollection, so
much of Mansfield in every letter, that Fanny could not but suppose it
meant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to hear; and to find herself forced into a purpose of
that kind, compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the
addresses of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not love, and obliging her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to administer
to the adverse passion of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did, was cruelly mortifying. Here,
too, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) present removal promised advantage. When no longer under the
same roof with Edmund, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) trusted that Miss Crawford would have no
motive for writing strong enough to overcome the trouble, and that at
Portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into nothing.

<p/>With such thoughts as these, among ten hundred others, Fanny proceeded
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) journey safely and cheerfully, and as expeditiously as could
rationally be hoped in the dirty month of February. They entered Oxford,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund's college as they
passed along, and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury, where
a comfortable meal, uniting dinner and supper, wound up the enjoyments
and fatigues of the day.

<p/>The next morning saw them off again at an early hour; and with no
events, and no delays, they regularly advanced, and were in the environs
of Portsmouth while there was yet daylight for Fanny to look around her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
and wonder at the new buildings. They passed the drawbridge, and
entered the town; and the light was only beginning to fail as, guided
by William's powerful voice, they were rattled into a narrow street,
leading from the High Street, and drawn up before the door of a small
house now inhabited by Mr. Price.

<p/>Fanny was all agitation and flutter; all hope and apprehension. The
moment they stopped, a trollopy-looking maidservant, seemingly in
waiting for them at the door, stepped forward, and more intent on
telling the news than giving them any help, immediately began with, <div class="bookquote">``The
Thrush is gone out of harbour, please sir, and one of the officers has
been here to--''  (<font color='red'><b>a maidservant</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven years
old, who, rushing out of the house, pushed the maid aside, and while
William was opening the chaise-door himself, called out, <div class="bookquote">``You are just
in time. We have been looking for you this half-hour. The Thrush went
out of harbour this morning. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). It was a beautiful sight. And
they think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) orders in a day or two. And Mr. Campbell
was here at four o’clock to ask for you: he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) has got one of the Thrush's
boats, and is going off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at six, and hoped you would be here in
time to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div><p/>A stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) out of the carriage, was
all the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) made no
objection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), though still entirely engaged in detailing
farther particulars of the Thrush's going out of harbour, in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) had a strong right of interest, being to commence his (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) career of
seamanship in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at this very time.

<p/>Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage of the
house, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's arms, who met her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) there with looks of true
kindness, and with features which Fanny loved the more, because they
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram's before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and there were her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) two sisters:
Susan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey, the youngest of
the family, about five--both glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) in their way, though with
no advantage of manner in receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>). But manner Fanny did not want.
Would they but love her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be satisfied.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was then taken into a parlour, so small that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first conviction
was of its being only a passage-room to something better, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stood
for a moment expecting to be invited on; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw there was
no other door, and that there were signs of habitation before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
called back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved lest they should
have been suspected. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, however, could not stay long enough
to suspect anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was gone again to the street-door, to welcome
William. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you. But have you
heard about the Thrush? She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is gone out of harbour already; three days
before we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do about
Sam's things, they will never be ready in time; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) may have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
orders to-morrow, perhaps. It takes me quite unawares. And now you must
be off for Spithead too. Campbell has been here, quite in a worry about
you; and now what shall we do? I thought to have had such a comfortable
evening with you, and here everything comes upon me at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) son answered cheerfully, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that everything was always for
the best; and making light of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own inconvenience in being obliged to
hurry away so soon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, I had much rather she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had stayed in harbour, that I might
have sat a few hours with you in comfort; but as there is a boat ashore,
I had better go off at once, and there is no help for it. Whereabouts
does the Thrush lay at Spithead? Near the Canopus? But no matter; here's
Fanny in the parlour, and why should we stay in the passage? Come,
mother, you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div><p/>In they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughter
again, and commented a little on her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) growth, began with very natural
solicitude to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor dears! how tired you must both be! and now, what will you have? I
began to think you would never come. Betsey and I have been watching for
you this half-hour. And when did you get anything to eat? And what would
you like to have now? I could not tell whether you would be for some
meat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey, or else I would have
got something ready. And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before
there is time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand. It is
very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street. We were better off
in our last house. Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be
got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They both declared they should prefer it to anything. <div class="bookquote">``Then, Betsey, my
dear, run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on; and
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) to bring in the tea-things as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) can. I wish we could
get the bell mended; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Betsey</b></font>)</div><p/>Betsey went with alacrity, proud to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) abilities before her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) fine
new sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>continued the anxious mother, <div class="bookquote">``what a sad fire we have got,
and I dare say you are both starved with cold. Draw your chair nearer,
my dear. I cannot think what Rebecca has been about. I am sure I told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) to bring some coals half an hour ago. Susan, you should have taken
care of the fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was upstairs, mama, moving my things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, in a fearless,
self-defending tone, which startled Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``You know you had but just
settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room; and I
could not get Rebecca to give me any help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles: first, the driver
came to be paid; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca about
the manner of carrying up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister's trunk, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would manage all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own way; and lastly, in walked Mr. Price himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) own loud voice
preceding him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), as with something of the oath kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) kicked away his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
son's port-manteau and his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughter's bandbox in the passage, and called
out for a candle; no candle was brought, however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) walked into the
room.

<p/>Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), but sank down again
on finding herself undistinguished in the dusk, and unthought of. With
a friendly shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) son's hand, and an eager voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) instantly
began--<div class="bookquote">``Ha! welcome back, my boy. Glad to see you. Have you heard the
news? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning. Sharp is the
word, you see! By G--, you are just in time! The doctor has been here
inquiring for you: he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has got one of the boats, and is to be off for
Spithead by six, so you had better go with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). I have been to Turner's
about your mess; it is all in a way to be done. I should not wonder if
you had your orders to-morrow: but you cannot sail with this wind, if
you are to cruise to the westward; and Captain Walsh thinks you will
certainly have a cruise to the westward, with the Elephant. By G--, I
wish you may! But old Scholey was saying, just now, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walsh</b></font>) thought you
would be sent first to the Texel. Well, well, we are ready, whatever
happens. But by G--, you lost a fine sight by not being here in the
morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour! I would not have been out
of the way for a thousand pounds. Old Scholey ran in at breakfast-time,
to say she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) moorings and was coming out, I jumped up, and
made but two steps to the platform. If ever there was a perfect beauty
afloat, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is one; and there she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lays at Spithead, and anybody in
England would take her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for an eight-and-twenty. I was upon the platform
two hours this afternoon looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lays close to the Endymion,
between her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward of the sheer hulk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div>cried William, <div class="bookquote">``_that's_ just where I should have put her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) myself.
It's the best berth at Spithead. But here is my sister, sir; here is
Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div>turning and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) forward; <div class="bookquote">``it is so dark you do not see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With an acknowledgment that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had quite forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), Mr. Price now
received his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughter; and having given her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a cordial hug, and observed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was grown into a woman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) supposed would be wanting a
husband soon, seemed very much inclined to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) again. Fanny
shrunk back to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) seat, with feelings sadly pained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) language and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) smell of spirits; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) talked on only to his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) son, and only of the
Thrush, though William, warmly interested as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in that subject,
more than once tried to make his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father think of Fanny, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) long
absence and long journey.

<p/>After sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained; but as there was
still no appearance of tea, nor, from Betsey's reports from the kitchen,
much hope of any under a considerable period, William determined to
go and change his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) dress, and make the necessary preparations for
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) removal on board directly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might have his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) tea in comfort
afterwards.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) left the room, two rosy-faced boys, ragged and dirty, about eight
and nine years old, rushed into it just released from school, and coming
eagerly to see their sister, and tell that the Thrush was gone out of
harbour; Tom and Charles. Charles had been born since Fanny's going
away, but Tom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had often helped to nurse, and now felt a particular
pleasure in seeing again. Both were kissed very tenderly, but Tom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
wanted to keep by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), to try to trace the features of the baby she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
loved, and talked to, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) infant preference of herself. Tom, however,
had no mind for such treatment: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came home not to stand and be talked
to, but to run about and make a noise; and both boys had soon burst from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and slammed the parlour-door till her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) temples ached.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had now seen all that were at home; there remained only two brothers
between herself and Susan, one of whom was a clerk in a public office
in London, and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman. But though she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)
had _seen_ all the members of the family, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had not yet _heard_ all
the noise they could make. Another quarter of an hour brought her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) a
great deal more. William was soon calling out from the landing-place of
the second story for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother and for Rebecca. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in distress
for something that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had left there, and did not find again. A key was
mislaid, Betsey accused of having got at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) new hat, and some slight,
but essential alteration of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uniform waistcoat, which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been
promised to have done for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), entirely neglected.

<p/>Mrs. Price, Rebecca, and Betsey all went up to defend themselves, all
talking together, but Rebecca loudest, and the job was to be done as
well as it could in a great hurry; William trying in vain to send Betsey
down again, or keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) from being troublesome where she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) was; the whole
of which, as almost every door in the house was open, could be plainly
distinguished in the parlour, except when drowned at intervals by the
superior noise of Sam, Tom, and Charles chasing each other up and down
stairs, and tumbling about and hallooing.

<p/>Fanny was almost stunned. The smallness of the house and thinness of the
walls brought everything so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), that, added to the fatigue of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) journey, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recent agitation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hardly knew how to
bear it. _Within_ the room all was tranquil enough, for Susan having
disappeared with the others, there were soon only her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father and herself
remaining; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), taking out a newspaper, the accustomary loan of a
neighbour, applied himself to studying it, without seeming to recollect
her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) existence. The solitary candle was held between himself and the
paper, without any reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) possible convenience; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had
nothing to do, and was glad to have the light screened from her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) aching
head, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) sat in bewildered, broken, sorrowful contemplation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was at home. But, alas! it was not such a home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had not such a
welcome, as--she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) checked herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was unreasonable. What right had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) to be of importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) family? She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could have none, so long lost
sight of! William's concerns must be dearest, they always had been, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had every right. Yet to have so little said or asked about herself,
to have scarcely an inquiry made after Mansfield! It did pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) to
have Mansfield forgotten; the friends who had done so much--the dear,
dear friends! But here, one subject swallowed up all the rest. Perhaps
it must be so. The destination of the Thrush must be now preeminently
interesting. A day or two might shew the difference. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)_ only was to
blame. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) thought it would not have been so at Mansfield. No, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) uncle's house there would have been a consideration of times and
seasons, a regulation of subject, a propriety, an attention towards
everybody which there was not here.

<p/>The only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly half
an hour was from a sudden burst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father's, not at all calculated
to compose them. At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooing
in the passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Devil take those young dogs! How they are
singing out! Ay, Sam's voice louder than all the rest! That boy is fit
for a boatswain. Holla, you there! Sam, stop your confounded pipe, or I
shall be after you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This threat was so palpably disregarded, that though within five minutes
afterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and sat down,
Fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than their
being for the time thoroughly fagged, which their hot faces and panting
breaths seemed to prove, especially as they were still kicking each
other's shins, and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately under
their father's eye.

<p/>The next opening of the door brought something more welcome: it was for
the tea-things, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had begun almost to despair of seeing that
evening. Susan and an attendant girl, whose inferior appearance informed
Fanny, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) great surprise, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had previously seen the upper
servant, brought in everything necessary for the meal; Susan looking, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) sister, as if divided
between the agreeable triumph of shewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) activity and usefulness,
and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an office. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had been into the kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to hurry Sally and help make the
toast, and spread the bread and butter, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) did not know when they
should have got tea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) sister must want something
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was very thankful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could not but own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) should be very
glad of a little tea, and Susan immediately set about making it, as if
pleased to have the employment all to herself; and with only a little
unnecessary bustle, and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
brothers in better order than she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could, acquitted herself very well.
Fanny's spirit was as much refreshed as her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) body; her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) head and heart
were soon the better for such well-timed kindness. Susan had an open,
sensible countenance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was like William, and Fanny hoped to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
like him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in disposition and goodwill towards herself.

<p/>In this more placid state of things William reentered, followed not
far behind by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother and Betsey. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), complete in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lieutenant's
uniform, looking and moving all the taller, firmer, and more graceful
for it, and with the happiest smile over his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face, walked up directly
to Fanny, who, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for a moment in
speechless admiration, and then threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) neck to sob out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) various emotions of pain and pleasure.

<p/>Anxious not to appear unhappy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) soon recovered herself; and wiping
away her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tears, was able to notice and admire all the striking parts
of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) dress; listening with reviving spirits to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cheerful hopes of
being on shore some part of every day before they sailed, and even of
getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to Spithead to see the sloop.

<p/>The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell, the surgeon of the Thrush, a
very well-behaved young man, who came to call for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) friend, and for
whom there was with some contrivance found a chair, and with some hasty
washing of the young tea-maker's, a cup and saucer; and after another
quarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen, noise rising
upon noise, and bustle upon bustle, men and boys at last all in motion
together, the moment came for setting off; everything was ready, William
took leave, and all of them were gone; for the three boys, in spite
of their mother's entreaty, determined to see their brother and Mr.
Campbell to the sally-port; and Mr. Price walked off at the same time to
carry back his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) neighbour's newspaper.

<p/>Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for; and accordingly,
when Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea-things,
and Mrs. Price had walked about the room some time looking for a
shirt-sleeve, which Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the
kitchen, the small party of females were pretty well composed, and the
mother having lamented again over the impossibility of getting Sam ready
in time, was at leisure to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eldest daughter and the friends
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had come from.

<p/>A few inquiries began: but one of the earliest--<div class="bookquote">``How did sister Bertram
manage about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) servants?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) as much plagued as herself to get
tolerable servants?'' (<font color='red'><b>Northamptonshire</b></font>)</div>--soon led her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind away from Northamptonshire, and
fixed it on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own domestic grievances, and the shocking character of
all the Portsmouth servants, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own two were the
very worst, engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) completely. The Bertrams were all forgotten
in detailing the faults of Rebecca, against whom Susan had also much
to depose, and little Betsey a great deal more, and who did seem so
thoroughly without a single recommendation, that Fanny could not help
modestly presuming that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother meant to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) year
was up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) year!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Price; <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) has staid a year, for that will not be up till November.
Servants are come to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it is
quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year. I have no hope
of ever being settled; and if I was to part with Rebecca, I should
only get something worse. And yet I do not think I am a very difficult
mistress to please; and I am sure the place is easy enough, for there is
always a girl under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and I often do half the work myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was silent; but not from being convinced that there might not be a
remedy found for some of these evils. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now sat looking at Betsey,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) could not but think particularly of another sister, a very pretty
little girl, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left there not much younger when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went into
Northamptonshire, who had died a few years afterwards. There had been
something remarkably amiable about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Fanny in those early days had
preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to Susan; and when the news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) death had at last
reached Mansfield, had for a short time been quite afflicted. The sight
of Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
not have pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother by alluding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for the world. While
considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with these ideas, Betsey, at a small distance, was
holding out something to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) eyes, meaning to screen it at the
same time from Susan's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you got there, my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny; <div class="bookquote">``come and shew it to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a silver knife. Up jumped Susan, claiming it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own, and
trying to get it away; but the child ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) mother's protection,
and Susan could only reproach, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) did very warmly, and evidently
hoping to interest Fanny on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">``It was very hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not
to have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) _own_ knife; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own knife; little sister Mary had
left it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) deathbed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought to have had it to keep
herself long ago. But mama kept it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and was always letting
Betsey get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey would
spoil it, and get it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) own, though mama had _promised_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) that
Betsey should not have it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) own hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was quite shocked. Every feeling of duty, honour, and tenderness
was wounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister's speech and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Price, in a complaining voice, <div class="bookquote">``now, how can
you be so cross? You are always quarrelling about that knife. I wish you
would not be so quarrelsome. Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is to
you! But you should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you to
the drawer. You know I told you not to touch it, because Susan is so
cross about it. I must hide it another time, Betsey. Poor Mary little
thought it would be such a bone of contention when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave it me to
keep, only two hours before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) died. Poor little soul! she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could but
just speak to be heard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said so prettily, `Let sister Susan have
my knife, mama, when I am dead and buried.' Poor little dear! she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was so
fond of it, Fanny, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have it lay by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in bed, all through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) illness. It was the gift of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good godmother, old Mrs. Admiral
Maxwell, only six weeks before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was taken for death. Poor little
sweet creature! Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was taken away from evil to come. My own
Betsey''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div>-LRB-fondling her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``_you_ have not the luck of such a good
godmother. Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people
as you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris, but a message to
say she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) hoped that her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) god-daughter was a good girl, and learnt her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
book. There had been at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing-room
at Mansfield Park about sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) a prayer-book; but no second sound
had been heard of such a purpose. Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home
and taken down two old prayer-books of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) husband with that idea; but,
upon examination, the ardour of generosity went off. One was found
to have too small a print for a child's eyes, and the other to be too
cumbersome for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to carry about.

<p/>Fanny, fatigued and fatigued again, was thankful to accept the first
invitation of going to bed; and before Betsey had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) cry at
being allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of sister,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) was off, leaving all below in confusion and noise again; the boys
begging for toasted cheese, her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) father calling out for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rum and
water, and Rebecca never where she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) ought to be.

<p/>There was nothing to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) spirits in the confined and scantily
furnished chamber that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) was to share with Susan. The smallness of
the rooms above and below, indeed, and the narrowness of the passage and
staircase, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) soon learned to think
with respect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own little attic at Mansfield Park, in _that_ house
reckoned too small for anybody's comfort.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX

<p/>Could Sir Thomas have seen all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece's feelings, when she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
first letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) aunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not have despaired; for though a good
night's rest, a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William again,
and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom and Charles
being gone to school, Sam on some project of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own, and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) father
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) usual lounges, enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to express herself cheerfully on the
subject of home, there were still, to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) own perfect consciousness,
many drawbacks suppressed. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) have seen only half that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) felt
before the end of a week, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and been delighted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own sagacity.

<p/>Before the week ended, it was all disappointment. In the first place,
William was gone. The Thrush had had her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) orders, the wind had changed,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth; and
during those days she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) only twice, in a short and
hurried way, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) had come ashore on duty. There had been no free
conversation, no walk on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, no
acquaintance with the Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned and
depended on. Everything in that quarter failed her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), except William's
affection. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) last thought on leaving home was for her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stepped back
again to the door to say, <div class="bookquote">``Take care of Fanny, mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is tender,
and not used to rough it like the rest of us. I charge you, take care of
Fanny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>William was gone: and the home he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) in was, Fanny could not
conceal it from herself, in almost every respect the very reverse of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have wished. It was the abode of noise, disorder, and
impropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it
ought to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hoped. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
father, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) confidence had not been sanguine, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was more negligent
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) family, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) habits were worse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manners coarser, than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been prepared for. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not want abilities but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had no
curiosity, and no information beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) profession; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) read only
the newspaper and the navy-list; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) talked only of the dockyard, the
harbour, Spithead, and the Motherbank; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) swore and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drank, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
dirty and gross. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never been able to recall anything approaching
to tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) former treatment of herself. There had remained
only a general impression of roughness and loudness; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) scarcely
ever noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), but to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the object of a coarse joke.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) disappointment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother was greater: _there_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hoped
much, and found almost nothing. Every flattering scheme of being of
consequence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) soon fell to the ground. Mrs. Price was not unkind;
but, instead of gaining on her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) affection and confidence, and becoming
more and more dear, her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughter never met with greater kindness from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) than on the first day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) arrival. The instinct of nature was
soon satisfied, and Mrs. Price's attachment had no other source. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
heart and her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) time were already quite full; she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had neither leisure nor
affection to bestow on Fanny. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) daughters never had been much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sons, especially of William, but Betsey was the
first of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) girls whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) had ever much regarded. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) was most
injudiciously indulgent. William was her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) pride; Betsey her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) darling;
and John, Richard, Sam, Tom, and Charles occupied all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>)
maternal solicitude, alternately her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) worries and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) comforts. These
shared her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) heart: her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) time was given chiefly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) house and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>)
servants. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) days were spent in a kind of slow bustle; all was busy
without getting on, always behindhand and lamenting it, without altering
her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) ways; wishing to be an economist, without contrivance or regularity;
dissatisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) servants, without skill to make them better, and
whether helping, or reprimanding, or indulging them, without any power
of engaging their respect.

<p/>Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram
than Mrs. Norris. She (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was a manager by necessity, without any of Mrs.
Norris's inclination for it, or any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) activity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) disposition
was naturally easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram's; and a situation of
similar affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more suited
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) capacity than the exertions and self-denials of the one which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
imprudent marriage had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) might have made just as good a
woman of consequence as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris would have been a
more respectable mother of nine children on a small income.

<p/>Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might scruple
to make use of the words, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must and did feel that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother was
a partial, ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taught
nor restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) children, whose house was the scene of mismanagement
and discomfort from beginning to end, and who had no talent, no
conversation, no affection towards herself; no curiosity to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
better, no desire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friendship, and no inclination for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) company
that could lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sense of such feelings.

<p/>Fanny was very anxious to be useful, and not to appear above her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home,
or in any way disqualified or disinclined, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) foreign education,
from contributing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) help to its comforts, and therefore set about
working for Sam immediately; and by working early and late, with
perseverance and great despatch, did so much that the boy was shipped
off at last, with more than half his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) linen ready. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had great pleasure
in feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) usefulness, but could not conceive how they would have
managed without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>Sam, loud and overbearing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rather regretted when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) went,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was clever and intelligent, and glad to be employed in any errand
in the town; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan, given as
they were, though very reasonable in themselves, with ill-timed and
powerless warmth, was beginning to be influenced by Fanny's services
and gentle persuasions; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found that the best of the three younger
ones was gone in him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>): Tom and Charles being at least as many years as
they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason, which
might suggest the expediency of making friends, and of endeavouring to
be less disagreeable. Their sister soon despaired of making the smallest
impression on _them_; they were quite untameable by any means of address
which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had spirits or time to attempt. Every afternoon brought a
return of their riotous games all over the house; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) very early
learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday's constant half-holiday.

<p/>Betsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the alphabet her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>)
greatest enemy, left to be with the servants at her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) pleasure, and
then encouraged to report any evil of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) was almost as ready to
despair of being able to love or assist; and of Susan's temper she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
had many doubts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) continual disagreements with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) rash
squabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at least
so distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no means
without provocation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feared the disposition that could push them to
such length must be far from amiable, and from affording any repose to
herself.

<p/>Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head, and
teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Edmund with moderated feelings. On the
contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could think of nothing but Mansfield, its beloved inmates,
its happy ways. Everything where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now was in full contrast to it. The
elegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps, above all, the
peace and tranquillity of Mansfield, were brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) remembrance
every hour of the day, by the prevalence of everything opposite to them
_here_.

<p/>The living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper delicate and
nervous like Fanny's, an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony
could have entirely atoned for. It was the greatest misery of all. At
Mansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice, no abrupt bursts,
no tread of violence, was ever heard; all proceeded in a regular course
of cheerful orderliness; everybody had their due importance; everybody's
feelings were consulted. If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting,
good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and as to the little
irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris, they were short, they
were trifling, they were as a drop of water to the ocean, compared with
the ceaseless tumult of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) present abode. Here everybody was noisy,
every voice was loud -LRB-excepting, perhaps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) mother's, which resembled
the soft monotony of Lady Bertram's, only worn into fretfulness-RRB-.
Whatever was wanted was hallooed for, and the servants hallooed out
their excuses from the kitchen. The doors were in constant banging, the
stairs were never at rest, nothing was done without a clatter, nobody
sat still, and nobody could command attention when they spoke.

<p/>In a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) before the end
of a week, Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson's celebrated
judgment as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield
Park might have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.



<p/>CHAPTER XL

<p/>Fanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now
at the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun; Mary's next
letter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
was not right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great
relief to herself. Here was another strange revolution of mind! She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
really glad to receive the letter when it did come. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) present exile
from good society, and distance from everything that had been wont to
interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), a letter from one belonging to the set where her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart
lived, written with affection, and some degree of elegance, was
thoroughly acceptable. The usual plea of increasing engagements was made
in excuse for not having written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) earlier; <div class="bookquote">``And now that I have
begun,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``my letter will not be worth your reading, for
there will be no little offering of love at the end, no three or four
lines _passionnees_ from the most devoted H. C. in the world, for
Henry is in Norfolk; business called him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to Everingham ten days ago, or
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) only pretended to call, for the sake of being travelling
at the same time that you were. But there he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is, and, by the bye, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
absence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister's in
writing, for there has been no `Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny?
Is not it time for you to write to Fanny?' to spur me on. At last, after
various attempts at meeting, I have seen your cousins, `dear Julia and
dearest Mrs. Rushworth'; they found me at home yesterday, and we were
glad to see each other again. We _seemed_ _very_ glad to see each other,
and I do really think we were a little. We had a vast deal to say. Shall
I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned? I did
not use to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) wanting in self-possession, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had not quite
enough for the demands of yesterday. Upon the whole, Julia was in the
best looks of the two, at least after you were spoken of. There was no
recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of `Fanny,' and
spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as a sister should. But Mrs. Rushworth's day of good looks
will come; we have cards for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) first party on the 28th. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
will be in beauty, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) will open one of the best houses in Wimpole
Street. I was in it two years ago, when it was Lady Lascelle's, and
prefer it to almost any I know in London, and certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will then
feel, to use a vulgar phrase, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has got her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) pennyworth for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
penny. Henry could not have afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) such a house. I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will
recollect it, and be satisfied, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) may, with moving the
queen of a palace, though the king may appear best in the background;
and as I have no desire to tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), I shall never _force_ your name
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will grow sober by degrees. From all that I hear
and guess, Baron Wildenheim's attentions to Julia continue, but I do not
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildenheim</b></font>) has any serious encouragement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) ought to do better.
A poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot imagine any liking in the
case, for take away his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildenheim</b></font>) rants, and the poor baron has nothing. What a
difference a vowel makes! If his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildenheim</b></font>) rents were but equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildenheim</b></font>) rants! Your
cousin Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by parish duties. There
may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted. I am unwilling
to fancy myself neglected for a _young_ one. Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny,
this is a long letter from London: write me a pretty one in reply to
gladden Henry's eyes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) comes back, and send me an account of all
the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was great food for meditation in this letter, and chiefly for
unpleasant meditation; and yet, with all the uneasiness it supplied, it
connected her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with the absent, it told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) of people and things about
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never felt so much curiosity as now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
have been glad to have been sure of such a letter every week. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
correspondence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt Bertram was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) only concern of higher
interest.

<p/>As for any society in Portsmouth, that could at all make amends for
deficiencies at home, there were none within the circle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father's
and mother's acquaintance to afford her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) the smallest satisfaction: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
saw nobody in whose favour she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could wish to overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own shyness
and reserve. The men appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) all coarse, the women all pert,
everybody underbred; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave as little contentment as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) received
from introductions either to old or new acquaintance. The young ladies
who approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at first with some respect, in consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
coming from a baronet's family, were soon offended by what they termed
<div class="bookquote">``airs'' (<font color='red'><b>baronet family</b></font>)</div>; for, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) neither played on the pianoforte nor wore fine
pelisses, they could, on farther observation, admit no right of
superiority.

<p/>The first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home,
the first which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) judgment could entirely approve, and which gave any
promise of durability, was in a better knowledge of Susan, and a hope of
being of service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>). Susan had always behaved pleasantly to herself,
but the determined character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) general manners had astonished
and alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), and it was at least a fortnight before she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) began to
understand a disposition so totally different from her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own. Susan saw
that much was wrong at home, and wanted to set it right. That a girl of
fourteen, acting only on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own unassisted reason, should err in the
method of reform, was not wonderful; and Fanny soon became more disposed
to admire the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguish
justly, than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led.
Susan was only acting on the same truths, and pursuing the same system,
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own judgment acknowledged, but which her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) more supine and
yielding temper would have shrunk from asserting. Susan tried to be
useful, where _she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)_ could only have gone away and cried; and that Susan
was useful she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could perceive; that things, bad as they were, would
have been worse but for such interposition, and that both her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) mother and
Betsey were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgence
and vulgarity.

<p/>In every argument with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) mother, Susan had in point of reason the
advantage, and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) off.
The blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had
never known. There was no gratitude for affection past or present to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) better bear with its excesses to the others.

<p/>All this became gradually evident, and gradually placed Susan before her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
sister as an object of mingled compassion and respect. That her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) manner
was wrong, however, at times very wrong, her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) measures often ill-chosen
and ill-timed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) looks and language very often indefensible, Fanny
could not cease to feel; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began to hope they might be rectified.
Susan, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) found, looked up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) and wished for her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) good opinion; and
new as anything like an office of authority was to Fanny, new as it
was to imagine herself capable of guiding or informing any one, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did
resolve to give occasional hints to Susan, and endeavour to exercise for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) advantage the juster notions of what was due to everybody, and what
would be wisest for herself, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own more favoured education had
fixed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) influence, or at least the consciousness and use of it, originated
in an act of kindness by Susan, which, after many hesitations of
delicacy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) at last worked herself up to. It had very early occurred
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) that a small sum of money might, perhaps, restore peace for
ever on the sore subject of the silver knife, canvassed as it now was
continually, and the riches which she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was in possession of herself,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) uncle having given her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) 10 pounds at parting, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) as able as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was
willing to be generous. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was so wholly unused to confer favours,
except on the very poor, so unpractised in removing evils, or bestowing
kindnesses among her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) equals, and so fearful of appearing to elevate
herself as a great lady at home, that it took some time to determine
that it would not be unbecoming in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to make such a present. It
was made, however, at last: a silver knife was bought for Betsey, and
accepted with great delight, its newness giving it every advantage
over the other that could be desired; Susan was established in the full
possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own, Betsey handsomely declaring that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) had got
one so much prettier herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) should never want _that_ again; and
no reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother, which Fanny
had almost feared to be impossible. The deed thoroughly answered: a
source of domestic altercation was entirely done away, and it was the
means of opening Susan's heart to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) something more to
love and be interested in. Susan shewed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had delicacy: pleased
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was to be mistress of property which she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had been struggling for
at least two years, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) yet feared that her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) sister's judgment had been
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), and that a reproof was designed her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) for having so struggled
as to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of the house.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) temper was open. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) fears, blamed herself for
having contended so warmly; and from that hour Fanny, understanding the
worth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) disposition and perceiving how fully she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was inclined to
seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good opinion and refer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) judgment, began to feel again the
blessing of affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to a
mind so much in need of help, and so much deserving it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gave advice,
advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding, and given so
mildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect temper, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had the happiness of observing its good effects not unfrequently.
More was not expected by one who, while seeing all the obligation and
expediency of submission and forbearance, saw also with sympathetic
acuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating to a girl like
Susan. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) greatest wonder on the subject soon became--not that Susan
should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience against her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
better knowledge--but that so much better knowledge, so many good
notions should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in the midst
of negligence and error, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) should have formed such proper opinions
of what ought to be; she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), who had had no cousin Edmund to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
thoughts or fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) principles.

<p/>The intimacy thus begun between them was a material advantage to
each. By sitting together upstairs, they avoided a great deal of the
disturbance of the house; Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think it
no misfortune to be quietly employed. They sat without a fire; but
that was a privation familiar even to Fanny, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) suffered the
less because reminded by it of the East room. It was the only point of
resemblance. In space, light, furniture, and prospect, there was
nothing alike in the two apartments; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) often heaved a sigh at the
remembrance of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) books and boxes, and various comforts there. By
degrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs, at
first only in working and talking, but after a few days, the remembrance
of the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny found it
impossible not to try for books again. There were none in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's
house; but wealth is luxurious and daring, and some of hers found its
way to a circulating library. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) became a subscriber; amazed at being
anything _in propria persona_, amazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own doings in every way, to
be a renter, a chuser of books! And to be having any one's improvement
in view in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) choice! But so it was. Susan had read nothing, and Fanny
longed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a share in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own first pleasures, and inspire a
taste for the biography and poetry which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) delighted in herself.

<p/>In this occupation she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped, moreover, to bury some of the
recollections of Mansfield, which were too apt to seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind if her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
fingers only were busy; and, especially at this time, hoped it might
be useful in diverting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London,
whither, on the authority of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt's last letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was
gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no doubt of what would ensue. The promised notification
was hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head. The postman's knock within the neighbourhood
was beginning to bring its daily terrors, and if reading could banish
the idea for even half an hour, it was something gained.



<p/>CHAPTER XLI

<p/>A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town, and Fanny had
heard nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). There were three different conclusions to be drawn
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) silence, between which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind was in fluctuation; each of
them at times being held the most probable. Either his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) going had been
again delayed, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss
Crawford alone, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was too happy for letter-writing!

<p/>One morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly four weeks
from Mansfield, a point which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never failed to think over and
calculate every day, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and Susan were preparing to remove, as
usual, upstairs, they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they
felt they could not avoid, from Rebecca's alertness in going to the
door, a duty which always interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) beyond any other.

<p/>It was a gentleman's voice; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning
pale about, when Mr. Crawford walked into the room.

<p/>Good sense, like hers, will always act when really called upon; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been able to name him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, and recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
remembrance of the name, as that of <div class="bookquote">``William's friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable
at such a moment. The consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being known there only as
William's friend was some support. Having introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), however, and
being all reseated, the terrors that occurred of what this visit might
lead to were overpowering, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fancied herself on the point of
fainting away.

<p/>While trying to keep herself alive, their visitor, who had at first
approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with as animated a countenance as ever, was wisely and
kindly keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) eyes away, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time to recover, while he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
devoted himself entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and attending
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with the utmost politeness and propriety, at the same time with
a degree of friendliness, of interest at least, which was making his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
manner perfect.

<p/>Mrs. Price's manners were also at their best. Warmed by the sight of
such a friend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) son, and regulated by the wish of appearing to
advantage before him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was overflowing with gratitude--artless,
maternal gratitude--which could not be unpleasing. Mr. Price was out,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) regretted very much. Fanny was just recovered enough to
feel that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ could not regret it; for to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) many other sources of
uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might scold herself for the weakness, but there was no
scolding it away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was ashamed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have been yet more
ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father than of all the rest.

<p/>They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire;
and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) commendation as even her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) heart could
wish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had never seen so agreeable a man in her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) life;
and was only astonished to find that, so great and so agreeable as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the
port-admiral, nor the commissioner, nor yet with the intention of going
over to the island, nor of seeing the dockyard. Nothing of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
had been used to think of as the proof of importance, or the employment
of wealth, had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>commissioner</b></font>) to Portsmouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>commissioner</b></font>) had reached it late the
night before, was come for a day or two, was staying at the Crown, had
accidentally met with a navy officer or two of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) acquaintance since
his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) arrival, but had no object of that kind in coming.

<p/>By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had given all this information, it was not unreasonable
to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
tolerably able to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) eye, and hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had spent half an hour
with his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) sister the evening before his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) leaving London; that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having spent
scarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) return from Norfolk,
before he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) set off again; that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin Edmund was in town, had been in
town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) understood, a few days; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) himself, but
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and was to dine,
as yesterday, with the Frasers.

<p/>Fanny listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned circumstance;
nay, it seemed a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) worn mind to be at any certainty; and the
words, <div class="bookquote">``then by this time it is all settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>passed internally, without
more evidence of emotion than a faint blush.

<p/>After talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
interest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at the expediency of
an early walk. <div class="bookquote">``It was a lovely morning, and at that season of the year
a fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody
not to delay their exercise'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and such hints producing nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) soon
proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
daughters to take their walk without loss of time. Now they came to an
understanding. Mrs. Price, it appeared, scarcely ever stirred out of
doors, except of a Sunday; she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) owned she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) could seldom, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) large
family, find time for a walk. <div class="bookquote">``Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) not, then, persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
daughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the pleasure
of attending them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying.
<div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place; they
did not often get out; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knew they had some errands in the town,
which they would be very glad to do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>And the consequence was, that
Fanny, strange as it was--strange, awkward, and distressing--found
herself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street
with Mr. Crawford.

<p/>It was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion; for they were
hardly in the High Street before they met her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father, whose
appearance was not the better from its being Saturday. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopt; and,
ungentlemanlike as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to Mr.
Crawford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford
must be struck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must be ashamed and disgusted altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must
soon give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) up, and cease to have the smallest inclination for the
match; and yet, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been so much wanting his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) affection to
be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the
complaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United
Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought
by a clever, agreeable man, than have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) driven away by the vulgarity
of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nearest relations.

<p/>Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) future father-in-law with any
idea of taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for a model in dress; but -LRB-as Fanny instantly, and to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) great relief, discerned-RRB- her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father was a very different man, a
very different Mr. Price in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) behaviour to this most highly respected
stranger, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own family at home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) manners
now, though not polished, were more than passable: they were grateful,
animated, manly; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) expressions were those of an attached father, and
a sensible man; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loud tones did very well in the open air, and there
was not a single oath to be heard. Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instinctive compliment
to the good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the consequence what it
might, Fanny's immediate feelings were infinitely soothed.

<p/>The conclusion of the two gentlemen's civilities was an offer of Mr.
Price's to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford,
desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much the
longer with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, if
the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow or
other ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they were
not at all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but for
Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without the
smallest consideration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) daughters' errands in the High Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
took care, however, that they should be allowed to go to the shops they
came out expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long, for Fanny
could so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for, that before
the gentlemen, as they stood at the door, could do more than begin upon
the last naval regulations, or settle the number of three-deckers now in
commission, their companions were ready to proceed.

<p/>They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once, and the walk
would have been conducted--according to Mr. Crawford's opinion--in a
singular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it,
as the two girls, he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) found, would have been left to follow, and keep up
with them or not, as they could, while they walked on together at their
own hasty pace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was able to introduce some improvement occasionally,
though by no means to the extent he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) wished; he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) absolutely would not walk
away from them; and at any crossing or any crowd, when Mr. Price was
only calling out, <div class="bookquote">``Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue, take care of
yourselves; keep a sharp lookout!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Price</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) would give them his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) particular
attendance.

<p/>Once fairly in the dockyard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) began to reckon upon some happy
intercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a brother
lounger of Mr. Price's, who was come to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) daily survey of how
things went on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion than
himself; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied
going about together, and discussing matters of equal and never-failing
interest, while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard,
or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to
look at. Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest. Crawford could not
have wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) more fatigued or more ready to sit down; but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could
have wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister away. A quick-looking girl of Susan's age was the
very worst third in the world: totally different from Lady Bertram, all
eyes and ears; and there was no introducing the main point before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) must content himself with being only generally agreeable, and letting
Susan have her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) share of entertainment, with the indulgence, now and
then, of a look or hint for the better-informed and conscious Fanny.
Norfolk was what he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had mostly to talk of: there he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had been some time,
and everything there was rising in importance from his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) present schemes.
Such a man could come from no place, no society, without importing
something to amuse; his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) journeys and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) acquaintance were all of use,
and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>). For Fanny, somewhat
more was related than the accidental agreeableness of the parties he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had
been in. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) approbation, the particular reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) going into
Norfolk at all, at this unusual time of year, was given. It had been
real business, relative to the renewal of a lease in which the welfare
of a large and--he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) believed--industrious family was at stake. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had
suspected his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) agent of some underhand dealing; of meaning to bias
him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) against the deserving; and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had determined to go himself, and
thoroughly investigate the merits of the case. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had gone, had done
even more good than he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had foreseen, had been useful to more than his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
first plan had comprehended, and was now able to congratulate himself
upon it, and to feel that in performing a duty, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had secured agreeable
recollections for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had introduced himself to some
tenants whom he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had never seen before; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had begun making acquaintance
with cottages whose very existence, though on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own estate, had been
hitherto unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). This was aimed, and well aimed, at Fanny. It
was pleasing to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) speak so properly; here he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had been acting as
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) ought to do. To be the friend of the poor and the oppressed! Nothing
could be more grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was on the point of giving him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) an
approving look, when it was all frightened off by his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) adding a something
too pointed of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hoping soon to have an assistant, a friend, a guide
in every plan of utility or charity for Everingham: a somebody that
would make Everingham and all about it a dearer object than it had ever
been yet.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) turned away, and wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) would not say such things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
willing to allow he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) might have more good qualities than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been
wont to suppose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began to feel the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) turning out
well at last; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) was and must ever be completely unsuited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
and ought not to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) perceived that enough had been said of Everingham, and that it would
be as well to talk of something else, and turned to Mansfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) could
not have chosen better; that was a topic to bring back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attention and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looks almost instantly. It was a real indulgence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to hear or
to speak of Mansfield. Now so long divided from everybody who knew the
place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it quite the voice of a friend when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mentioned it,
and led the way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and
comforts, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own heart in the warmest eulogium, in speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
uncle as all that was clever and good, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt as having the
sweetest of all sweet tempers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had a great attachment to Mansfield himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) said so; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) looked
forward with the hope of spending much, very much, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) time there;
always there, or in the neighbourhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) particularly built upon a very
happy summer and autumn there this year; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) felt that it would be so: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)
depended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the last.
As animated, as diversified, as social, but with circumstances of
superiority undescribable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mansfield, Sotherton, Thornton Lacey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``what a society
will be comprised in those houses! And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourth
may be added: some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything so
dear; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund Bertram
once good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee two objections: two
fair, excellent, irresistible objections to that plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny was doubly silenced here; though when the moment was passed,
could regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not forced herself into the acknowledged
comprehension of one half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) meaning, and encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) to say
something more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) sister and Edmund. It was a subject which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must
learn to speak of, and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon be
quite unpardonable.

<p/>When Mr. Price and his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) friend had seen all that they wished, or had time
for, the others were ready to return; and in the course of their walk
back, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute's privacy for telling Fanny that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only business in Portsmouth was to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was come down
for a couple of days on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) account, and hers only, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could
not endure a longer total separation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was sorry, really sorry; and
yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had not said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) altogether improved since she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was much more gentle, obliging, and attentive to other people's
feelings than he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had ever been at Mansfield; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) so
agreeable--so _near_ being agreeable; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father could
not offend, and there was something particularly kind and proper in the
notice he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) took of Susan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was decidedly improved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) wished the next
day over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had come only for one day; but it was not
so very bad as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) would have expected: the pleasure of talking of
Mansfield was so very great!

<p/>Before they parted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) for another pleasure, and one
of no trivial kind. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to do them the honour of taking
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mutton with them, and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror,
before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) declared himself prevented by a prior engagement. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
engaged to dinner already both for that day and the next; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had met
with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should
have the honour, however, of waiting on them again on the morrow, etc.,
and so they parted--Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping so
horrible an evil!

<p/>To have had him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) join their family dinner-party, and see all their
deficiencies, would have been dreadful! Rebecca's cookery and Rebecca's
waiting, and Betsey's eating at table without restraint, and pulling
everything about as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) chose, were what Fanny herself was not yet
enough inured to for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) often to make a tolerable meal. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ was nice
only from natural delicacy, but _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ had been brought up in a school of
luxury and epicurism.



<p/>CHAPTER XLII

<p/>The Prices were just setting off for church the next day when Mr.
Crawford appeared again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) came, not to stop, but to join them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
asked to go with them to the Garrison chapel, which was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Garrison</b></font>)
had intended, and they all walked thither together.

<p/>The family were now seen to advantage. Nature had given them no
inconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday dressed them in their
cleanest skins and best attire. Sunday always brought this comfort to
Fanny, and on this Sunday she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it more than ever. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor mother
now did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram's sister as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
was but too apt to look. It often grieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to the heart to think of
the contrast between them; to think that where nature had made so little
difference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) mother,
as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) junior, should have an
appearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so slatternly,
so shabby. But Sunday made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) a very creditable and tolerably
cheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family of
children, feeling a little respite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) weekly cares, and only
discomposed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by with
a flower in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) hat.

<p/>In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford took care not to
be divided from the female branch; and after chapel he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) still continued
with them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts.

<p/>Mrs. Price took her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday
throughout the year, always going directly after morning service and
staying till dinner-time. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) public place: there she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
acquaintance, heard a little news, talked over the badness of the
Portsmouth servants, and wound up her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) spirits for the six days ensuing.

<p/>Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss
Prices as his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) peculiar charge; and before they had been there long,
somehow or other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have believed
it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was walking between them with an arm of each under his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not know how to prevent or put an end to it. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
uncomfortable for a time, but yet there were enjoyments in the day and
in the view which would be felt.

<p/>The day was uncommonly lovely. It was really March; but it was April in
its mild air, brisk soft wind, and bright sun, occasionally clouded for
a minute; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of such
a sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships at
Spithead and the island beyond, with the ever-varying hues of the sea,
now at high water, dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts
with so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination of charms
for Fanny, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gradually almost careless of the circumstances
under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt them. Nay, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) been without his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would
soon have known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) needed it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted strength for a two
hours' saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally did, upon a week's
previous inactivity. Fanny was beginning to feel the effect of being
debarred from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) usual regular exercise; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had lost ground as to
health since her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr. Crawford and the
beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up now.

<p/>The loveliness of the day, and of the view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt like herself. They
often stopt with the same sentiment and taste, leaning against the wall,
some minutes, to look and admire; and considering he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was not Edmund,
Fanny could not but allow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was sufficiently open to the charms
of nature, and very well able to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) admiration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had a few
tender reveries now and then, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could sometimes take advantage
of to look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face without detection; and the result of these looks
was, that though as bewitching as ever, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face was less blooming than
it ought to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _said_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was very well, and did not like to be
supposed otherwise; but take it all in all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
present residence could not be comfortable, and therefore could not
be salutary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was growing anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being again at
Mansfield, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own happiness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), must be so
much greater.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been here a month, I think?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not quite a month. It is only four weeks to-morrow since I left
Mansfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a most accurate and honest reckoner. I should call that a
month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it is to be a two months' visit, is not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. My uncle talked of two months. I suppose it will not be less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how are you to be conveyed back again? Who comes for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt. Perhaps
I may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for me to be fetched
exactly at the two months' end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment's reflection, Mr. Crawford replied, <div class="bookquote">``I know Mansfield, I
know its way, I know its faults towards _you_. I know the danger of
your being so far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the
imaginary convenience of any single being in the family. I am aware
that you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas cannot settle
everything for coming himself, or sending your aunt's maid for you,
without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
may have laid down for the next quarter of a year. This will not do. Two
months is an ample allowance; I should think six weeks quite enough.
I am considering your sister's health,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), addressing himself to
Susan, <div class="bookquote">``which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
requires constant air and exercise. When you know her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as well as I do,
I am sure you will agree that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) does, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ought never to
be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country. If,
therefore''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning again to Fanny-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``you find yourself growing unwell,
and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield, without
waiting for the two months to be ended, _that_ must not be regarded
as of any consequence, if you feel yourself at all less strong or
comfortable than usual, and will only let my sister know it, give her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
only the slightest hint, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and I will immediately come down, and take
you back to Mansfield. You know the ease and the pleasure with which
this would be done. You know all that would be felt on the occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), but tried to laugh it off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``as you perfectly know. And I
hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition.
Indeed, you shall _not_; it shall not be in your power; for so long only
as you positively say, in every letter to Mary, `I am well,' and I
know you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long only shall you be
considered as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again, but was affected and distressed to a degree
that made it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to say much, or even to be certain of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to say. This was towards the close of their walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
attended them to the last, and left them only at the door of their own
house, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) knew them to be going to dinner, and therefore pretended
to be waited for elsewhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you were not so tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), still detaining Fanny after all
the others were in the house--<div class="bookquote">``I wish I left you in stronger health. Is
there anything I can do for you in town? I have half an idea of going
into Norfolk again soon. I am not satisfied about Maddison. I am sure
he (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>) still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>) own
into a certain mill, which I design for somebody else. I must come to an
understanding with him (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>). I must make him (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>) know that I will not be tricked
on the south side of Everingham, any more than on the north: that I will
be master of my own property. I was not explicit enough with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) before.
The mischief such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
employer and the welfare of the poor, is inconceivable. I have a great
mind to go back into Norfolk directly, and put everything at once on
such a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from. Maddison is a
clever fellow; I do not wish to displace him (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>), provided he (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>) does not try
to displace _me_; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no
right of creditor to dupe me, and worse than simple to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) give me a
hard-hearted, griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man,
to whom I have given half a promise already. Would it not be worse than
simple? Shall I go? Do you advise it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I advise! You know very well what is right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. When you give me your opinion, I always know what is right. Your
judgment is my rule of right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! do not say so. We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we
would attend to it, than any other person can be. Good-bye; I wish you a
pleasant journey to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there nothing I can do for you in town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing; I am much obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you no message for anybody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my
cousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I
shall soon hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is lazy or negligent, I will write his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) excuses
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and was gone. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ went to while away the next
three hours as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) other acquaintance, till the best
dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment, and
_she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ turned in to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) more simple one immediately.

<p/>Their general fare bore a very different character; and could he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) have
suspected how many privations, besides that of exercise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) endured in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's house, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have wondered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looks were not much
more affected than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was so little equal to Rebecca's
puddings and Rebecca's hashes, brought to table, as they all were, with
such accompaniments of half-cleaned plates, and not half-cleaned knives
and forks, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) was very often constrained to defer her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) heartiest
meal till she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) could send her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) brothers in the evening for biscuits and
buns. After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the day
to be hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) known all,
might have thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece in the most promising way of being starved,
both mind and body, into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford's good
company and good fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would probably have feared to push his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
experiment farther, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) might die under the cure.

<p/>Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day. Though tolerably
secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not help being low.
It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend; and though, in
one light, glad to have him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gone, it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was now deserted
by everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not think of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) returning to town, and being frequently with
Mary and Edmund, without feelings so near akin to envy as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hate
herself for having them.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); a
friend or two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father's, as always happened if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not with
them, spent the long, long evening there; and from six o’clock till
half-past nine, there was little intermission of noise or grog. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
was very low. The wonderful improvement which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) still fancied in Mr.
Crawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within the
current of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thoughts. Not considering in how different a circle she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had been just seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), nor how much might be owing to contrast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
was quite persuaded of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being astonishingly more gentle and regardful
of others than formerly. And, if in little things, must it not be so in
great? So anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) health and comfort, so very feeling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) now
expressed himself, and really seemed, might not it be fairly supposed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?



<p/>CHAPTER XLIII

<p/>It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back, to London, on the
morrow, for nothing more was seen of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at Mr. Price's; and two days
afterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sister, opened and read by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), on another account, with the
most anxious curiosity:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry has been down to
Portsmouth to see you; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had a delightful walk with you to the
dockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the next day,
on the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweet
looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony,
and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.
This, as well as I understand, is to be the substance of my information.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be communicated,
except this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said walks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
introduction to your family, especially to a fair sister of yours, a
fine girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
first lesson, I presume, in love. I have not time for writing much, but
it would be out of place if I had, for this is to be a mere letter of
business, penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information,
which could not be delayed without risk of evil. My dear, dear Fanny,
if I had you here, how I would talk to you! You should listen to me till
you were tired, and advise me till you were still tired more; but it is
impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper, so I will
abstain altogether, and leave you to guess what you like. I have no news
for you. You have politics, of course; and it would be too bad to plague
you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time. I ought
to have sent you an account of your cousin's first party, but I was
lazy, and now it is too long ago; suffice it, that everything was just
as it ought to be, in a style that any of her (<font color='blue'><b>parties</b></font>) connexions must have been
gratified to witness, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>parties</b></font>) own dress and manners did her (<font color='blue'><b>parties</b></font>) the
greatest credit. My friend, Mrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and it
would not make _me_ miserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Stornaway</b></font>) seems in high spirits, and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is very
good-humoured and pleasant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own family, and I do not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) so
very ill-looking as I did--at least, one sees many worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will not
do by the side of your cousin Edmund. Of the last-mentioned hero, what
shall I say? If I avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) name entirely, it would look suspicious.
I will say, then, that we have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) two or three times, and that
my friends here are very much struck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gentlemanlike appearance.
Mrs. Fraser -LRB-no bad judge-RRB- declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) knows but three men in town
who have so good a person, height, and air; and I must confess, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
dined here the other day, there were none to compare with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and
we were a party of sixteen. Luckily there is no distinction of dress
nowadays to tell tales, but--but--but Yours affectionately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had almost forgot -LRB-it was Edmund's fault: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gets into my head more
than does me good-RRB- one very material thing I had to say from Henry and
myself--I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire. My dear
little creature, do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks.
Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health. My poor aunt
always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral
of course never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service
and Henry's, at an hour's notice. I should like the scheme, and we would
make a little circuit, and shew you Everingham in our way, and perhaps
you would not mind passing through London, and seeing the inside of St.
George's, Hanover Square. Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such
a time: I should not like to be tempted. What a long letter! one word
more. Henry, I find, has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon
some business that _you_ approve; but this cannot possibly be permitted
before the middle of next week; that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cannot anyhow be spared till
after the 14th, for _we_ have a party that evening. The value of a man
like Henry, on such an occasion, is what you can have no conception
of; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will see the
Rushworths, which own I am not sorry for--having a little curiosity, and
so I think has he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will not acknowledge it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be read deliberately,
to supply matter for much reflection, and to leave everything in greater
suspense than ever. The only certainty to be drawn from it was, that
nothing decisive had yet taken place. Edmund had not yet spoken. How
Miss Crawford really felt, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meant to act, or might act without
or against her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meaning; whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) were quite what
it had been before the last separation; whether, if lessened, it were
likely to lessen more, or to recover itself, were subjects for endless
conjecture, and to be thought of on that day and many days to come,
without producing any conclusion. The idea that returned the oftenest
was that Miss Crawford, after proving herself cooled and staggered by
a return to London habits, would yet prove herself in the end too much
attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would try to be more ambitious than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart would allow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would hesitate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would tease, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would
condition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would require a great deal, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would finally accept.

<p/>This was Fanny's most frequent expectation. A house in town--that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
thought, must be impossible. Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford
might not ask. The prospect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cousin grew worse and worse. The
woman who could speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and speak only of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) appearance! What an
unworthy attachment! To be deriving support from the commendations of
Mrs. Fraser! _She (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)_ who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) intimately half a year! Fanny was
ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr.
Crawford and herself, touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in comparison, slightly. Whether Mr.
Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no
concern of hers, though, everything considered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) _would_
go without delay. That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a
meeting between him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) worst line of
conduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped _he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ would
not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) acknowledged no such
inducement, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister ought to have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) credit for better
feelings than her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving
this than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been before; and for a few days was so unsettled by
it altogether, by what had come, and what might come, that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) usual
readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could
not command her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) attention as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wished. If Mr. Crawford remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
message to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) thought it very likely, most likely, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
would write to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) at all events; it would be most consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
usual kindness; and till she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) got rid of this idea, till it gradually
wore off, by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days
more, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was in a most restless, anxious state.

<p/>At length, a something like composure succeeded. Suspense must be
submitted to, and must not be allowed to wear her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) out, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
useless. Time did something, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own exertions something more, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same interest in
them.

<p/>Susan was growing very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), and though without any of the early
delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny, with a disposition
much less inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for
information's sake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had so strong a desire of not _appearing_
ignorant, as, with a good clear understanding, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a most
attentive, profitable, thankful pupil. Fanny was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) oracle. Fanny's
explanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay,
or every chapter of history. What Fanny told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) of former times dwelt
more on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister
the compliment of preferring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) style to that of any printed author.
The early habit of reading was wanting.

<p/>Their conversations, however, were not always on subjects so high as
history or morals. Others had their hour; and of lesser matters, none
returned so often, or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park,
a description of the people, the manners, the amusements, the ways
of Mansfield Park. Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel and
well-appointed, was eager to hear, and Fanny could not but indulge
herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped it was not wrong;
though, after a time, Susan's very great admiration of everything
said or done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) uncle's house, and earnest longing to go into
Northamptonshire, seemed almost to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) for exciting feelings which
could not be gratified.

<p/>Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) elder sister;
and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began to feel that
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own release from Portsmouth came, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness would have a
material drawback in leaving Susan behind. That a girl so capable of
being made everything good should be left in such hands, distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
more and more. Were _she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)_ likely to have a home to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) to, what
a blessing it would be! And had it been possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) to return Mr.
Crawford's regard, the probability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being very far from objecting
to such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own
comforts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was really good-tempered, and could fancy his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly.



<p/>CHAPTER XLIV

<p/>Seven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone, when the one
letter, the letter from Edmund, so long expected, was put into Fanny's
hands. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) opened, and saw its length, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) prepared herself for a
minute detail of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards
the fortunate creature who was now mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) fate. These were the
contents--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Dear Fanny,--Excuse me that I have not written before. Crawford told
me that you were wishing to hear from me, but I found it impossible to
write from London, and persuaded myself that you would understand my
silence. Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not have been
wanting, but nothing of that nature was ever in my power. I am returned
to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it. My hopes are
much weaker. You are probably aware of this already. So very fond of you
as Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should tell you enough
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine. I will not be
prevented, however, from making my own communication. Our confidences in
you need not clash. I ask no questions. There is something soothing
in the idea that we have the same friend, and that whatever unhappy
differences of opinion may exist between us, we are united in our love
of you. It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are, and
what are my present plans, if plans I can be said to have. I have been
returned since Saturday. I was three weeks in London, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) -LRB-for
London-RRB- very often. I had every attention from the Frasers that could be
reasonably expected. I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with
me hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
manner, however, rather than any unfrequency of meeting. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) been
different when I did see her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), I should have made no complaint, but from
the very first she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was altered: my first reception was so unlike what I
had hoped, that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly.
I need not particularise. You know the weak side of her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) character, and
may imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
was in high spirits, and surrounded by those who were giving all the
support of their own bad sense to her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) too lively mind. I do not like
Mrs. Fraser. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) is a cold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirely
from convenience, and though evidently unhappy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) marriage,
places her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) disappointment not to faults of judgment, or temper, or
disproportion of age, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) being, after all, less affluent than
many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) acquaintance, especially than her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) sister, Lady Stornaway,
and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious,
provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough. I look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)
intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) life
and mine. They have been leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) astray for years. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) be
detached from them!--and sometimes I do not despair of it, for the
affection appears to me principally on their side. They are very fond of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>); but I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) does not love them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) loves you. When I think
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) great attachment to you, indeed, and the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) judicious,
upright conduct as a sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) appears a very different creature,
capable of everything noble, and I am ready to blame myself for a too
harsh construction of a playful manner. I cannot give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) up, Fanny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)
is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife. If
I did not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had some regard for me, of course I should
not say this, but I do believe it. I am convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is not
without a decided preference. I have no jealousy of any individual. It
is the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous
of. It is the habits of wealth that I fear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ideas are not higher
than her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own fortune may warrant, but they are beyond what our incomes
united could authorise. There is comfort, however, even here. I could
better bear to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) because not rich enough, than because of my
profession. That would only prove her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) affection not equal to sacrifices,
which, in fact, I am scarcely justified in asking; and, if I am refused,
that, I think, will be the honest motive. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) prejudices, I trust, are
not so strong as they were. You have my thoughts exactly as they arise,
my dear Fanny; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory, but it will
not be a less faithful picture of my mind. Having once begun, it is a
pleasure to me to tell you all I feel. I cannot give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) up. Connected
as we already are, and, I hope, are to be, to give up Mary Crawford
would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me; to
banish myself from the very houses and friends whom, under any other
distress, I should turn to for consolation. The loss of Mary I must
consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny. Were it a
decided thing, an actual refusal, I hope I should know how to bear it,
and how to endeavour to weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hold on my heart, and in the course
of a few years--but I am writing nonsense. Were I refused, I must bear
it; and till I am, I can never cease to try for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). This is the truth.
The only question is _how_? What may be the likeliest means? I have
sometimes thought of going to London again after Easter, and sometimes
resolved on doing nothing till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) returns to Mansfield. Even now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June; but June is at
a great distance, and I believe I shall write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). I have nearly
determined on explaining myself by letter. To be at an early certainty
is a material object. My present state is miserably irksome. Considering
everything, I think a letter will be decidedly the best method of
explanation. I shall be able to write much that I could not say, and
shall be giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time for reflection before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) resolves on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
answer, and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an
immediate hasty impulse; I think I am. My greatest danger would lie in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) consulting Mrs. Fraser, and I at a distance unable to help my own
cause. A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation, and where
the mind is anything short of perfect decision, an adviser may, in an
unlucky moment, lead it to do what it may afterwards regret. I must
think this matter over a little. This long letter, full of my own
concerns alone, will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny.
The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser's party. I am more
and more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>). There is not a
shadow of wavering. He (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) thoroughly knows his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) own mind, and acts up to his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>)
resolutions: an inestimable quality. I could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) and my eldest
sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me,
and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends. There was
marked coolness on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) side. They scarcely spoke. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) draw back
surprised, and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former
supposed slight to Miss Bertram. You will wish to hear my opinion
of Maria's degree of comfort as a wife. There is no appearance of
unhappiness. I hope they get on pretty well together. I dined twice in
Wimpole Street, and might have been there oftener, but it is mortifying
to be with Rushworth as a brother. Julia seems to enjoy London
exceedingly. I had little enjoyment there, but have less here. We are
not a lively party. You are very much wanted. I miss you more than I
can express. My mother desires her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) best love, and hopes to hear from
you soon. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) talks of you almost every hour, and I am sorry to find
how many weeks more she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is likely to be without you. My father means
to fetch you himself, but it will not be till after Easter, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has
business in town. You are happy at Portsmouth, I hope, but this must
not be a yearly visit. I want you at home, that I may have your opinion
about Thornton Lacey. I have little heart for extensive improvements
till I know that it will ever have a mistress. I think I shall certainly
write. It is quite settled that the Grants go to Bath; they leave
Mansfield on Monday. I am glad of it. I am not comfortable enough to be
fit for anybody; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an
article of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.--Yours
ever, my dearest Fanny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a letter again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>was
Fanny's secret declaration as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) finished this. <div class="bookquote">``What do they bring but
disappointment and sorrow? Not till after Easter! How shall I bear it?
And my poor aunt talking of me every hour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was
quite unkind, both to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt and to herself. As for the main subject
of the letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
almost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund. <div class="bookquote">``There is no
good in this delay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why is not it settled? He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is blinded,
and nothing will open his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) eyes; nothing can, after having had truths
before him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) so long in vain. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and be poor and
miserable. God grant that her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) influence do not make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cease to be
respectable!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked over the letter again. ```So very fond of me!'
`tis nonsense all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) loves nobody but herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
friends leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) astray for years! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is quite as likely to have led
_them_ astray. They have all, perhaps, been corrupting one another; but
if they are so much fonder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is the less
likely to have been hurt, except by their flattery. `The only woman in
the world whom he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could ever think of as a wife.' I firmly believe it.
It is an attachment to govern his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) whole life. Accepted or refused, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
heart is wedded to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for ever. `The loss of Mary I must consider as
comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.' Edmund, you do not know
me. The families would never be connected if you did not connect
them! Oh! write, write. Finish it at once. Let there be an end of this
suspense. Fix, commit, condemn yourself.''

<p/>Such sensations, however, were too near akin to resentment to be long
guiding Fanny's soliloquies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon more softened and sorrowful.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) warm regard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) kind expressions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) confidential treatment,
touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) strongly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was only too good to everybody. It was a
letter, in short, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not but have had for the world, and
which could never be valued enough. This was the end of it.

<p/>Everybody at all addicted to letter-writing, without having much to say,
which will include a large proportion of the female world at least, must
feel with Lady Bertram that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was out of luck in having such a capital
piece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath,
occur at a time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could make no advantage of it, and will admit
that it must have been very mortifying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to see it fall to the
share of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) thankless son, and treated as concisely as possible at the
end of a long letter, instead of having it to spread over the largest
part of a page of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own. For though Lady Bertram rather shone in the
epistolary line, having early in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) marriage, from the want of other
employment, and the circumstance of Sir Thomas's being in Parliament,
got into the way of making and keeping correspondents, and formed for
herself a very creditable, common-place, amplifying style, so that a
very little matter was enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could not do entirely without
any; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) must have something to write about, even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) niece; and
being so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant's gouty symptoms and
Mrs. Grant's morning calls, it was very hard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to be deprived of
one of the last epistolary uses she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could put them to.

<p/>There was a rich amends, however, preparing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). Lady Bertram's
hour of good luck came. Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund's
letter, Fanny had one from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, beginning thus--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Dear Fanny,--I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming
intelligence, which I make no doubt will give you much concern'' (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquaint
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with all the particulars of the Grants' intended journey, for the
present intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the pen
for many days to come, being no less than the dangerous illness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
eldest son, of which they had received notice by express a few hours
before.

<p/>Tom had gone from London with a party of young men to Newmarket, where
a neglected fall and a good deal of drinking had brought on a fever; and
when the party broke up, being unable to move, had been left by himself
at the house of one of these young men to the comforts of sickness and
solitude, and the attendance only of servants. Instead of being soon
well enough to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friends, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had then hoped, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) disorder
increased considerably, and it was not long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought so ill of
himself as to be as ready as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) physician to have a letter despatched
to Mansfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>observed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ladyship, after giving the substance of it, <div class="bookquote">``has agitated us
exceedingly, and we cannot prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed
and apprehensive for the poor invalid, whose state Sir Thomas fears
may be very critical; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother
immediately, but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on
this distressing occasion, as it would be too trying for me. We shall
greatly miss Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be
apprehended, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) will be able to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to Mansfield shortly,
which Sir Thomas proposes should be done, and thinks best on every
account, and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to
bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury. As I
have little doubt of your feeling for us, my dear Fanny, under these
distressing circumstances, I will write again very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny's feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably more warm and
genuine than her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aunt's style of writing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt truly for them all.
Tom dangerously ill, Edmund gone to attend him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and the sadly small
party remaining at Mansfield, were cares to shut out every other care,
or almost every other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could just find selfishness enough to wonder
whether Edmund _had_ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came,
but no sentiment dwelt long with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that was not purely affectionate
and disinterestedly anxious. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) aunt did not neglect her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wrote
again and again; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund,
and these accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny, in the same
diffuse style, and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears, all
following and producing each other at haphazard. It was a sort of
playing at being frightened. The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not
see had little power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) fancy; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) wrote very comfortably
about agitation, and anxiety, and poor invalids, till Tom was actually
conveyed to Mansfield, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own eyes had beheld his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) altered
appearance. Then a letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had been previously preparing for
Fanny was finished in a different style, in the language of real feeling
and alarm; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wrote as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have spoken. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) is just come, my
dear Fanny, and is taken upstairs; and I am so shocked to see him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>), that
I do not know what to do. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) has been very ill. Poor Tom! I am
quite grieved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and very much frightened, and so is Sir Thomas;
and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me. But Sir
Thomas hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) will be better to-morrow, and says we must consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not
soon over. Tom's extreme impatience to be removed to Mansfield, and
experience those comforts of home and family which had been little
thought of in uninterrupted health, had probably induced his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) being
conveyed thither too early, as a return of fever came on, and for a week
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was in a more alarming state than ever. They were all very seriously
frightened. Lady Bertram wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) daily terrors to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) niece, who
might now be said to live upon letters, and pass all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) time between
suffering from that of to-day and looking forward to to-morrow's.
Without any particular affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) eldest cousin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) tenderness
of heart made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could not spare him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and the purity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) principles added yet a keener solicitude, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) considered how
little useful, how little self-denying his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) life had -LRB-apparently-RRB- been.

<p/>Susan was her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) only companion and listener on this, as on more common
occasions. Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise. Nobody else
could be interested in so remote an evil as illness in a family above an
hundred miles off; not even Mrs. Price, beyond a brief question or two,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughter with a letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) hand, and now and then the
quiet observation of, <div class="bookquote">``My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of
trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>So long divided and so differently situated, the ties of blood were
little more than nothing. An attachment, originally as tranquil as their
tempers, was now become a mere name. Mrs. Price did quite as much for
Lady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price. Three or
four Prices might have been swept away, any or all except Fanny and
William, and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it; or perhaps
might have caught from Mrs. Norris's lips the cant of its being a very
happy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price to have
them so well provided for.



<p/>CHAPTER XLV

<p/>At about the week's end from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) return to Mansfield, Tom's immediate
danger was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was so far pronounced safe as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother
perfectly easy; for being now used to the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) suffering,
helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never thinking beyond
what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard, with no disposition for alarm and no aptitude at a hint,
Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world for a little medical
imposition. The fever was subdued; the fever had been his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) complaint;
of course he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would soon be well again. Lady Bertram could think nothing
less, and Fanny shared her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) aunt's security, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) received a few
lines from Edmund, written purposely to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) a clearer idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
brother's situation, and acquaint her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) with the apprehensions which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some
strong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the frame on the departure
of the fever. They judged it best that Lady Bertram should not be
harassed by alarms which, it was to be hoped, would prove unfounded;
but there was no reason why Fanny should not know the truth. They were
apprehensive for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) lungs.

<p/>A very few lines from Edmund shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the patient and the sickroom
in a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram's sheets of paper
could do. There was hardly any one in the house who might not have
described, from personal observation, better than herself; not one who
was not more useful at times to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could do nothing but glide
in quietly and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but when able to talk or be talked to, or
read to, Edmund was the companion he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) preferred. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) aunt worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) by
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) conversation or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) voice to the level of irritation and feebleness. Edmund was all in
all. Fanny would certainly believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) so at least, and must find that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) estimation of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was higher than ever when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) appeared as the
attendant, supporter, cheerer of a suffering brother. There was not only
the debility of recent illness to assist: there was also, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now
learnt, nerves much affected, spirits much depressed to calm and raise,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly
guided.

<p/>The family were not consumptive, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was more inclined to hope than
fear for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin, except when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought of Miss Crawford; but Miss
Crawford gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the idea of being the child of good luck, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only
son.

<p/>Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten. Edmund's
letter had this postscript. <div class="bookquote">``On the subject of my last, I had actually
begun a letter when called away by Tom's illness, but I have now changed
my mind, and fear to trust the influence of friends. When Tom is better,
I shall go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Such was the state of Mansfield, and so it continued, with scarcely any
change, till Easter. A line occasionally added by Edmund to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mother's letter was enough for Fanny's information. Tom's amendment was
alarmingly slow.

<p/>Easter came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most sorrowfully
considered, on first learning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no chance of leaving
Portsmouth till after it. It came, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had yet heard nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
return--nothing even of the going to London, which was to precede
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) return. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt often expressed a wish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), but there was no
notice, no message from the uncle on whom all depended. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) supposed
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) could not yet leave his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) son, but it was a cruel, a terrible delay
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). The end of April was coming on; it would soon be almost three
months, instead of two, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been absent from them all, and that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) days had been passing in a state of penance, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) loved them
too well to hope they would thoroughly understand; and who could yet say
when there might be leisure to think of or fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)?

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eagerness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) impatience, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) longings to be with them, were such
as to bring a line or two of Cowper's Tirocinium for ever before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``With what intense desire she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wants her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was continually on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
tongue, as the truest description of a yearning which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not
suppose any schoolboy's bosom to feel more keenly.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been coming to Portsmouth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had loved to call it her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
home, had been fond of saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was going home; the word had
been very dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and so it still was, but it must be applied to
Mansfield. _That_ was now the home. Portsmouth was Portsmouth; Mansfield
was home. They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) secret
meditations, and nothing was more consolatory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
aunt using the same language: <div class="bookquote">``I cannot but say I much regret your being
from home at this distressing time, so very trying to my spirits. I
trust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so
long again,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>were most delightful sentences to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Still, however, it
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) private regale. Delicacy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) careful not to
betray such a preference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle's house. It was always: <div class="bookquote">``When I go
back into Northamptonshire, or when I return to Mansfield, I shall do
so and so.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For a great while it was so, but at last the longing grew
stronger, it overthrew caution, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found herself talking of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should do when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went home before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was aware. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reproached
herself, coloured, and looked fearfully towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father and mother.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) need not have been uneasy. There was no sign of displeasure, or even
of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). They were perfectly free from any jealousy of Mansfield.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was as welcome to wish herself there as to be there.

<p/>It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not
known before what pleasures she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _had_ to lose in passing March and April
in a town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not known before how much the beginnings and progress
of vegetation had delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). What animation, both of body and mind,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had derived from watching the advance of that season which cannot,
in spite of its capriciousness, be unlovely, and seeing its increasing
beauties from the earliest flowers in the warmest divisions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
aunt's garden, to the opening of leaves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle's plantations, and
the glory of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) woods. To be losing such pleasures was no trifle; to
be losing them, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in the midst of closeness and noise,
to have confinement, bad air, bad smells, substituted for liberty,
freshness, fragrance, and verdure, was infinitely worse: but even these
incitements to regret were feeble, compared with what arose from the
conviction of being missed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) best friends, and the longing to be
useful to those who were wanting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)!

<p/>Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have been at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have been of service to every
creature in the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have been of use to all.
To all she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have saved some trouble of head or hand; and were it
only in supporting the spirits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from
the evil of solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless, officious
companion, too apt to be heightening danger in order to enhance her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own
importance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being there would have been a general good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) loved to
fancy how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have talked to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and tried at once to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feel the blessing of what was, and
prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind for what might be; and how many walks up and down
stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and how many messages she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have
carried.

<p/>It astonished her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that Tom's sisters could be satisfied with remaining
in London at such a time, through an illness which had now, under
different degrees of danger, lasted several weeks. _They_ might return
to Mansfield when they chose; travelling could be no difficulty to
_them_, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not comprehend how both could still keep away.
If Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations, Julia was
certainly able to quit London whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) chose. It appeared from one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) aunt's letters that Julia had offered to return if wanted, but
this was all. It was evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) would rather remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was.

<p/>Fanny was disposed to think the influence of London very much at war
with all respectable attachments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw the proof of it in Miss
Crawford, as well as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cousins; _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ attachment to Edmund had been
respectable, the most respectable part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) character; her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) friendship
for herself had at least been blameless. Where was either sentiment now?
It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
some reason to think lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelt
on. It was weeks since she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had heard anything of Miss Crawford or of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) other connexions in town, except through Mansfield, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
beginning to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might never know whether Mr. Crawford had
gone into Norfolk again or not till they met, and might never hear from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister any more this spring, when the following letter was received
to revive old and create some new sensations--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, my dear Fanny, as soon as you can, for my long silence, and
behave as if you could forgive me directly. This is my modest request
and expectation, for you are so good, that I depend upon being treated
better than I deserve, and I write now to beg an immediate answer. I
want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you, no doubt,
are perfectly able to give it. One should be a brute not to feel for the
distress they are in; and from what I hear, poor Mr. Bertram has a bad
chance of ultimate recovery. I thought little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) illness at first.
I looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) as the sort of person to be made a fuss with, and to
make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder, and was chiefly concerned
for those who had to nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); but now it is confidently asserted that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) is really in a decline, that the symptoms are most alarming, and that
part of the family, at least, are aware of it. If it be so, I am sure
you must be included in that part, that discerning part, and therefore
entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed. I need
not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake, but
the report is so prevalent that I confess I cannot help trembling. To
have such a fine young man cut off in the flower of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days is most
melancholy. Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully. I really am quite
agitated on the subject. Fanny, Fanny, I see you smile and look cunning,
but, upon my honour, I never bribed a physician in my life. Poor young
man! If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to die, there will be _two_ poor young men less in the
world; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one,
that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of
them. It was a foolish precipitation last Christmas, but the evil of
a few days may be blotted out in part. Varnish and gilding hide many
stains. It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name. With real
affection, Fanny, like mine, more might be overlooked. Write to me by
return of post, judge of my anxiety, and do not trifle with it. Tell me
the real truth, as you have it from the fountainhead. And now, do
not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own.
Believe me, they are not only natural, they are philanthropic and
virtuous. I put it to your conscience, whether `Sir Edmund' would not do
more good with all the Bertram property than any other possible `Sir.'
Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you, but you are
now the only one I can apply to for the truth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sisters not being
within my reach. Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers
at Twickenham -LRB-as to be sure you know-RRB-, and is not yet returned; and
Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square, but I forget
their name and street. Could I immediately apply to either, however, I
should still prefer you, because it strikes me that they have all along
been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up, as to shut their
eyes to the truth. I suppose Mrs. R.'s Easter holidays will not last
much longer; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>). The Aylmers
are pleasant people; and her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) husband away, she (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) can have nothing but
enjoyment. I give her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) credit for promoting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) going dutifully down to
Bath, to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother; but how will she (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) and the dowager agree in one
house? Henry is not at hand, so I have nothing to say from him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Do not
you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago, but for this
illness?--Yours ever, Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it. Mrs. R. knows a decline
is apprehended; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) this morning: she (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) returns to Wimpole Street
to-day; the old lady is come. Now do not make yourself uneasy with any
queer fancies because he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has been spending a few days at Richmond. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
does it every spring. Be assured he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cares for nobody but you. At this
very moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is wild to see you, and occupied only in contriving the
means for doing so, and for making his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pleasure conduce to yours. In
proof, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) repeats, and more eagerly, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said at Portsmouth about
our conveying you home, and I join him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in it with all my soul. Dear
Fanny, write directly, and tell us to come. It will do us all good.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and I can go to the Parsonage, you know, and be no trouble to our
friends at Mansfield Park. It would really be gratifying to see them
all again, and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to
them; and as to yourself, you must feel yourself to be so wanted there,
that you cannot in conscience--conscientious as you are--keep away, when
you have the means of returning. I have not time or patience to give
half Henry's messages; be satisfied that the spirit of each and every
one is unalterable affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny's disgust at the greater part of this letter, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) extreme
reluctance to bring the writer of it and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Edmund together,
would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt-RRB- incapable of judging impartially
whether the concluding offer might be accepted or not. To herself,
individually, it was most tempting. To be finding herself, perhaps
within three days, transported to Mansfield, was an image of the
greatest felicity, but it would have been a material drawback to be
owing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct, at the
present moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw so much to condemn: the sister's feelings,
the brother's conduct, _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ cold-hearted ambition, _his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)_ thoughtless
vanity. To have him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) still the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps, of Mrs.
Rushworth! She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was mortified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had thought better of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Happily,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was not left to weigh and decide between opposite
inclinations and doubtful notions of right; there was no occasion to
determine whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had a rule to apply to, which settled everything. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) uncle,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dread of taking a liberty with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), made it instantly plain to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must absolutely decline the proposal. If he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
wanted, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would send for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and even to offer an early return was
a presumption which hardly anything would have seemed to justify. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
thanked Miss Crawford, but gave a decided negative. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) uncle,
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) understood, meant to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); and as her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cousin's illness had
continued so many weeks without her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) being thought at all necessary,
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) must suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) return would be unwelcome at present, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
should be felt an encumbrance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) representation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin's state at this time was exactly
according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own belief of it, and such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) supposed would convey
to the sanguine mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) correspondent the hope of everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
wishing for. Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it seemed,
under certain conditions of wealth; and this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) suspected, was all
the conquest of prejudice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was so ready to congratulate himself
upon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but money.



<p/>CHAPTER XLVI

<p/>As Fanny could not doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) answer was conveying a real
disappointment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was rather in expectation, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knowledge of
Miss Crawford's temper, of being urged again; and though no second
letter arrived for the space of a week, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had still the same feeling
when it did come.

<p/>On receiving it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could instantly decide on its containing little
writing, and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of haste
and business. Its object was unquestionable; and two moments were enough
to start the probability of its being merely to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) notice that
they should be in Portsmouth that very day, and to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) into all
the agitation of doubting what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to do in such a case. If two
moments, however, can surround with difficulties, a third can disperse
them; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had opened the letter, the possibility of Mr. and
Miss Crawford's having applied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle and obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) permission
was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) ease. This was the letter--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A most scandalous, ill-natured rumour has just reached me, and I write,
dear Fanny, to warn you against giving the least credit to it, should it
spread into the country. Depend upon it, there is some mistake, and that
a day or two will clear it up; at any rate, that Henry is blameless, and
in spite of a moment's _etourderie_, thinks of nobody but you. Say not a
word of it; hear nothing, surmise nothing, whisper nothing till I
write again. I am sure it will be all hushed up, and nothing proved but
Rushworth's folly. If they are gone, I would lay my life they are only
gone to Mansfield Park, and Julia with them. But why would not you let
us come for you? I wish you may not repent it.--Yours, etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny stood aghast. As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour had reached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to understand much of this strange
letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Street
and Mr. Crawford, and only conjecture that something very imprudent had
just occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world, and to
excite her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) jealousy, in Miss Crawford's apprehension, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heard it.
Miss Crawford need not be alarmed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was only sorry for the
parties concerned and for Mansfield, if the report should spread so far;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped it might not. If the Rushworths were gone themselves to
Mansfield, as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said, it was
not likely that anything unpleasant should have preceded them, or at
least should make any impression.

<p/>As to Mr. Crawford, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped it might give him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) a knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own
disposition, convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was not capable of being steadily
attached to any one woman in the world, and shame him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) from persisting
any longer in addressing herself.

<p/>It was very strange! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had begun to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and to
fancy his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) something more than common; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister
still said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cared for nobody else. Yet there must have been some
marked display of attentions to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cousin, there must have been some
strong indiscretion, since her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) correspondent was not of a sort to regard
a slight one.

<p/>Very uncomfortable she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was, and must continue, till she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heard from
Miss Crawford again. It was impossible to banish the letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
thoughts, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not relieve herself by speaking of it to any
human being. Miss Crawford need not have urged secrecy with so much
warmth; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might have trusted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sense of what was due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
cousin.

<p/>The next day came and brought no second letter. Fanny was disappointed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could still think of little else all the morning; but, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
father came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was so far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel that
the subject was for a moment out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was deep in other musing. The remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first evening in
that room, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) newspaper, came across her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). No candle
was now wanted. The sun was yet an hour and half above the horizon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had, indeed, been three months there; and the sun's rays
falling strongly into the parlour, instead of cheering, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) still
more melancholy, for sunshine appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a totally different
thing in a town and in the country. Here, its power was only a glare:
a stifling, sickly glare, serving but to bring forward stains and dirt
that might otherwise have slept. There was neither health nor gaiety in
sunshine in a town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloud
of moving dust, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes could only wander from the walls, marked by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's head, to the table cut and notched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brothers, where
stood the tea-board never thoroughly cleaned, the cups and saucers wiped
in streaks, the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin blue, and the
bread and butter growing every minute more greasy than even Rebecca's
hands had first produced it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) father read his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) newspaper, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>)
mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual, while the tea was
in preparation, and wished Rebecca would mend it; and Fanny was first
roused by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) calling out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), after humphing and considering over
a particular paragraph: <div class="bookquote">``What's the name of your great cousins in town,
Fan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment's recollection enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to say, <div class="bookquote">``Rushworth, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't they live in Wimpole Street?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, there's the devil to pay among them, that's all! There''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-holding
out the paper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``much good may such fine relations do you. I
don't know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) may be too much
of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughter the less. But,
by G--! if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) belonged to _me_, I'd give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the rope's end as long as
I could stand over her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). A little flogging for man and woman too would be
the best way of preventing such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny read to herself that <div class="bookquote">``it was with infinite concern the newspaper
had to announce to the world a matrimonial _fracas_ in the family of
Mr. R. of Wimpole Street; the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not long
been enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised to become
so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world, having quitted her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>)
husband's roof in company with the well-known and captivating Mr. C.,
the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known even
to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a mistake, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny instantly; <div class="bookquote">``it must be a mistake, it
cannot be true; it must mean some other people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke with
a resolution which sprung from despair, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not,
could not believe herself. It had been the shock of conviction as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
read. The truth rushed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have spoken at all,
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could even have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder to
herself.

<p/>Mr. Price cared too little about the report to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) much answer.
<div class="bookquote">``It might be all a lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) acknowledged; <div class="bookquote">``but so many fine ladies were
going to the devil nowadays that way, that there was no answering for
anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I hope it is not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Price plaintively; <div class="bookquote">``it would
be so very shocking! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet,
I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times; have not I, Betsey? And
it would not be ten minutes' work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div><p/>The horror of a mind like Fanny's, as it received the conviction of such
guilt, and began to take in some part of the misery that must ensue, can
hardly be described. At first, it was a sort of stupefaction; but every
moment was quickening her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) perception of the horrible evil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not
doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dared not indulge a hope, of the paragraph being false. Miss
Crawford's letter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had read so often as to make every line
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own, was in frightful conformity with it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eager defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
brother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hope of its being _hushed_ _up_, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) evident agitation,
were all of a piece with something very bad; and if there was a woman
of character in existence, who could treat as a trifle this sin of the
first magnitude, who would try to gloss it over, and desire to have it
unpunished, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could believe Miss Crawford to be the woman! Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
could see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own mistake as to _who_ were gone, or _said_ to be
gone. It was not Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth; it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr.
Crawford.

<p/>Fanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before. There was no
possibility of rest. The evening passed without a pause of misery, the
night was totally sleepless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) passed only from feelings of sickness
to shudderings of horror; and from hot fits of fever to cold. The event
was so shocking, that there were moments even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart revolted
from it as impossible: when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought it could not be. A woman married
only six months ago; a man professing himself devoted, even _engaged_ to
another; that other her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) near relation; the whole family, both families
connected as they were by tie upon tie; all friends, all intimate
together! It was too horrible a confusion of guilt, too gross a
complication of evil, for human nature, not in a state of utter
barbarism, to be capable of! yet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) judgment told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) it was so.
_His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ unsettled affections, wavering with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vanity, _Maria's_
decided attachment, and no sufficient principle on either side, gave it
possibility: Miss Crawford's letter stampt it a fact.

<p/>What would be the consequence? Whom would it not injure? Whose views
might it not affect? Whose peace would it not cut up for ever? Miss
Crawford, herself, Edmund; but it was dangerous, perhaps, to tread
such ground. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) confined herself, or tried to confine herself, to the
simple, indubitable family misery which must envelop all, if it were
indeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure. The mother's
sufferings, the father's; there she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused. Julia's, Tom's, Edmund's;
there a yet longer pause. They were the two on whom it would fall most
horribly. Sir Thomas's parental solicitude and high sense of honour and
decorum, Edmund's upright principles, unsuspicious temper, and genuine
strength of feeling, made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) think it scarcely possible for them to
support life and reason under such disgrace; and it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
that, as far as this world alone was concerned, the greatest blessing to
every one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be instant annihilation.

<p/>Nothing happened the next day, or the next, to weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) terrors. Two
posts came in, and brought no refutation, public or private. There was
no second letter to explain away the first from Miss Crawford; there was
no intelligence from Mansfield, though it was now full time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
to hear again from her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) aunt. This was an evil omen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had, indeed,
scarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind, and was reduced to so
low and wan and trembling a condition, as no mother, not unkind, except
Mrs. Price could have overlooked, when the third day did bring the
sickening knock, and a letter was again put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) hands. It bore the
London postmark, and came from Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Fanny,--You know our present wretchedness. May God support you
under your share! We have been here two days, but there is nothing to
be done. They cannot be traced. You may not have heard of the last
blow--Julia's elopement; she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) is gone to Scotland with Yates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) left
London a few hours before we entered it. At any other time this would
have been felt dreadfully. Now it seems nothing; yet it is an heavy
aggravation. My father is not overpowered. More cannot be hoped. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is
still able to think and act; and I write, by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) desire, to propose your
returning home. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is anxious to get you there for my mother's sake. I
shall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this, and hope to
find you ready to set off for Mansfield. My father wishes you to invite
Susan to go with you for a few months. Settle it as you like; say what
is proper; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kindness at
such a moment! Do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meaning, however I may confuse it. You
may imagine something of my present state. There is no end of the evil
let loose upon us. You will see me early by the mail.--Yours, etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Never had Fanny more wanted a cordial. Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt such a one
as this letter contained. To-morrow! to leave Portsmouth to-morrow!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was, in the greatest danger of being exquisitely
happy, while so many were miserable. The evil which brought such good
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dreaded lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should learn to be insensible of it. To be
going so soon, sent for so kindly, sent for as a comfort, and with leave
to take Susan, was altogether such a combination of blessings as set her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
heart in a glow, and for a time seemed to distance every pain, and
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) incapable of suitably sharing the distress even of those
whose distress she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) thought of most. Julia's elopement could affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
comparatively but little; she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was amazed and shocked; but it could not
occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), could not dwell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was obliged to call herself
to think of it, and acknowledge it to be terrible and grievous, or it
was escaping her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), in the midst of all the agitating pressing joyful
cares attending this summons to herself.

<p/>There is nothing like employment, active indispensable employment, for
relieving sorrow. Employment, even melancholy, may dispel melancholy,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) occupations were hopeful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had so much to do, that not even
the horrible story of Mrs. Rushworth--now fixed to the last point of
certainty could affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) as it had done before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had not time to
be miserable. Within twenty-four hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was hoping to be gone; her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
father and mother must be spoken to, Susan prepared, everything got
ready. Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough. The
happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was imparting, too, happiness very little alloyed by the
black communication which must briefly precede it--the joyful consent
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father and mother to Susan's going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)--the general
satisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded, and the
ecstasy of Susan herself, was all serving to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) spirits.

<p/>The affliction of the Bertrams was little felt in the family. Mrs. Price
talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) poor sister for a few minutes, but how to find anything to
hold Susan's clothes, because Rebecca took away all the boxes and spoilt
them, was much more in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) thoughts: and as for Susan, now unexpectedly
gratified in the first wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) heart, and knowing nothing personally
of those who had sinned, or of those who were sorrowing--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could
help rejoicing from beginning to end, it was as much as ought to be
expected from human virtue at fourteen.

<p/>As nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price, or the good
offices of Rebecca, everything was rationally and duly accomplished,
and the girls were ready for the morrow. The advantage of much sleep
to prepare them for their journey was impossible. The cousin who was
travelling towards them could hardly have less than visited their
agitated spirits--one all happiness, the other all varying and
indescribable perturbation.

<p/>By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house. The girls heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
entrance from above, and Fanny went down. The idea of immediately seeing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), with the knowledge of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must be suffering, brought back all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own first feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) so near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and in misery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was ready to
sink as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) entered the parlour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was alone, and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) instantly;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found herself pressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart with only these words, just
articulate, <div class="bookquote">``My Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
say nothing; nor for some minutes could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) say more.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) turned away to recover himself, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) spoke again, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
voice still faltered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) manner shewed the wish of self-command, and
the resolution of avoiding any farther allusion. <div class="bookquote">``Have you breakfasted?
When shall you be ready? Does Susan go?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were questions following each
other rapidly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) great object was to be off as soon as possible. When
Mansfield was considered, time was precious; and the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) own
mind made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) find relief only in motion. It was settled that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) should
order the carriage to the door in half an hour. Fanny answered for their
having breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) had already
ate, and declined staying for their meal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) would walk round the
ramparts, and join them with the carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) was gone again; glad to
get away even from Fanny.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) looked very ill; evidently suffering under violent emotions, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)
was determined to suppress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew it must be so, but it was terrible
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>The carriage came; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) entered the house again at the same
moment, just in time to spend a few minutes with the family, and be a
witness--but that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) saw nothing--of the tranquil manner in which the
daughters were parted with, and just in time to prevent their sitting
down to the breakfast-table, which, by dint of much unusual activity,
was quite and completely ready as the carriage drove from the door.
Fanny's last meal in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's house was in character with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was dismissed from it as hospitably as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been welcomed.

<p/>How her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) passed the barriers
of Portsmouth, and how Susan's face wore its broadest smiles, may be
easily conceived. Sitting forwards, however, and screened by her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) bonnet,
those smiles were unseen.

<p/>The journey was likely to be a silent one. Edmund's deep sighs often
reached Fanny. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) been alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart must have opened
in spite of every resolution; but Susan's presence drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) quite into
himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be
long supported.

<p/>Fanny watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) with never-failing solicitude, and sometimes catching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) eye, revived an affectionate smile, which comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); but the
first day's journey passed without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hearing a word from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) on the
subjects that were weighing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) down. The next morning produced a
little more. Just before their setting out from Oxford, while Susan was
stationed at a window, in eager observation of the departure of a
large family from the inn, the other two were standing by the fire; and
Edmund, particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny's looks, and from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) ignorance of the daily evils of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father's house, attributing an
undue share of the change, attributing _all_ to the recent event, took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and said in a low, but very expressive tone, <div class="bookquote">``No wonder--you
must feel it--you must suffer. How a man who had once loved, could
desert you! But _yours_--your regard was new compared with--Fanny,
think of _me_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>The first division of their journey occupied a long day, and brought
them, almost knocked up, to Oxford; but the second was over at a much
earlier hour. They were in the environs of Mansfield long before the
usual dinner-time, and as they approached the beloved place, the hearts
of both sisters sank a little. Fanny began to dread the meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
aunts and Tom, under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feel
with some anxiety, that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) best manners, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) lately acquired
knowledge of what was practised here, was on the point of being called
into action. Visions of good and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and new
gentilities, were before her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was meditating much upon silver
forks, napkins, and finger-glasses. Fanny had been everywhere awake to
the difference of the country since February; but when they entered the
Park her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) perceptions and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pleasures were of the keenest sort. It was
three months, full three months, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) quitting it, and the
change was from winter to summer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eye fell everywhere on lawns
and plantations of the freshest green; and the trees, though not fully
clothed, were in that delightful state when farther beauty is known to
be at hand, and when, while much is actually given to the sight, more
yet remains for the imagination. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) enjoyment, however, was for herself
alone. Edmund could not share it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was leaning
back, sunk in a deeper gloom than ever, and with eyes closed, as if the
view of cheerfulness oppressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and the lovely scenes of home must
be shut out.

<p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) melancholy again; and the knowledge of what must be enduring
there, invested even the house, modern, airy, and well situated as it
was, with a melancholy aspect.

<p/>By one of the suffering party within they were expected with such
impatience as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never known before. Fanny had scarcely passed the
solemn-looking servants, when Lady Bertram came from the drawing-room
to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); came with no indolent step; and falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) neck, said,
<div class="bookquote">``Dear Fanny! now I shall be comfortable.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLVII

<p/>It had been a miserable party, each of the three believing themselves
most miserable. Mrs. Norris, however, as most attached to Maria, was
really the greatest sufferer. Maria was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) first favourite, the dearest
of all; the match had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own contriving, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been wont with
such pride of heart to feel and say, and this conclusion of it almost
overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was an altered creature, quieted, stupefied, indifferent to
everything that passed. The being left with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sister and nephew, and
all the house under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) care, had been an advantage entirely thrown
away; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been unable to direct or dictate, or even fancy herself
useful. When really touched by affliction, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) active powers had been
all benumbed; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) the
smallest support or attempt at support. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had done no more for them
than they had done for each other. They had been all solitary, helpless,
and forlorn alike; and now the arrival of the others only established
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) superiority in wretchedness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) companions were relieved, but there
was no good for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_. Edmund was almost as welcome to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother
as Fanny to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having comfort from
either, was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom, in
the blindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) anger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could have charged as the daemon of the
piece. Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened.

<p/>Susan too was a grievance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had not spirits to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) in more
than a few repulsive looks, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) as a spy, and an intruder,
and an indigent niece, and everything most odious. By her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) other aunt,
Susan was received with quiet kindness. Lady Bertram could not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
much time, or many words, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), as Fanny's sister, to have
a claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and Susan
was more than satisfied, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) came perfectly aware that nothing but
ill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided
with happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape from
many certain evils, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could have stood against a great deal more
indifference than she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) met with from the others.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted with the
house and grounds as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could, and spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) days very happily in so
doing, while those who might otherwise have attended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) were shut
up, or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them, at
this time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying to bury his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own
feelings in exertions for the relief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother's, and Fanny devoted
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram, returning to every former office with more than
former zeal, and thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could never do enough for one who seemed
so much to want her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny, talk and lament, was all
Lady Bertram's consolation. To be listened to and borne with, and hear
the voice of kindness and sympathy in return, was everything that could
be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>). To be otherwise comforted was out of the question. The
case admitted of no comfort. Lady Bertram did not think deeply, but,
guided by Sir Thomas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) thought justly on all important points; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) saw, therefore, in all its enormity, what had happened, and neither
endeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), to think little
of guilt and infamy.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) affections were not acute, nor was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind tenacious. After a time,
Fanny found it not impossible to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts to other subjects,
and revive some interest in the usual occupations; but whenever Lady
Bertram _was_ fixed on the event, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could see it only in one light, as
comprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace never to be wiped
off.

<p/>Fanny learnt from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) all the particulars which had yet transpired. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
aunt was no very methodical narrator, but with the help of some letters
to and from Sir Thomas, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) already knew herself, and could
reasonably combine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon able to understand quite as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
wished of the circumstances attending the story.

<p/>Mrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays, to Twickenham, with
a family whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had just grown intimate with: a family of lively,
agreeable manners, and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for to
_their_ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) having
been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew. Mr. Rushworth had
been gone at this time to Bath, to pass a few days with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) mother, and
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back to town, and Maria was with these friends without any
restraint, without even Julia; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street
two or three weeks before, on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas;
a removal which her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) father and mother were now disposed to attribute
to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates's account. Very soon after the
Rushworths' return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received a letter
from an old and most particular friend in London, who hearing and
witnessing a good deal to alarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in that quarter, wrote to recommend
Sir Thomas's coming to London himself, and using his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) influence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to
unpleasant remarks, and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy.

<p/>Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter, without communicating
its contents to any creature at Mansfield, when it was followed by
another, sent express from the same friend, to break to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the almost
desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people.
Mrs. Rushworth had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) husband's house: Mr. Rushworth had been
in great anger and distress to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)_ -LRB-Mr. Harding-RRB- for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) advice; Mr.
Harding feared there had been _at_ _least_ very flagrant indiscretion.
The maidservant of Mrs. Rushworth, senior, threatened alarmingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
was doing all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) power to quiet everything, with the hope of Mrs.
Rushworth's return, but was so much counteracted in Wimpole Street by
the influence of Mr. Rushworth's mother, that the worst consequences
might be apprehended.

<p/>This dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest of the
family. Sir Thomas set off, Edmund would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and the others had
been left in a state of wretchedness, inferior only to what followed
the receipt of the next letters from London. Everything was by that time
public beyond a hope. The servant of Mrs. Rushworth, the mother, had
exposure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) power, and supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) mistress, was not to be
silenced. The two ladies, even in the short time they had been
together, had disagreed; and the bitterness of the elder against her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
daughter-in-law might perhaps arise almost as much from the personal
disrespect with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had herself been treated as from sensibility
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) son.

<p/>However that might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was unmanageable. But had she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) been less
obstinate, or of less weight with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) son, who was always guided by the
last speaker, by the person who could get hold of and shut him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) up, the
case would still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear
again, and there was every reason to conclude her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) to be concealed
somewhere with Mr. Crawford, who had quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle's house, as for a
journey, on the very day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) absenting herself.

<p/>Sir Thomas, however, remained yet a little longer in town, in the hope
of discovering and snatching her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) from farther vice, though all was lost
on the side of character.

<p/>_His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)_ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of. There was but
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) children who was not at this time a source of misery to
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). Tom's complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
sister's conduct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) recovery so much thrown back by it, that even
Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) alarms were
regularly sent off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) husband; and Julia's elopement, the additional
blow which had met him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arrival in London, though its force had
been deadened at the moment, must, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) knew, be sorely felt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) saw
that it was. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) letters expressed how much he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deplored it. Under any
circumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance; but to have it
so clandestinely formed, and such a period chosen for its completion,
placed Julia's feelings in a most unfavourable light, and severely
aggravated the folly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) choice. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) called it a bad thing, done in
the worst manner, and at the worst time; and though Julia was yet as
more pardonable than Maria as folly than vice, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not but
regard the step she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a
conclusion hereafter like her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister's. Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opinion of the set
into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had thrown herself.

<p/>Fanny felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) most acutely. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could have no comfort but in Edmund.
Every other child must be racking his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) displeasure against
herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) trusted, reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris, would now
be done away. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)_ should be justified. Mr. Crawford would have fully
acquitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) conduct in refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); but this, though most material
to herself, would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) uncle's
displeasure was terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>); but what could her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) justification or her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
gratitude and attachment do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)? His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stay must be on Edmund alone.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was mistaken, however, in supposing that Edmund gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father no
present pain. It was of a much less poignant nature than what the others
excited; but Sir Thomas was considering his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) happiness as very deeply
involved in the offence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sister and friend; cut off by it, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must be, from the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had been pursuing with undoubted
attachment and strong probability of success; and who, in everything but
this despicable brother, would have been so eligible a connexion. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own behalf, in addition
to all the rest, when they were in town: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had seen or conjectured
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) feelings; and, having reason to think that one interview with Miss
Crawford had taken place, from which Edmund derived only increased
distress, had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
out of town, and had engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in taking Fanny home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, with
a view to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) relief and benefit, no less than theirs. Fanny was not in
the secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle's feelings, Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss
Crawford's character. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) been privy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
son, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not have wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), though her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) twenty
thousand pounds had been forty.

<p/>That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit
of a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) felt the same, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
own conviction was insufficient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted to
be assured of it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would now speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with the unreserve which
had sometimes been too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) before, it would be most consoling;
but _that_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found was not to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seldom saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>): never alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
probably avoided being alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). What was to be inferred? That
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) judgment submitted to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own peculiar and bitter share of this
family affliction, but that it was too keenly felt to be a subject of
the slightest communication. This must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) state. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) yielded, but it
was with agonies which did not admit of speech. Long, long would it be
ere Miss Crawford's name passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) lips again, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could hope for a
renewal of such confidential intercourse as had been.

<p/>It _was_ long. They reached Mansfield on Thursday, and it was not till
Sunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) on the subject. Sitting
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) on Sunday evening--a wet Sunday evening--the very time of
all others when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must be opened, and
everything told; no one else in the room, except his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother, who,
after hearing an affecting sermon, had cried herself to sleep, it was
impossible not to speak; and so, with the usual beginnings, hardly to
be traced as to what came first, and the usual declaration that if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) for a few minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should be very brief, and
certainly never tax her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kindness in the same way again; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) need not
fear a repetition; it would be a subject prohibited entirely: he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) entered
upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first
interest to himself, to one of whose affectionate sympathy he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was quite
convinced.

<p/>How Fanny listened, with what curiosity and concern, what pain and what
delight, how the agitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) voice was watched, and how carefully
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own eyes were fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined. The
opening was alarming. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had seen Miss Crawford. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been invited to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to call;
and regarding it as what was meant to be the last, last interview
of friendship, and investing her (<font color='blue'><b>Stornaway</b></font>) with all the feelings of shame and
wretchedness which Crawford's sister ought to have known, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had gone to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) in such a state of mind, so softened, so devoted, as made it for a
few moments impossible to Fanny's fears that it should be the last. But
as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) proceeded in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) story, these fears were over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, with a serious--certainly a serious--even an agitated air;
but before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been able to speak one intelligible sentence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
introduced the subject in a manner which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) owned had shocked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). ```I
heard you were in town,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); `I wanted to see you. Let us talk
over this sad business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?'
I could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt reproved.
Sometimes how quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) then
added, `I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister's expense.' So
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) began, but how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to be
repeated to you. I cannot recall all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) words. I would not dwell upon
them if I could. Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of each.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reprobated her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother's folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
had never cared for, to do what must lose him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) adored; but
still more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a situation,
plunging into such difficulties, under the idea of being really loved
by a man who had long ago made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indifference clear. Guess what I must
have felt. To hear the woman whom--no harsher name than folly given!
So voluntarily, so freely, so coolly to canvass it! No reluctance, no
horror, no feminine, shall I say, no modest loathings? This is what the
world does. For where, Fanny, shall we find a woman whom nature had so
richly endowed? Spoilt, spoilt!''

<p/>After a little reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on with a sort of desperate calmness.
<div class="bookquote">``I will tell you everything, and then have done for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw it
only as folly, and that folly stamped only by exposure. The want of
common discretion, of caution: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going down to Richmond for the whole
time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being at Twickenham; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) putting herself in the power of
a servant; it was the detection, in short--oh, Fanny! it was the
detection, not the offence, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reprobated. It was the imprudence
which had brought things to extremity, and obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother to give
up every dearer plan in order to fly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopt. <div class="bookquote">``And what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny -LRB-believing herself required to speak-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``what could you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, nothing to be understood. I was like a man stunned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
went on, began to talk of you; yes, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began to talk of you,
regretting, as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might, the loss of such a--. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke
very rationally. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has always done justice to you. `He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has thrown
away,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), `such a woman as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will never see again. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
have fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happy for ever.' My dearest
Fanny, I am giving you, I hope, more pleasure than pain by this
retrospect of what might have been--but what never can be now. You do
not wish me to be silent? If you do, give me but a look, a word, and I
have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No look or word was given.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We were all disposed to wonder, but it seems to
have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which
knew no guile should not suffer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke of you with high praise and
warm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash of evil; for in
the midst of it she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could exclaim, `Why would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)? It is
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fault. Simple girl! I shall never forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) accepted
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought, they might now have been on the point of marriage, and
Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again.
It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation, in yearly
meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.' Could you have believed it
possible? But the charm is broken. My eyes are opened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cruel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``quite cruel. At such a moment to give way to
gaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you! Absolute cruelty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cruelty, do you call it? We differ there. No, hers is not a cruel
nature. I do not consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) as meaning to wound my feelings. The evil
lies yet deeper: in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there being
such feelings; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) to
treat the subject as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was speaking only as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had been used
to hear others speak, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) imagined everybody else would speak. Hers
are not faults of temper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) would not voluntarily give unnecessary
pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot but think
that for me, for my feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) would--Hers are faults of principle,
Fanny; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind. Perhaps it
is best for me, since it leaves me so little to regret. Not so, however.
Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), rather
than have to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as I do. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; when I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long were you together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five-and-twenty minutes. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went on to say that what remained
now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke of
it, Fanny, with a steadier voice than I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obliged to pause
more than once as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued. ```We must persuade Henry to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); `and what with honour, and the certainty of having shut
himself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair of it. Fanny he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must
give up. I do not think that even _he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)_ could now hope to succeed with
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stamp, and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable
difficulty. My influence, which is not small shall all go that way; and
when once married, and properly supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own family, people of
respectability as they are, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) may recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) footing in society to a
certain degree. In some circles, we know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would never be admitted,
but with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be those
who will be glad of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more
liberality and candour on those points than formerly. What I advise
is, that your father be quiet. Do not let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) injure his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own cause by
interference. Persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to let things take their course. If by any
officious exertions of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is induced to leave Henry's protection,
there will be much less chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) remain
with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I know how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is likely to be influenced. Let Sir Thomas trust
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) get his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
daughter away, it will be destroying the chief hold.'''

<p/>After repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that the
subject had been entered on at all. It was long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could speak
again. At last, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Fanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon have done. I have
told you the substance of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said. As soon as I could speak,
I replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state of
mind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to make
me suffer more, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost
every sentence. That though I had, in the course of our acquaintance,
been often sensible of some difference in our opinions, on points,
too, of some moment, it had not entered my imagination to conceive the
difference could be such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had now proved it. That the manner in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) treated the dreadful crime committed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother and my
sister -LRB-with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say-RRB-,
but the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke of the crime itself, giving it every
reproach but the right; considering its ill consequences only as they
were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in
wrong; and last of all, and above all, recommending to us a compliance,
a compromise, an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin, on the
chance of a marriage which, thinking as I now thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother,
should rather be prevented than sought; all this together most
grievously convinced me that I had never understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) before, and
that, as far as related to mind, it had been the creature of my own
imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been too apt to dwell on
for many months past. That, perhaps, it was best for me; I had less to
regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings, hopes which must, at any
rate, have been torn from me now. And yet, that I must and would confess
that, could I have restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had appeared to me before,
I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting, for the
sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem. This is
what I said, the purport of it; but, as you may imagine, not spoken
so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
astonished, exceedingly astonished--more than astonished. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
change countenance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) turned extremely red. I imagined I saw a
mixture of many feelings: a great, though short struggle; half a wish of
yielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but habit, habit carried
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would have laughed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could. It was a sort of laugh, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
answered, `A pretty good lecture, upon my word. Was it part of your last
sermon? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and
Thornton Lacey; and when I hear of you next, it may be as a celebrated
preacher in some great society of Methodists, or as a missionary into
foreign parts.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) tried to speak carelessly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was not so
careless as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wanted to appear. I only said in reply, that from my
heart I wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) well, and earnestly hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might soon learn
to think more justly, and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could
any of us acquire, the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty, to the
lessons of affliction, and immediately left the room. I had gone a few
steps, Fanny, when I heard the door open behind me. `Mr. Bertram,' said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). I looked back. `Mr. Bertram,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), with a smile; but it was
a smile ill-suited to the conversation that had passed, a saucy playful
smile, seeming to invite in order to subdue me; at least it appeared so
to me. I resisted; it was the impulse of the moment to resist, and still
walked on. I have since, sometimes, for a moment, regretted that I did
not go back, but I know I was right, and such has been the end of our
acquaintance. And what an acquaintance has it been! How have I been
deceived! Equally in brother and sister deceived! I thank you for your
patience, Fanny. This has been the greatest relief, and now we will have
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And such was Fanny's dependence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) words, that for five minutes
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought they _had_ done. Then, however, it all came on again, or
something very like it, and nothing less than Lady Bertram's rousing
thoroughly up could really close such a conversation. Till that
happened, they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
attached him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and how delightful nature had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and how excellent
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would have been, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) fallen into good hands earlier. Fanny, now
at liberty to speak openly, felt more than justified in adding to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) real character, by some hint of what share his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
brother's state of health might be supposed to have in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wish for a
complete reconciliation. This was not an agreeable intimation. Nature
resisted it for a while. It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to
have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) more disinterested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attachment; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) vanity was
not of a strength to fight long against reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) submitted to believe
that Tom's illness had influenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), only reserving for himself this
consoling thought, that considering the many counteractions of opposing
habits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had certainly been _more_ attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) than could have
been expected, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sake been more near doing right. Fanny
thought exactly the same; and they were also quite agreed in their
opinion of the lasting effect, the indelible impression, which such
a disappointment must make on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind. Time would undoubtedly abate
somewhat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sufferings, but still it was a sort of thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
never could get entirely the better of; and as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) ever meeting with
any other woman who could--it was too impossible to be named but with
indignation. Fanny's friendship was all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had to cling to.



<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII

<p/>Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects
as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault
themselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with all the rest.

<p/>My Fanny, indeed, at this very time, I have the satisfaction of knowing,
must have been happy in spite of everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have been a happy
creature in spite of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt, or thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt, for the
distress of those around her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had sources of delight that must force
their way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was returned to Mansfield Park, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was useful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
beloved; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was safe from Mr. Crawford; and when Sir Thomas came back
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had every proof that could be given in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) then melancholy state of
spirits, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) perfect approbation and increased regard; and happy as
all this must make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would still have been happy without any of
it, for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford.

<p/>It is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was suffering
from disappointment and regret, grieving over what was, and wishing for
what could never be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) knew it was so, and was sorry; but it was with
a sorrow so founded on satisfaction, so tending to ease, and so much in
harmony with every dearest sensation, that there are few who might not
have been glad to exchange their greatest gaiety for it.

<p/>Sir Thomas, poor Sir Thomas, a parent, and conscious of errors in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
own conduct as a parent, was the longest to suffer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
ought not to have allowed the marriage; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughter's sentiments
had been sufficiently known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to render him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) culpable in authorising
it; that in so doing he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had sacrificed the right to the expedient, and
been governed by motives of selfishness and worldly wisdom. These were
reflections that required some time to soften; but time will do almost
everything; and though little comfort arose on Mrs. Rushworth's side for
the misery she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had occasioned, comfort was to be found greater than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had supposed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) other children. Julia's match became a less
desperate business than he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had considered it at first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was humble,
and wishing to be forgiven; and Mr. Yates, desirous of being really
received into the family, was disposed to look up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) and be guided.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) was not very solid; but there was a hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) becoming less
trifling, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) being at least tolerably domestic and quiet; and at any
rate, there was comfort in finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) estate rather more, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) debts
much less, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) had feared, and in being consulted and treated as
the friend best worth attending to. There was comfort also in Tom, who
gradually regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) health, without regaining the thoughtlessness and
selfishness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) previous habits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was the better for ever for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
illness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had suffered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had learned to think: two advantages
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had never known before; and the self-reproach arising from the
deplorable event in Wimpole Street, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt himself accessory
by all the dangerous intimacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) unjustifiable theatre, made an
impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind which, at the age of six-and-twenty, with no want
of sense or good companions, was durable in its happy effects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) became
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ought to be: useful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father, steady and quiet, and not
living merely for himself.

<p/>Here was comfort indeed! and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place
dependence on such sources of good, Edmund was contributing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
father's ease by improvement in the only point in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) pain before--improvement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) spirits. After wandering about and
sitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had so well
talked his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again.

<p/>These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually brought their
alleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sense of what was lost, and
in part reconciling him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to himself; though the anguish arising from the
conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own errors in the education of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters was never
to be entirely done away.

<p/>Too late he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) became aware how unfavourable to the character of any young
people must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and Julia had
been always experiencing at home, where the excessive indulgence and
flattery of their aunt had been continually contrasted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own
severity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) saw how ill he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had judged, in expecting to counteract what
was wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself; clearly saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
had but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and
sending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able to
attach them only by the blindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) affection, and the excess of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) praise.

<p/>Here had been grievous mismanagement; but, bad as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) gradually
grew to feel that it had not been the most direful mistake in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) plan
of education. Something must have been wanting _within_, or time would
have worn away much of its ill effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) feared that principle, active
principle, had been wanting; that they had never been properly taught
to govern their inclinations and tempers by that sense of duty which can
alone suffice. They had been instructed theoretically in their religion,
but never required to bring it into daily practice. To be distinguished
for elegance and accomplishments, the authorised object of their youth,
could have had no useful influence that way, no moral effect on the
mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had meant them to be good, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) cares had been directed to
the understanding and manners, not the disposition; and of the necessity
of self-denial and humility, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) feared they had never heard from any
lips that could profit them.

<p/>Bitterly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) deplore a deficiency which now he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could scarcely
comprehend to have been possible. Wretchedly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) feel, that with all
the cost and care of an anxious and expensive education, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had brought
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters without their understanding their first duties, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
being acquainted with their character and temper.

<p/>The high spirit and strong passions of Mrs. Rushworth, especially, were
made known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) only in their sad result. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was not to be prevailed
on to leave Mr. Crawford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) hoped to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and they continued
together till she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain,
and till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the conviction
rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) temper so bad, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) feelings for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) so like hatred,
as to make them for a while each other's punishment, and then induce a
voluntary separation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to be reproached as the ruin of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) happiness
in Fanny, and carried away no better consolation in leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) than
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _had_ divided them. What can exceed the misery of such a mind
in such a situation?

<p/>Mr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce; and so ended a
marriage contracted under such circumstances as to make any better end
the effect of good luck not to be reckoned on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>),
and loved another; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had been very much aware that it was so. The
indignities of stupidity, and the disappointments of selfish passion,
can excite little pity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) punishment followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) conduct, as did a
deeper punishment the deeper guilt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) wife. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)_ was released from
the engagement to be mortified and unhappy, till some other pretty girl
could attract him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) into matrimony again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) might set forward on a
second, and, it is to be hoped, more prosperous trial of the state: if
duped, to be duped at least with good humour and good luck; while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
must withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings to a retirement and
reproach which could allow no second spring of hope or character.

<p/>Where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could be placed became a subject of most melancholy and
momentous consultation. Mrs. Norris, whose attachment seemed to augment
with the demerits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) niece, would have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) received at home
and countenanced by them all. Sir Thomas would not hear of it; and Mrs.
Norris's anger against Fanny was so much the greater, from considering
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ residence there as the motive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) persisted in placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
scruples to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ account, though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
that, had there been no young woman in question, had there been no young
person of either sex belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), to be endangered by the society
or hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would never have offered
so great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>).
As a daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hoped a penitent one, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) should be protected by him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>),
and secured in every comfort, and supported by every encouragement to do
right, which their relative situations admitted; but farther than _that_
he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could not go. Maria had destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own character, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would
not, by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored, by
affording his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sanction to vice, or in seeking to lessen its disgrace, be
anywise accessory to introducing such misery in another man's family as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known himself.

<p/>It ended in Mrs. Norris's resolving to quit Mansfield and devote herself
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) unfortunate Maria, and in an establishment being formed for them
in another country, remote and private, where, shut up together with
little society, on one side no affection, on the other no judgment,
it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their mutual
punishment.

<p/>Mrs. Norris's removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary comfort
of Sir Thomas's life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had been sinking from the day
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) return from Antigua: in every transaction together from that
period, in their daily intercourse, in business, or in chat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had
been regularly losing ground in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) esteem, and convincing him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that
either time had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) much disservice, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had considerably
over-rated her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sense, and wonderfully borne with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) manners before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) as an hourly evil, which was so much the worse, as there
seemed no chance of its ceasing but with life; she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) seemed a part of
himself that must be borne for ever. To be relieved from her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), therefore,
was so great a felicity that, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) not left bitter remembrances
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), there might have been danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) learning almost to
approve the evil which produced such a good.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was regretted by no one at Mansfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had never been able to
attach even those she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) loved best; and since Mrs. Rushworth's elopement,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
everywhere tormenting. Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris, not
even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was gone for ever.

<p/>That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing, in some measure, to a
favourable difference of disposition and circumstance, but in a greater
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) having been less the darling of that very aunt, less flattered
and less spoilt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) beauty and acquirements had held but a second
place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been always used to think herself a little inferior to
Maria. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) temper was naturally the easiest of the two; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) feelings,
though quick, were more controllable, and education had not given her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) so
very hurtful a degree of self-consequence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had submitted the best to the disappointment in Henry Crawford.
After the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was over,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again;
and when the acquaintance was renewed in town, and Mr. Rushworth's house
became Crawford's object, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had had the merit of withdrawing herself
from it, and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) other friends,
in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted. This had
been her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) motive in going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cousin's. Mr. Yates's convenience had
had nothing to do with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been allowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) attentions some
time, but with very little idea of ever accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>); and had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
sister's conduct burst forth as it did, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) increased dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
father and of home, on that event, imagining its certain consequence
to herself would be greater severity and restraint, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hastily
resolve on avoiding such immediate horrors at all risks, it is probable
that Mr. Yates would never have succeeded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had not eloped with any
worse feelings than those of selfish alarm. It had appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the
only thing to be done. Maria's guilt had induced Julia's folly.

<p/>Henry Crawford, ruined by early independence and bad domestic example,
indulged in the freaks of a cold-blooded vanity a little too long. Once
it had, by an opening undesigned and unmerited, led him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) into the way of
happiness. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) have been satisfied with the conquest of one
amiable woman's affections, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) have found sufficient exultation
in overcoming the reluctance, in working himself into the esteem and
tenderness of Fanny Price, there would have been every probability of
success and felicity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) affection had already done something.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had already given him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) some influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>).
Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) have deserved more, there can be no doubt that more would have
been obtained, especially when that marriage had taken place, which
would have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the assistance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) conscience in subduing her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
first inclination, and brought them very often together. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) have
persevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) reward, and a reward
very voluntarily bestowed, within a reasonable period from Edmund's
marrying Mary.

<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) done as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) intended, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) ought, by going down to
Everingham after his (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) return from Portsmouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) might have been deciding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) own happy destiny. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser's
party; his (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) staying was made of flattering consequence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) was to
meet Mrs. Rushworth there. Curiosity and vanity were both engaged, and
the temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused to
make any sacrifice to right: he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) resolved to defer his (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) Norfolk journey,
resolved that writing should answer the purpose of it, or that its
purpose was unimportant, and staid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) saw Mrs. Rushworth, was received
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive, and have
established apparent indifference between them for ever; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) was
mortified, he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles
had been so wholly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) command: he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) must exert himself to subdue so
proud a display of resentment; it was anger on Fanny's account; he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) must
get the better of it, and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
treatment of himself.

<p/>In this spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) began the attack, and by animated perseverance had
soon re-established the sort of familiar intercourse, of gallantry,
of flirtation, which bounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) views; but in triumphing over the
discretion which, though beginning in anger, might have saved them both,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) had put himself in the power of feelings on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) side more strong
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) had supposed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>); there was no withdrawing attentions
avowedly dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) was entangled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) own vanity, with as little
excuse of love as possible, and without the smallest inconstancy of mind
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cousin. To keep Fanny and the Bertrams from a knowledge of
what was passing became his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) first object. Secrecy could not have been
more desirable for Mrs. Rushworth's credit than he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) felt it for his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) returned from Richmond, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would have been glad to see Mrs.
Rushworth no more. All that followed was the result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) imprudence;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) went off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) at last, because he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could not help it,
regretting Fanny even at the moment, but regretting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) infinitely more
when all the bustle of the intrigue was over, and a very few months had
taught him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), by the force of contrast, to place a yet higher value on the
sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) temper, the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind, and the excellence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) principles.

<p/>That punishment, the public punishment of disgrace, should in a just
measure attend _his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)_ share of the offence is, we know, not one of the
barriers which society gives to virtue. In this world the penalty is
less equal than could be wished; but without presuming to look forward
to a juster appointment hereafter, we may fairly consider a man of
sense, like Henry Crawford, to be providing for himself no small
portion of vexation and regret: vexation that must rise sometimes
to self-reproach, and regret to wretchedness, in having so requited
hospitality, so injured family peace, so forfeited his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) best, most
estimable, and endeared acquaintance, and so lost the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
rationally as well as passionately loved.

<p/>After what had passed to wound and alienate the two families, the
continuance of the Bertrams and Grants in such close neighbourhood would
have been most distressing; but the absence of the latter, for some
months purposely lengthened, ended very fortunately in the necessity, or
at least the practicability, of a permanent removal. Dr. Grant, through
an interest on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had almost ceased to form hopes, succeeded to
a stall in Westminster, which, as affording an occasion for leaving
Mansfield, an excuse for residence in London, and an increase of income
to answer the expenses of the change, was highly acceptable to those who
went and those who staid.

<p/>Mrs. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have gone with some
regret from the scenes and people she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had been used to; but the same
happiness of disposition must in any place, and any society, secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
a great deal to enjoy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had again a home to offer Mary; and Mary
had had enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own friends, enough of vanity, ambition, love, and
disappointment in the course of the last half-year, to be in need of the
true kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister's heart, and the rational tranquillity
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ways. They lived together; and when Dr. Grant had brought on
apoplexy and death, by three great institutionary dinners in one week,
they still lived together; for Mary, though perfectly resolved against
ever attaching herself to a younger brother again, was long in finding
among the dashing representatives, or idle heir-apparents, who were at
the command of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) beauty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) #20,000, any one who could satisfy the
better taste she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had acquired at Mansfield, whose character and manners
could authorise a hope of the domestic happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had there learned
to estimate, or put Edmund Bertram sufficiently out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head.

<p/>Edmund had greatly the advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in this respect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had not to
wait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
in them. Scarcely had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) done regretting Mary Crawford, and observing to
Fanny how impossible it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should ever meet with such another
woman, before it began to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) whether a very different kind of
woman might not do just as well, or a great deal better: whether Fanny
herself were not growing as dear, as important to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) smiles
and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been; and whether it might
not be a possible, an hopeful undertaking to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) warm
and sisterly regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would be foundation enough for wedded love.

<p/>I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that every one may
be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable
passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as
to time in different people. I only entreat everybody to believe that
exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so, and
not a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and
became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.

<p/>With such a regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), indeed, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had long been, a regard
founded on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness, and
completed by every recommendation of growing worth, what could be more
natural than the change? Loving, guiding, protecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been
doing ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being ten years old, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind in so great a degree
formed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) care, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) comfort depending on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) kindness, an
object to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) of such close and peculiar interest, dearer by all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own
importance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than any one else at Mansfield, what was there now
to add, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should learn to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling
dark ones. And being always with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and always talking confidentially,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) feelings exactly in that favourable state which a recent
disappointment gives, those soft light eyes could not be very long in
obtaining the pre-eminence.

<p/>Having once set out, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had done so on this road to
happiness, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) or make
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) progress slow; no doubts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) deserving, no fears of opposition of
taste, no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarity
of temper. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind, disposition, opinions, and habits wanted no
half-concealment, no self-deception on the present, no reliance on
future improvement. Even in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) late infatuation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
acknowledged Fanny's mental superiority. What must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sense of it
now, therefore? She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was of course only too good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); but as nobody
minds having what is too good for them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was very steadily earnest in
the pursuit of the blessing, and it was not possible that encouragement
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be long wanting. Timid, anxious, doubting as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was, it
was still impossible that such tenderness as hers should not, at times,
hold out the strongest hope of success, though it remained for a later
period to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the whole delightful and astonishing truth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
happiness in knowing himself to have been so long the beloved of such a
heart, must have been great enough to warrant any strength of language
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could clothe it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) or to himself; it must have been
a delightful happiness. But there was happiness elsewhere which no
description can reach. Let no one presume to give the feelings of a
young woman on receiving the assurance of that affection of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
has scarcely allowed herself to entertain a hope.

<p/>Their own inclinations ascertained, there were no difficulties behind,
no drawback of poverty or parent. It was a match which Sir Thomas's
wishes had even forestalled. Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions,
prizing more and more the sterling good of principle and temper, and
chiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities all that remained to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) of domestic felicity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had pondered with genuine satisfaction on
the more than possibility of the two young friends finding their natural
consolation in each other for all that had occurred of disappointment to
either; and the joyful consent which met Edmund's application, the high
sense of having realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny for
a daughter, formed just such a contrast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) early opinion on the
subject when the poor little girl's coming had been first agitated, as
time is for ever producing between the plans and decisions of mortals,
for their own instruction, and their neighbours' entertainment.

<p/>Fanny was indeed the daughter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wanted. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) charitable kindness
had been rearing a prime comfort for himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) liberality had a rich
repayment, and the general goodness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) intentions by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) deserved
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) might have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) childhood happier; but it had been an error
of judgment only which had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the appearance of harshness, and
deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) early love; and now, on really knowing each other,
their mutual attachment became very strong. After settling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at
Thornton Lacey with every kind attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) comfort, the object of
almost every day was to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) there, or to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) away from it.

<p/>Selfishly dear as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had long been to Lady Bertram, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could not be
parted with willingly by _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_. No happiness of son or niece could make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) wish the marriage. But it was possible to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), because
Susan remained to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) place. Susan became the stationary niece,
delighted to be so; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of
mind, and an inclination for usefulness, as Fanny had been by sweetness
of temper, and strong feelings of gratitude. Susan could never be
spared. First as a comfort to Fanny, then as an auxiliary, and last as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) substitute, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was established at Mansfield, with every appearance
of equal permanency. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) more fearless disposition and happier nerves
made everything easy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) there. With quickness in understanding
the tempers of those she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had to deal with, and no natural timidity to
restrain any consequent wishes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon welcome and useful to all;
and after Fanny's removal succeeded so naturally to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) influence over
the hourly comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, as gradually to become, perhaps, the
most beloved of the two. In _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ usefulness, in Fanny's excellence,
in William's continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the general
well-doing and success of the other members of the family, all assisting
to advance each other, and doing credit to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) countenance and aid, Sir
Thomas saw repeated, and for ever repeated, reason to rejoice in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
had done for them all, and acknowledge the advantages of early hardship
and discipline, and the consciousness of being born to struggle and
endure.

<p/>With so much true merit and true love, and no want of fortune and
friends, the happiness of the married cousins must appear as secure as
earthly happiness can be. Equally formed for domestic life, and attached
to country pleasures, their home was the home of affection and comfort;
and to complete the picture of good, the acquisition of Mansfield
living, by the death of Dr. Grant, occurred just after they had been
married long enough to begin to want an increase of income, and feel
their distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience.

<p/>On that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage there,
which, under each of its two former owners, Fanny had never been able
to approach but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm, soon
grew as dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart, and as thoroughly perfect in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes, as
everything else within the view and patronage of Mansfield Park had long
been.
