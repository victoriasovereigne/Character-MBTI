<p/>THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE

<p/>by Thomas Hardy




<p/>PREFACE


<p/>The date at which the following events are assumed to have occurred may
be set down as between 1840 and 1850, when the old watering place herein
called <div class="bookquote">``Budmouth''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas Hardy</b></font>)</div>still retained sufficient afterglow from its Georgian
gaiety and prestige to lend it an absorbing attractiveness to the
romantic and imaginative soul of a lonely dweller inland.

<p/>Under the general name of <div class="bookquote">``Egdon Heath,''  (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div>which has been given to the
sombre scene of the story, are united or typified heaths of various real
names, to the number of at least a dozen; these being virtually one in
character and aspect, though their original unity, or partial unity, is
now somewhat disguised by intrusive strips and slices brought under the
plough with varying degrees of success, or planted to woodland.

<p/>It is pleasant to dream that some spot in the extensive tract whose
southwestern quarter is here described, may be the heath of that
traditionary King of Wessex--Lear.


<p/>July, 1895.




<p/><div class="bookquote">``To sorrow
I bade good morrow,
And thought to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) far away behind;
But cheerly, cheerly,
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loves me dearly;
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is so constant to me, and so kind.
I would deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
And so leave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
But ah! she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is so constant and so kind.''




 (<font color='red'><b>THE WOMEN</b></font>)</div><p/>BOOK ONE -- THE THREE WOMEN




<p/>1--A Face on Which Time Makes but Little Impression


<p/>A Saturday afternoon in November was approaching the time of twilight,
and the vast tract of unenclosed wild known as Egdon Heath embrowned
itself moment by moment. Overhead the hollow stretch of whitish cloud
shutting out the sky was as a tent which had the whole heath for its
floor.

<p/>The heaven being spread with this pallid screen and the earth with
the darkest vegetation, their meeting-line at the horizon was clearly
marked. In such contrast the heath wore the appearance of an instalment
of night which had taken up its place before its astronomical hour was
come: darkness had to a great extent arrived hereon, while day stood
distinct in the sky. Looking upwards, a furze-cutter would have been
inclined to continue work; looking down, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) would have decided to
finish his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) faggot and go home. The distant rims of the world and of the
firmament seemed to be a division in time no less than a division in
matter. The face of the heath by its mere complexion added half an
hour to evening; it could in like manner retard the dawn, sadden noon,
anticipate the frowning of storms scarcely generated, and intensify the
opacity of a moonless midnight to a cause of shaking and dread.

<p/>In fact, precisely at this transitional point of its nightly roll into
darkness the great and particular glory of the Egdon waste began, and
nobody could be said to understand the heath who had not been there at
such a time. It could best be felt when it could not clearly be seen,
its complete effect and explanation lying in this and the succeeding
hours before the next dawn; then, and only then, did it tell its true
tale. The spot was, indeed, a near relation of night, and when night
showed itself an apparent tendency to gravitate together could be
perceived in its shades and the scene. The sombre stretch of rounds and
hollows seemed to rise and meet the evening gloom in pure sympathy, the
heath exhaling darkness as rapidly as the heavens precipitated it.
And so the obscurity in the air and the obscurity in the land closed
together in a black fraternization towards which each advanced halfway.

<p/>The place became full of a watchful intentness now; for when other
things sank blooding to sleep the heath appeared slowly to awake and
listen. Every night its Titanic form seemed to await something; but it
had waited thus, unmoved, during so many centuries, through the crises
of so many things, that it could only be imagined to await one last
crisis--the final overthrow.

<p/>It was a spot which returned upon the memory of those who loved it
with an aspect of peculiar and kindly congruity. Smiling champaigns of
flowers and fruit hardly do this, for they are permanently harmonious
only with an existence of better reputation as to its issues than the
present. Twilight combined with the scenery of Egdon Heath to evolve a
thing majestic without severity, impressive without showiness, emphatic
in its admonitions, grand in its simplicity. The qualifications which
frequently invest the facade of a prison with far more dignity than is
found in the facade of a palace double its size lent to this heath a
sublimity in which spots renowned for beauty of the accepted kind are
utterly wanting. Fair prospects wed happily with fair times; but alas,
if times be not fair! Men have oftener suffered from, the mockery of
a place too smiling for their reason than from the oppression of
surroundings oversadly tinged. Haggard Egdon appealed to a subtler and
scarcer instinct, to a more recently learnt emotion, than that which
responds to the sort of beauty called charming and fair.

<p/>Indeed, it is a question if the exclusive reign of this orthodox beauty
is not approaching its last quarter. The new Vale of Tempe may be a
gaunt waste in Thule; human souls may find themselves in closer and
closer harmony with external things wearing a sombreness distasteful to
our race when it was young. The time seems near, if it has not actually
arrived, when the chastened sublimity of a moor, a sea, or a mountain
will be all of nature that is absolutely in keeping with the moods
of the more thinking among mankind. And ultimately, to the commonest
tourist, spots like Iceland may become what the vineyards and myrtle
gardens of South Europe are to him (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) now; and Heidelberg and Baden
be passed unheeded as he (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) hastens from the Alps to the sand dunes of
Scheveningen.

<p/>The most thoroughgoing ascetic could feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) had a natural right to
wander on Egdon--he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) was keeping within the line of legitimate indulgence
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) laid himself open to influences such as these. Colours and
beauties so far subdued were, at least, the birthright of all. Only in
summer days of highest feather did its mood touch the level of gaiety.
Intensity was more usually reached by way of the solemn than by way of
the brilliant, and such a sort of intensity was often arrived at
during winter darkness, tempests, and mists. Then Egdon was aroused to
reciprocity; for the storm was its lover, and the wind its friend.
Then it became the home of strange phantoms; and it was found to be the
hitherto unrecognized original of those wild regions of obscurity which
are vaguely felt to be compassing us about in midnight dreams of flight
and disaster, and are never thought of after the dream till revived by
scenes like this.

<p/>It was at present a place perfectly accordant with man's nature--neither
ghastly, hateful, nor ugly; neither commonplace, unmeaning, nor tame;
but, like man, slighted and enduring; and withal singularly colossal and
mysterious in its swarthy monotony. As with some persons who have long
lived apart, solitude seemed to look out of its countenance. It had a
lonely face, suggesting tragical possibilities.

<p/>This obscure, obsolete, superseded country figures in Domesday.
Its condition is recorded therein as that of heathy, furzy, briary
wilderness--<div class="bookquote">``Bruaria.''  (<font color='red'><b>leagues</b></font>)</div>Then follows the length and breadth in leagues;
and, though some uncertainty exists as to the exact extent of this
ancient lineal measure, it appears from the figures that the area of
Egdon down to the present day has but little diminished. <div class="bookquote">``Turbaria
Bruaria'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--the right of cutting heath-turf--occurs in charters relating
to the district. <div class="bookquote">``Overgrown with heth and mosse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leland</b></font>)</div>says Leland of the
same dark sweep of country.

<p/>Here at least were intelligible facts regarding landscape--far-reaching
proofs productive of genuine satisfaction. The untameable, Ishmaelitish
thing that Egdon now was it always had been. Civilization was its enemy;
and ever since the beginning of vegetation its soil had worn the
same antique brown dress, the natural and invariable garment of the
particular formation. In its venerable one coat lay a certain vein of
satire on human vanity in clothes. A person on a heath in raiment of
modern cut and colours has more or less an anomalous look. We seem to
want the oldest and simplest human clothing where the clothing of the
earth is so primitive.

<p/>To recline on a stump of thorn in the central valley of Egdon, between
afternoon and night, as now, where the eye could reach nothing of the
world outside the summits and shoulders of heathland which filled the
whole circumference of its glance, and to know that everything around
and underneath had been from prehistoric times as unaltered as the stars
overhead, gave ballast to the mind adrift on change, and harassed by the
irrepressible New. The great inviolate place had an ancient permanence
which the sea cannot claim. Who can say of a particular sea that it is
old? Distilled by the sun, kneaded by the moon, it is renewed in a
year, in a day, or in an hour. The sea changed, the fields changed, the
rivers, the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon remained. Those
surfaces were neither so steep as to be destructible by weather, nor so
flat as to be the victims of floods and deposits. With the exception of
an aged highway, and a still more aged barrow presently to be referred
to--themselves almost crystallized to natural products by long
continuance--even the trifling irregularities were not caused by
pickaxe, plough, or spade, but remained as the very finger-touches of
the last geological change.

<p/>The above-mentioned highway traversed the lower levels of the heath,
from one horizon to another. In many portions of its course it overlaid
an old vicinal way, which branched from the great Western road of the
Romans, the Via Iceniana, or Ikenild Street, hard by. On the evening
under consideration it would have been noticed that, though the gloom
had increased sufficiently to confuse the minor features of the heath,
the white surface of the road remained almost as clear as ever.




<p/>2--Humanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble


<p/>Along the road walked an old man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was white-headed as a mountain,
bowed in the shoulders, and faded in general aspect. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a glazed
hat, an ancient boat-cloak, and shoes; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brass buttons bearing an
anchor upon their face. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand was a silver-headed walking stick,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used as a veritable third leg, perseveringly dotting the ground
with its point at every few inches' interval. One would have said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day, a naval officer of some sort or other.

<p/>Before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stretched the long, laborious road, dry, empty, and white.
It was quite open to the heath on each side, and bisected that vast dark
surface like the parting-line on a head of black hair, diminishing and
bending away on the furthest horizon.

<p/>The old man frequently stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes ahead to gaze over the tract
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had yet to traverse. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discerned, a long distance
in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), a moving spot, which appeared to be a vehicle, and
it proved to be going the same way as that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself was
journeying. It was the single atom of life that the scene contained, and
it only served to render the general loneliness more evident. Its rate
of advance was slow, and the old man gained upon it sensibly.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew nearer he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceived it to be a spring van, ordinary in
shape, but singular in colour, this being a lurid red. The driver walked
beside it; and, like his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) van, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was completely red. One dye of that
tincture covered his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) clothes, the cap upon his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) head, his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) boots, his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was not temporarily overlaid with the colour; it
permeated him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>).

<p/>The old man knew the meaning of this. The traveller with the cart was a
reddleman--a person whose vocation it was to supply farmers with redding
for their sheep. He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) was one of a class rapidly becoming extinct in
Wessex, filling at present in the rural world the place which, during
the last century, the dodo occupied in the world of animals. He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) is a
curious, interesting, and nearly perished link between obsolete forms of
life and those which generally prevail.

<p/>The decayed officer, by degrees, came up alongside his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) fellow-wayfarer,
and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) good evening. The reddleman turned his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) head, and replied
in sad and occupied tones. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was young, and his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) face, if not exactly
handsome, approached so near to handsome that nobody would have
contradicted an assertion that it really was so in its natural colour.
His (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) eye, which glared so strangely through his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) stain, was in itself
attractive--keen as that of a bird of prey, and blue as autumn mist. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
had neither whisker nor moustache, which allowed the soft curves of the
lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) face to be apparent. His (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) lips were thin, and though,
as it seemed, compressed by thought, there was a pleasant twitch at
their corners now and then. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was clothed throughout in a tight-fitting
suit of corduroy, excellent in quality, not much worn, and well-chosen
for its purpose, but deprived of its original colour by his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) trade. It
showed to advantage the good shape of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) figure. A certain well-to-do
air about the man suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was not poor for his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) degree.
The natural query of an observer would have been, Why should such
a promising being as this have hidden his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) prepossessing exterior by
adopting that singular occupation?

<p/>After replying to the old man's greeting he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) showed no inclination to
continue in talk, although they still walked side by side, for the elder
traveller seemed to desire company. There were no sounds but that of
the booming wind upon the stretch of tawny herbage around them, the
crackling wheels, the tread of the men, and the footsteps of the two
shaggy ponies which drew the van. They were small, hardy animals, of a
breed between Galloway and Exmoor, and were known as <div class="bookquote">``heath-croppers''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>here.

<p/>Now, as they thus pursued their way, the reddleman occasionally left his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
companion's side, and, stepping behind the van, looked into its interior
through a small window. The look was always anxious. He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) would then
return to the old man, who made another remark about the state of the
country and so on, to which the reddleman again abstractedly replied,
and then again they would lapse into silence. The silence conveyed to
neither any sense of awkwardness; in these lonely places wayfarers,
after a first greeting, frequently plod on for miles without speech;
contiguity amounts to a tacit conversation where, otherwise than in
cities, such contiguity can be put an end to on the merest inclination,
and where not to put an end to it is intercourse in itself.

<p/>Possibly these two might not have spoken again till their parting, had
it not been for the reddleman's visits to his (<font color='blue'><b>reddleman</b></font>) van. When he (<font color='blue'><b>reddleman</b></font>) returned
from his (<font color='blue'><b>reddleman</b></font>) fifth time of looking in the old man said, <div class="bookquote">``You have something
inside there besides your load?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Somebody who wants looking after?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Not long after this a faint cry sounded from the interior. The reddleman
hastened to the back, looked in, and came away again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a child there, my man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I have a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The deuce you have! Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cry out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has fallen asleep, and not being used to traveling, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s
uneasy, and keeps dreaming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A young woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would have interested me forty years ago. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s your
wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s above mating with such as I.
But there's no reason why I should tell you about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. And there's no reason why you should not. What harm can I
do to you or to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman looked in the old man's face. <div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said at
last, <div class="bookquote">``I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) before today, though perhaps it would have been better
if I had not. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s nothing to me, and I am nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
wouldn't have been in my van if any better carriage had been there to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where, may I ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Anglebury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know the town well. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doing there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not much--to gossip about. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s tired to death now, and
not at all well, and that's what makes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so restless. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dropped off
into a nap about an hour ago, and `twill do her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice-looking girl, no doubt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The traveller</b></font>)</div><p/>The other traveller turned his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) eyes with interest towards the van
window, and, without withdrawing them, said, <div class="bookquote">``I presume I might look in
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The traveller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``It is getting too dark for you to
see much of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and, more than that, I have no right to allow you.
Thank God she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeps so well, I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't wake till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? One of the neighbourhood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis no matter who, excuse me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that girl of Blooms-End, who has been talked about more or
less lately? If so, I know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and I can guess what has happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis no matter... Now, sir, I am sorry to say that we shall soon have
to part company. My ponies are tired, and I have further to go, and I am
going to rest them under this bank for an hour.''

<p/>The elder traveller nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) head indifferently, and the reddleman
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) horses and van in upon the turf, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Good night.''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>The
old man replied, and proceeded on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way as before.

<p/>The reddleman watched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) form as it diminished to a speck on the road
and became absorbed in the thickening films of night. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then took
some hay from a truss which was slung up under the van, and, throwing a
portion of it in front of the horses, made a pad of the rest, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
laid on the ground beside his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vehicle. Upon this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down, leaning
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back against the wheel. From the interior a low soft breathing came
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ear. It appeared to satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) musingly surveyed the
scene, as if considering the next step that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should take.

<p/>To do things musingly, and by small degrees, seemed, indeed, to be a
duty in the Egdon valleys at this transitional hour, for there was that
in the condition of the heath itself which resembled protracted and
halting dubiousness. It was the quality of the repose appertaining
to the scene. This was not the repose of actual stagnation, but the
apparent repose of incredible slowness. A condition of healthy life so
nearly resembling the torpor of death is a noticeable thing of its
sort; to exhibit the inertness of the desert, and at the same time to be
exercising powers akin to those of the meadow, and even of the forest,
awakened in those who thought of it the attentiveness usually engendered
by understatement and reserve.

<p/>The scene before the reddleman's eyes was a gradual series of ascents
from the level of the road backward into the heart of the heath. It
embraced hillocks, pits, ridges, acclivities, one behind the other, till
all was finished by a high hill cutting against the still light sky.
The traveller's eye hovered about these things for a time, and finally
settled upon one noteworthy object up there. It was a barrow. This bossy
projection of earth above its natural level occupied the loftiest ground
of the loneliest height that the heath contained. Although from the
vale it appeared but as a wart on an Atlantean brow, its actual bulk was
great. It formed the pole and axis of this heathery world.

<p/>As the resting man looked at the barrow he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became aware that its summit,
hitherto the highest object in the whole prospect round, was surmounted
by something higher. It rose from the semiglobular mound like a spike
from a helmet. The first instinct of an imaginative stranger might have
been to suppose it the person of one of the Celts who built the barrow,
so far had all of modern date withdrawn from the scene. It seemed a sort
of last man among them, musing for a moment before dropping into eternal
night with the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) race.

<p/>There the form stood, motionless as the hill beneath. Above the plain
rose the hill, above the hill rose the barrow, and above the barrow rose
the figure. Above the figure was nothing that could be mapped elsewhere
than on a celestial globe.

<p/>Such a perfect, delicate, and necessary finish did the figure give
to the dark pile of hills that it seemed to be the only obvious
justification of their outline. Without it, there was the dome without
the lantern; with it the architectural demands of the mass were
satisfied. The scene was strangely homogeneous, in that the vale, the
upland, the barrow, and the figure above it amounted only to unity.
Looking at this or that member of the group was not observing a complete
thing, but a fraction of a thing.

<p/>The form was so much like an organic part of the entire motionless
structure that to see it move would have impressed the mind as a strange
phenomenon. Immobility being the chief characteristic of that whole
which the person formed portion of, the discontinuance of immobility in
any quarter suggested confusion.

<p/>Yet that is what happened. The figure perceptibly gave up its fixity,
shifted a step or two, and turned round. As if alarmed, it descended on
the right side of the barrow, with the glide of a water-drop down a bud,
and then vanished. The movement had been sufficient to show more clearly
the characteristics of the figure, and that it was a woman's.

<p/>The reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sudden displacement now appeared. With her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dropping
out of sight on the right side, a newcomer, bearing a burden, protruded
into the sky on the left side, ascended the tumulus, and deposited the
burden on the top. A second followed, then a third, a fourth, a fifth,
and ultimately the whole barrow was peopled with burdened figures.

<p/>The only intelligible meaning in this sky-backed pantomime of
silhouettes was that the woman had no relation to the forms who had
taken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) place, was sedulously avoiding these, and had come thither
for another object than theirs. The imagination of the observer clung
by preference to that vanished, solitary figure, as to something more
interesting, more important, more likely to have a history worth knowing
than these newcomers, and unconsciously regarded them as intruders. But
they remained, and established themselves; and the lonely person who
hitherto had been queen of the solitude did not at present seem likely
to return.




<p/>3--The Custom of the Country


<p/>Had a looker-on been posted in the immediate vicinity of the barrow,
he (<font color='blue'><b>intruders</b></font>) would have learned that these persons were boys and men of the
neighbouring hamlets. Each, as he (<font color='blue'><b>intruders</b></font>) ascended the barrow, had been heavily
laden with furze faggots, carried upon the shoulder by means of a long
stake sharpened at each end for impaling them easily--two in front and
two behind. They came from a part of the heath a quarter of a mile to
the rear, where furze almost exclusively prevailed as a product.

<p/>Every individual was so involved in furze by his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) method of carrying the
faggots that he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) appeared like a bush on legs till he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) had thrown them
down. The party had marched in trail, like a travelling flock of sheep;
that is to say, the strongest first, the weak and young behind.

<p/>The loads were all laid together, and a pyramid of furze thirty feet in
circumference now occupied the crown of the tumulus, which was known as
Rainbarrow for many miles round. Some made themselves busy with matches,
and in selecting the driest tufts of furze, others in loosening the
bramble bonds which held the faggots together. Others, again, while this
was in progress, lifted their eyes and swept the vast expanse of country
commanded by their position, now lying nearly obliterated by shade. In
the valleys of the heath nothing save its own wild face was visible at
any time of day; but this spot commanded a horizon enclosing a tract of
far extent, and in many cases lying beyond the heath country. None of
its features could be seen now, but the whole made itself felt as a
vague stretch of remoteness.

<p/>While the men and lads were building the pile, a change took place in
the mass of shade which denoted the distant landscape. Red suns and
tufts of fire one by one began to arise, flecking the whole country
round. They were the bonfires of other parishes and hamlets that were
engaged in the same sort of commemoration. Some were distant, and stood
in a dense atmosphere, so that bundles of pale straw-like beams radiated
around them in the shape of a fan. Some were large and near, glowing
scarlet-red from the shade, like wounds in a black hide. Some were
Maenades, with winy faces and blown hair. These tinctured the silent
bosom of the clouds above them and lit up their ephemeral caves, which
seemed thenceforth to become scalding caldrons. Perhaps as many
as thirty bonfires could be counted within the whole bounds of the
district; and as the hour may be told on a clock-face when the figures
themselves are invisible, so did the men recognize the locality of each
fire by its angle and direction, though nothing of the scenery could be
viewed.

<p/>The first tall flame from Rainbarrow sprang into the sky, attracting all
eyes that had been fixed on the distant conflagrations back to their own
attempt in the same kind. The cheerful blaze streaked the inner surface
of the human circle--now increased by other stragglers, male and
female--with its own gold livery, and even overlaid the dark turf around
with a lively luminousness, which softened off into obscurity where the
barrow rounded downwards out of sight. It showed the barrow to be the
segment of a globe, as perfect as on the day when it was thrown up, even
the little ditch remaining from which the earth was dug. Not a plough
had ever disturbed a grain of that stubborn soil. In the heath's
barrenness to the farmer lay its fertility to the historian. There had
been no obliteration, because there had been no tending.

<p/>It seemed as if the bonfire-makers were standing in some radiant upper
story of the world, detached from and independent of the dark stretches
below. The heath down there was now a vast abyss, and no longer a
continuation of what they stood on; for their eyes, adapted to
the blaze, could see nothing of the deeps beyond its influence.
Occasionally, it is true, a more vigorous flare than usual from their
faggots sent darting lights like aides-de-camp down the inclines to some
distant bush, pool, or patch of white sand, kindling these to replies
of the same colour, till all was lost in darkness again. Then the whole
black phenomenon beneath represented Limbo as viewed from the brink by
the sublime Florentine in his (<font color='blue'><b>aides-de-camp</b></font>) vision, and the muttered articulations of
the wind in the hollows were as complaints and petitions from the <div class="bookquote">``souls
of mighty worth''  (<font color='red'><b>the Florentine</b></font>)</div>suspended therein.

<p/>It was as if these men and boys had suddenly dived into past ages, and
fetched therefrom an hour and deed which had before been familiar with
this spot. The ashes of the original British pyre which blazed from that
summit lay fresh and undisturbed in the barrow beneath their tread. The
flames from funeral piles long ago kindled there had shone down upon the
lowlands as these were shining now. Festival fires to Thor and Woden had
followed on the same ground and duly had their day. Indeed, it is pretty
well known that such blazes as this the heathmen were now enjoying are
rather the lineal descendants from jumbled Druidical rites and Saxon
ceremonies than the invention of popular feeling about Gunpowder Plot.

<p/>Moreover to light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of man
when, at the winter ingress, the curfew is sounded throughout Nature.
It indicates a spontaneous, Promethean rebelliousness against that fiat
that this recurrent season shall bring foul times, cold darkness, misery
and death. Black chaos comes, and the fettered gods of the earth say,
Let there be light.

<p/>The brilliant lights and sooty shades which struggled upon the skin
and clothes of the persons standing round caused their lineaments and
general contours to be drawn with Dureresque vigour and dash. Yet the
permanent moral expression of each face it was impossible to discover,
for as the nimble flames towered, nodded, and swooped through the
surrounding air, the blots of shade and flakes of light upon the
countenances of the group changed shape and position endlessly. All
was unstable; quivering as leaves, evanescent as lightning. Shadowy
eye-sockets, deep as those of a death's head, suddenly turned into pits
of lustre: a lantern-jaw was cavernous, then it was shining; wrinkles
were emphasized to ravines, or obliterated entirely by a changed ray.
Nostrils were dark wells; sinews in old necks were gilt mouldings;
things with no particular polish on them were glazed; bright objects,
such as the tip of a furze-hook one of the men carried, were as glass;
eyeballs glowed like little lanterns. Those whom Nature had depicted as
merely quaint became grotesque, the grotesque became preternatural; for
all was in extremity.

<p/>Hence it may be that the face of an old man, who had like others been
called to the heights by the rising flames, was not really the mere nose
and chin that it appeared to be, but an appreciable quantity of human
countenance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood complacently sunning himself in the heat. With
a speaker, or stake, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tossed the outlying scraps of fuel into the
conflagration, looking at the midst of the pile, occasionally lifting
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes to measure the height of the flame, or to follow the great
sparks which rose with it and sailed away into darkness. The beaming
sight, and the penetrating warmth, seemed to breed in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a cumulative
cheerfulness, which soon amounted to delight. With his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to jig a private minuet, a bunch of copper seals shining and
swinging like a pendulum from under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waistcoat: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also began to
sing, in the voice of a bee up a flue--

<p/>``The king' call'd down' his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) no-bles all',
By one', by two', by three';
Earl Mar'-shal, I'll' go shrive'-the queen',
And thou' shalt wend' with me'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A boon', a boon', quoth Earl' Mar-shal',
And fell' on his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) bend'-ded knee',
That what'-so-e'er' the queen' shall say',
No harm' there-of' may be'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Want of breath prevented a continuance of the song; and the breakdown
attracted the attention of a firm-standing man of middle age, who kept
each corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crescent-shaped mouth rigorously drawn back into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cheek, as if to do away with any suspicion of mirthfulness which might
erroneously have attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fair stave, Grandfer Cantle; but I am afeard `tis too much for
the mouldy weasand of such a old man as you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to the wrinkled
reveller. <div class="bookquote">``Dostn't wish th' wast three sixes again, Grandfer, as you was

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, stopping in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dance.

 (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>the other inquired, pointing towards a dim light in the direction of the
distant highway, but considerably apart from where the reddleman was
at that moment resting. <div class="bookquote">``What's the rights of the matter about `em? You
ought to know, being an understanding man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But a little rakish, hey? I own to it. Master Cantle is that, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)'s
nothing. Yet `tis a gay fault, neigbbour Fairway, that age will cure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard that they were coming home tonight. By this time they must have

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The next thing is for us to go and wish `em joy, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no.''

<p/>I met Mis'ess Yeobright, the young bride's aunt, last night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
told me that her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) son Clym was coming home a' Christmas. Wonderful
clever, `a believe--ah, I should like to have all that's under that
young man's hair. Well, then, I spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) in my well-known merry
way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, `O that what's shaped so venerable should talk like a
fool!'--that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said to me. I don't care for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), be jowned if I
do, and so I told her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). `Be jowned if I care for `ee,' I said. I had her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
there--hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather think she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance slightly flagging. ```Tisn't
so bad as that with me?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seemingly `tis, however, is it because of the wedding that Clym is
coming home a' Christmas--to make a new arrangement because his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) mother
is now left in the house alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes--that's it. But, Timothy, hearken to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Grandfer
earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``Though known as such a joker, I be an understanding man if
you catch me serious, and I am serious now. I can tell `ee lots about
the married couple. Yes, this morning at six o’clock they went up the
country to do the job, and neither vell nor mark have been seen of `em
since, though I reckon that this afternoon has brought `em home again
man and woman--wife, that is. Isn't it spoke like a man, Timothy, and
wasn't Mis'ess Yeobright wrong about me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it will do. I didn't know the two had walked together since last
fall, when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aunt forbad the banns. How long has this new set-to been

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, how long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle smartly, likewise turning to
Humphrey. <div class="bookquote">``I ask that question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aunt altered her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have the man
after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>replied Humphrey, without removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) eyes from the fire.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was a somewhat solemn young fellow, and carried the hook and leather
gloves of a furze-cutter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) legs, by reason of that occupation, being
sheathed in bulging leggings as stiff as the Philistine's greaves of
brass. <div class="bookquote">``That's why they went away to be married, I count. You see, after
kicking up such a nunny-watch and forbidding the banns `twould have made
Mis'ess Yeobright seem foolish-like to have a banging wedding in the
same parish all as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d never gainsaid it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly--seem foolish-like; and that's very bad for the poor things
that be so, though I only guess as much, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer
Cantle, still strenuously preserving a sensible bearing and mien.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, I was at church that day,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway, <div class="bookquote">``which was a very
curious thing to happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If `twasn't my name's Simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Grandfer emphatically. <div class="bookquote">``I
ha’n’t been there to-year; and now the winter is a-coming on I won't say
I shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ha’n’t been these three years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey; <div class="bookquote">``for I'm so dead
sleepy of a Sunday; and `tis so terrible far to get there; and when you
do get there `tis such a mortal poor chance that you'll be chose for up

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I not only happened to be there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway, with a fresh collection
of emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``but I was sitting in the same pew as Mis'ess Yeobright.
And though you may not see it as such, it fairly made my blood run cold
to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). Yes, it is a curious thing; but it made my blood run
cold, for I was close at her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) elbow.''  (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div>The speaker looked round upon
the bystanders, now drawing closer to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) lips gathered
tighter than ever in the rigorousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) descriptive moderation.

<p/>```Tis a serious job to have things happen to `ee there,'' said a woman
behind.

<p/>```Ye are to declare it,' was the parson's words,'' Fairway continued.
<div class="bookquote">``And then up stood a woman at my side--a-touching of me. `Well, be
damned if there isn't Mis'ess Yeobright a-standing up,' I said to
myself. Yes, neighbours, though I was in the temple of prayer that's
what I said. `Tis against my conscience to curse and swear in company,
and I hope any woman here will overlook it. Still what I did say I did
say, and `twould be a lie if I didn't own it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So `twould, neighbour Fairway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>```Be damned if there isn't Mis'ess Yeobright a-standing up,' I said,''
the narrator repeated, giving out the bad word with the same passionless
severity of face as before, which proved how entirely necessity and not
gusto had to do with the iteration. ``And the next thing I heard was, `I
forbid the banns,' from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). `I'll speak to you after the service,'
said the parson, in quite a homely way--yes, turning all at once into a
common man no holier than you or I. Ah, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face was pale! Maybe you
can call to mind that monument in Weatherbury church--the cross-legged
soldier that have had his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) arm knocked away by the schoolchildren? Well,
he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) would about have matched that woman's face, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, `I forbid
the banns.'''

<p/>The audience cleared their throats and tossed a few stalks into the
fire, not because these deeds were urgent, but to give themselves time
to weigh the moral of the story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure when I heard they'd been forbid I felt as glad as if anybody
had gied me sixpence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olly Dowden/Olly/Dowden</b></font>)</div>said an earnest voice--that of Olly Dowden, a
woman who lived by making heath brooms, or besoms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nature was to be
civil to enemies as well as to friends, and grateful to all the world
for letting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remain alive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now the maid have married him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) just the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After that Mis'ess Yeobright came round and was quite agreeable,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>Fairway resumed, with an unheeding air, to show that his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) words were no
appendage to Humphrey's, but the result of independent reflection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Supposing they were ashamed, I don't see why they shouldn't have done
it here-right,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman stays</b></font>)</div>said a wide-spread woman whose stays creaked like
shoes whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stooped or turned. ```Tis well to call the neighbours
together and to hae a good racket once now and then; and it may as
well be when there's a wedding as at tide-times. I don't care for close
ways.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, now, you'd hardly believe it, but I don't care for gay weddings,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div>said Timothy Fairway, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) eyes again travelling round. <div class="bookquote">``I hardly blame
Thomasin Yeobright and neighbour Wildeve for doing it quiet, if I must
own it. A wedding at home means five and six-handed reels by the hour;
and they do a man's legs no good when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s over forty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True. Once at the woman's house you can hardly say nay to being one in
a jig, knowing all the time that you be expected to make yourself worth
your victuals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You be bound to dance at Christmas because `tis the time o' year; you
must dance at weddings because `tis the time o' life. At christenings
folk will even smuggle in a reel or two, if `tis no further on than the
first or second chiel. And this is not naming the songs you've got to
sing... For my part I like a good hearty funeral as well as anything.
You've as splendid victuals and drink as at other parties, and even
better. And it don't wear your legs to stumps in talking over a poor
fellow's ways as it do to stand up in hornpipes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine folks out of ten would own `twas going too far to dance then, I
suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested Grandfer Cantle.

<p/>```Tis the only sort of party a staid man can feel safe at after the mug
have been round a few times.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I can't understand a quiet ladylike little body like Tamsin
Yeobright caring to be married in such a mean way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div>said Susan Nunsuch,
the wide woman, who preferred the original subject. ```Tis worse than the
poorest do. And I shouldn't have cared about the man, though some may
say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s good-looking.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To give him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) due he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a clever, learned fellow in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) way--a'most as
clever as Clym Yeobright used to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was brought up to better things
than keeping the Quiet Woman. An engineer--that's what the man was, as
we know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw away his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chance, and so `a took a public house to
live. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learning was no use to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very often the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olly Dowden/Olly/Dowden</b></font>)</div>said Olly, the besom-maker. <div class="bookquote">``And yet how people

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True--`tis amazing what a polish the world have been brought to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said
Humphrey.

gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) throat a thorough rake round, as if it were the duty of every
person not to be mistaken through thickness of voice. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I knew of
such a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what ghastly gallicrow might the poor fellow have been like, Master
Fairway?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the turf-cutter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `a was neither a deaf man, nor a dumb man, nor a blind man. What
`a was I don't say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) known in these parts?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olly Dowden/Olly/Dowden</b></font>)</div>said Olly Dowden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div>said Timothy; <div class="bookquote">``but I name no name... Come, keep the fire up
there, youngsters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever is Christian Cantle's teeth a-chattering for?''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>said a boy from
amid the smoke and shades on the other side of the blaze. <div class="bookquote">``Be ye a-cold,
Christian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A thin jibbering voice was heard to reply, <div class="bookquote">``No, not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come forward, Christian, and show yourself. I didn't know you were
here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway, with a humane look across towards that quarter.

<p/>Thus requested, a faltering man, with reedy hair, no shoulders, and a
great quantity of wrist and ankle beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes, advanced a step or
two by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own will, and was pushed by the will of others half a dozen
steps more. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Grandfer Cantle's youngest son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What be ye quaking for, Christian?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the turf-cutter kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm the man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man no woman will marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The deuce you be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div>said Timothy Fairway, enlarging his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) gaze to cover
Christian's whole surface and a great deal more, Grandfer Cantle
meanwhile staring as a hen stares at the duck she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) has hatched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I be he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and it makes me afeard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian. <div class="bookquote">``D’ye think

I do care all the while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, be damned if this isn't the queerest start ever I know'd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean you at all. There's another in the country,
then! Why did ye reveal yer misfortune, Christian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twas to be if `twas, I suppose. I can't help it, can I?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) turned
upon them his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) painfully circular eyes, surrounded by concentric lines
like targets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that's true. But `tis a melancholy thing, and my blood ran cold
when you spoke, for I felt there were two poor fellows where I had
thought only one. `Tis a sad thing for ye, Christian. How'st know the
women won't hae thee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've asked `em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure I should never have thought you had the face. Well, and what did

all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>maphrotight fool</b></font>)</div><p/>```Get out of my sight, you slack-twisted, slim-looking maphrotight

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not encouraging, I own,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. ```Get out of my sight, you
slack-twisted, slim-looking maphrotight fool,' is rather a hard way of
saying No. But even that might be overcome by time and patience, so as
to let a few grey hairs show themselves in the hussy's head. How old be
you, Christian?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty-one last tatie-digging, Mister Fairway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a boy--not a boy. Still there's hope yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my age by baptism, because that's put down in the great book of
the Judgment that they keep in church vestry; but Mother told me I was
born some time afore I was christened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) couldn't tell when, to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) life, except that there was no

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No moon--that's bad. Hey, neighbours, that's bad for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, `tis bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother know'd `twas no moon, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) asked another woman that had
an almanac, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) did whenever a boy was born to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), because of the
saying, `No moon, no man,' which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) afeard every man-child she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
had. Do ye really think it serious, Mister Fairway, that there was no
moon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. `No moon, no man.' `Tis one of the truest sayings ever spit out.
The boy never comes to anything that's born at new moon. A bad job for
thee, Christian, that you should have showed your nose then of all days
in the month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose the moon was terrible full when you were born?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said
Christian, with a look of hopeless admiration at Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `a was not new,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fairway</b></font>)</div>Mr. Fairway replied, with a disinterested gaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner go without drink at Lammas-tide than be a man of no moon,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>continued Christian, in the same shattered recitative. ```Tis said I be
only the rames of a man, and no good for my race at all; and I suppose
that's the cause o't.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, somewhat subdued in spirit; <div class="bookquote">``and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)

outgrow hisself and go for a soldier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's many just as bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wethers must live their time as well as other sheep, poor soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So perhaps I shall rub on? Ought I to be afeared o' nights, Master
Fairway?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to lie alone all your life; and `tis not to married couples

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--don't talk about it if `tis agreeable of ye not to! `Twill make my

What sort of a spirit did ye mean when ye said, a very strange one,
Timothy?--no, no--don't tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't half believe in spirits myself. But I think it ghostly

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it like?--no, don't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A red one. Yes, most ghosts be white; but this is as if it had been
dipped in blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Christian drew a deep breath without letting it expand his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body, and
Humphrey said, <div class="bookquote">``Where has it been seen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly here; but in this same heth. But `tisn't a thing to talk
about. What do ye say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Fairway in brisker tones, and turning
upon them as if the idea had not been Grandfer Cantle's--<div class="bookquote">``what do you
say to giving the new man and wife a bit of a song tonight afore we go
to bed--being their wedding-day? When folks are just married `tis as
well to look glad o't, since looking sorry won't unjoin `em. I am no
drinker, as we know, but when the womenfolk and youngsters have gone
home we can drop down across to the Quiet Woman, and strike up a ballet
in front of the married folks' door. `Twill please the young wife, and
that's what I should like to do, for many's the skinful I've had at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
hands when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aunt at Blooms-End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey? And so we will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, turning so briskly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)
copper seals swung extravagantly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm as dry as a kex with biding up
here in the wind, and I haven't seen the colour of drink since
nammet-time today. `Tis said that the last brew at the Woman is very
pretty drinking. And, neighbours, if we should be a little late in the
finishing, why, tomorrow's Sunday, and we can sleep it off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandfer Cantle! you take things very careless for an old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said
the wide woman.

<p/>``I take things careless; I do--too careless to please the women! Klk!
I'll sing the `Jovial Crew,' or any other song, when a weak old man
would cry his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes out. Jown it; I am up for anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The king' look'd o'-ver his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left' shoul-der',

Or hang'-ed thou' shouldst bee'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's what we'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``We'll give `em a song, an'

home after the deed's done? He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should have come afore, if so be he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
wanted to stop it, and marry her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s coming to bide with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mother a little time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must
feel lonely now the maid's gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, `tis very odd, but I never feel lonely--no, not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said
Grandfer Cantle. <div class="bookquote">``I am as brave in the nighttime as a' admiral!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bonfire was by this time beginning to sink low, for the fuel had not
been of that substantial sort which can support a blaze long. Most
of the other fires within the wide horizon were also dwindling weak.
Attentive observation of their brightness, colour, and length of
existence would have revealed the quality of the material burnt, and
through that, to some extent the natural produce of the district in
which each bonfire was situate. The clear, kingly effulgence that had
characterized the majority expressed a heath and furze country like
their own, which in one direction extended an unlimited number of miles;
the rapid flares and extinctions at other points of the compass showed
the lightest of fuel--straw, beanstalks, and the usual waste from
arable land. The most enduring of all--steady unaltering eyes like
Planets--signified wood, such as hazel-branches, thorn-faggots, and
stout billets. Fires of the last-mentioned materials were rare, and
though comparatively small in magnitude beside the transient blazes, now
began to get the best of them by mere long continuance. The great ones
had perished, but these remained. They occupied the remotest visible
positions--sky-backed summits rising out of rich coppice and plantation
districts to the north, where the soil was different, and heath foreign
and strange.

<p/>Save one; and this was the nearest of any, the moon of the whole shining
throng. It lay in a direction precisely opposite to that of the little
window in the vale below. Its nearness was such that, notwithstanding
its actual smallness, its glow infinitely transcended theirs.

<p/>This quiet eye had attracted attention from time to time; and when their
own fire had become sunken and dim it attracted more; some even of
the wood fires more recently lighted had reached their decline, but no
change was perceptible here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, how near that fire is!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``Seemingly. I can see
a fellow of some sort walking round it. Little and good must be said of
that fire, surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can throw a stone there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so can I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, you can't, my sonnies. That fire is not much less than a mile
off, for all that `a seems so near.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis in the heath, but no furze,'' said the turf-cutter.

<p/>```Tis cleft-wood, that's what `tis,'' said Timothy Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing
would burn like that except clean timber. And `tis on the knap afore the
old captain's house at Mistover. Such a queer mortal as that man is! To
have a little fire inside your own bank and ditch, that nobody else may
enjoy it or come anigh it! And what a zany an old chap must be, to light
a bonfire when there's no youngsters to please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cap’n Vye has been for a long walk today, and is quite tired out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said
Grandfer Cantle, <div class="bookquote">``so `tisn't likely to be he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) would hardly afford good fuel like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the wide woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it must be his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) granddaughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``Not that a body of
her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) age can want a fire much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) is very strange in her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) ways, living up there by herself, and such
things please her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>)'s a well-favoured maid enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey the furze-cutter,
<div class="bookquote">``especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>)'s got one of her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) dandy gowns on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``Well, let her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) bonfire burn an't will. Ours
is well-nigh out by the look o't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dark `tis now the fire's gone down!''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian Cantle,
looking behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) hare eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Don't ye think we'd better get
home-along, neighbours? The heth isn't haunted, I know; but we'd better
get home... Ah, what was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only the wind,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the turf-cutter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think Fifth-of-Novembers ought to be kept up by night except in
towns. It should be by day in outstep, ill-accounted places like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Christian. Lift up your spirits like a man! Susy, dear, you
and I will have a jig--hey, my honey?--before `tis quite too dark to see
how well-favoured you be still, though so many summers have passed since
your husband, a son of a witch, snapped you up from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div><p/>This was addressed to Susan Nunsuch; and the next circumstance of which
the beholders were conscious was a vision of the matron's broad form
whisking off towards the space whereon the fire had been kindled. She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
was lifted bodily by Mr. Fairway's arm, which had been flung round her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
waist before she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) had become aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) intention. The site of the fire
was now merely a circle of ashes flecked with red embers and sparks, the
furze having burnt completely away. Once within the circle he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) whirled
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) round and round in a dance. She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was a woman noisily constructed;
in addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) enclosing framework of whalebone and lath, she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) wore
pattens summer and winter, in wet weather and in dry, to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
boots from wear; and when Fairway began to jump about with her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), the
clicking of the pattens, the creaking of the stays, and her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) screams of
surprise, formed a very audible concert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll crack thy numskull for thee, you mandy chap!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Nunsuch</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Nunsuch,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) helplessly danced round with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) feet playing like
drumsticks among the sparks. <div class="bookquote">``My ankles were all in a fever before, from
walking through that prickly furze, and now you must make `em worse with
these vlankers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div><p/>The vagary of Timothy Fairway was infectious. The turf-cutter seized old
Olly Dowden, and, somewhat more gently, poussetted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) likewise.
The young men were not slow to imitate the example of their elders, and
seized the maids; Grandfer Cantle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dowden</b></font>) stick jigged in the form of a
three-legged object among the rest; and in half a minute all that could
be seen on Rainbarrow was a whirling of dark shapes amid a boiling
confusion of sparks, which leapt around the dancers as high as their
waists. The chief noises were women's shrill cries, men's laughter,
Susan's stays and pattens, Olly Dowden's <div class="bookquote">``heu-heu-heu!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olly Dowden/Olly/Dowden</b></font>)</div>and the
strumming of the wind upon the furze-bushes, which formed a kind of tune
to the demoniac measure they trod. Christian alone stood aloof, uneasily
rocking himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``They ought not to do it--how the
vlankers do fly! `tis tempting the Wicked one, `tis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lads</b></font>)</div>said one of the lads, stopping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian, hastily closing up to the rest.

<p/>The dancers all lessened their speed.

<p/>```Twas behind you, Christian, that I heard it--down here.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--`tis behind me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>Christian said. <div class="bookquote">``Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
bless the bed that I lie on; four angels guard--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue. What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hoi-i-i-i!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloo-o-o-o!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any cart track up across here to Mis'ess Yeobright's, of
Blooms-End?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came to them in the same voice, as a long, slim indistinct
figure approached the barrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought we not to run home as hard as we can, neighbours, as `tis getting
late?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian. <div class="bookquote">``Not run away from one another, you know; run
close together, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scrape up a few stray locks of furze, and make a blaze, so that we can
see who the man is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/>When the flame arose it revealed a young man in tight raiment, and red
from top to toe. <div class="bookquote">``Is there a track across here to Mis'ess Yeobright's
house?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay--keep along the path down there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean a way two horses and a van can travel over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; you can get up the vale below here with time. The track is
rough, but if you've got a light your horses may pick along wi' care.
Have ye brought your cart far up, neighbour reddleman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've left it in the bottom, about half a mile back, I stepped on in
front to make sure of the way, as `tis night-time, and I han't been here
for so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well you can get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``What a turn it did give me
when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) added to the whole group, the reddleman included.
<div class="bookquote">``Lord's sake, I thought, whatever fiery mommet is this come to trouble
us? No slight to your looks, reddleman, for ye bain't bad-looking in the

boy told of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It gied me a turn likewise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div>said Susan Nunsuch, <div class="bookquote">``for I had a dream
last night of a death's head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ye talk o't no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had a handkerchief
over his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'d look for all the world like the Devil in the picture

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, thank you for telling me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the young reddleman, smiling
faintly. <div class="bookquote">``And good night t'ye all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) withdrew from their sight down the barrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy I've seen that young man's face before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey. <div class="bookquote">``But
where, or how, or what his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name is, I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman had not been gone more than a few minutes when another
person approached the partially revived bonfire. It proved to be a
well-known and respected widow of the neighbourhood, of a standing which
can only be expressed by the word genteel. Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) face, encompassed by
the blackness of the receding heath, showed whitely, and with-out
half-lights, like a cameo.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was a woman of middle-age, with well-formed features of the type
usually found where perspicacity is the chief quality enthroned within.
At moments she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) seemed to be regarding issues from a Nebo denied to
others around. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had something of an estranged mien; the solitude
exhaled from the heath was concentrated in this face that had risen from
it. The air with which she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) looked at the heathmen betokened a certain
unconcern at their presence, or at what might be their opinions of
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) for walking in that lonely spot at such an hour, thus indirectly
implying that in some respect or other they were not up to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) level.
The explanation lay in the fact that though her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) husband had been a small
farmer she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) herself was a curate's daughter, who had once dreamt of doing
better things.

<p/>Persons with any weight of character carry, like planets, their
atmospheres along with them in their orbits; and the matron who entered
now upon the scene could, and usually did, bring her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) own tone into a
company. Her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) normal manner among the heathfolk had that reticence which
results from the consciousness of superior communicative power. But
the effect of coming into society and light after lonely wandering in
darkness is a sociability in the comer above its usual pitch, expressed
in the features even more than in words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis Mis'ess Yeobright,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``Mis'ess Yeobright, not ten
minutes ago a man was here asking for you--a reddleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) want?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't tell us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something to sell, I suppose; what it can be I am at a loss to
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear that your son Mr. Clym is coming home at Christmas,
ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, the turf-cutter. <div class="bookquote">``What a dog he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) used to be for
bonfires!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) must be a fine fellow by this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is a man now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) replied quietly.

<p/>```Tis very lonesome for `ee in the heth tonight, mis'ess,'' said
Christian, coming from the seclusion he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had hitherto maintained. <div class="bookquote">``Mind
you don't get lost. Egdon Heth is a bad place to get lost in, and the
winds do huffle queerer tonight than ever I heard `em afore. Them that
know Egdon best have been pixy-led here at times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Christian?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``What made you hide away
from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twas that I didn't know you in this light, mis'ess; and being a man of
the mournfullest make, I was scared a little, that's all. Oftentimes if
you could see how terrible down I get in my mind, `twould make `ee quite
nervous for fear I should die by my hand.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't take after your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright, looking towards
the fire, where Grandfer Cantle, with some want of originality, was
dancing by himself among the sparks, as the others had done before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Grandfer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div>said Timothy Fairway, <div class="bookquote">``we are ashamed of ye. A reverent
old patriarch man as you be--seventy if a day--to go hornpiping like
that by yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A harrowing old man, Mis'ess Yeobright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>said Christian despondingly.
<div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't live with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a week, so playward as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, if I could get
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mis ess Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twould be more seemly in ye to stand still and welcome Mis'ess
Yeobright, and you the venerablest here, Grandfer Cantle,'' said the
besom-woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, and so it would,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reveller</b></font>)</div>said the reveller checking himself
repentantly. <div class="bookquote">``I've such a bad memory, Mis'ess Yeobright, that I forget
how I'm looked up to by the rest of `em. My spirits must be wonderful
good, you'll say? But not always. `Tis a weight upon a man to be looked
up to as commander, and I often feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to stop the talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``But I must be
leaving you now. I was passing down the Anglebury Road, towards my
niece's new home, who is returning tonight with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) husband; and seeing
the bonfire and hearing Olly's voice among the rest I came up here to
learn what was going on. I should like her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to walk with me, as her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) way
is mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sure, ma’am, I'm just thinking of moving,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olly Dowden/Olly/Dowden</b></font>)</div>said Olly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you'll be safe to meet the reddleman that I told ye of,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>)'s only gone back to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>) van. We heard that your niece
and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) husband were coming straight home as soon as they were married,
and we are going down there shortly, to give `em a song o' welcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we shall take a shorter cut through the furze than you can go with
long clothes; so we won't trouble you to wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--are you ready, Olly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am. And there's a light shining from your niece's window, see.
It will help to keep us in the path.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) indicated the faint light at the bottom of the valley which Fairway
had pointed out; and the two women descended the tumulus.




<p/>4--The Halt on the Turnpike Road


<p/>Down, downward they went, and yet further down--their descent at each
step seeming to outmeasure their advance. Their skirts were scratched
noisily by the furze, their shoulders brushed by the ferns, which,
though dead and dry, stood erect as when alive, no sufficient winter
weather having as yet arrived to beat them down. Their Tartarean
situation might by some have been called an imprudent one for two
unattended women. But these shaggy recesses were at all seasons a
familiar surrounding to Olly and Mrs. Yeobright; and the addition of
darkness lends no frightfulness to the face of a friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so Tamsin has married him (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>) at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olly Dowden/Olly/Dowden</b></font>)</div>said Olly, when the incline
had become so much less steep that their foot-steps no longer required
undivided attention.

<p/>Mrs. Yeobright answered slowly, <div class="bookquote">``Yes; at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How you will miss her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)--living with `ee as a daughter, as she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) always
have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do miss her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olly Dowden/Olly/Dowden</b></font>)</div><p/>Olly, though without the tact to perceive when remarks were untimely,
was saved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) very simplicity from rendering them offensive.
Questions that would have been resented in others she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could ask with
impunity. This accounted for Mrs. Yeobright's acquiescence in the
revival of an evidently sore subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was quite strook to hear you'd agreed to it, ma’am, that I was,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the besom-maker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were not more struck by it than I should have been last year this
time, Olly. There are a good many sides to that wedding. I could not
tell you all of them, even if I tried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt myself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>) was hardly solid-going enough to mate with your
family. Keeping an inn--what is it? But `a's clever, that's true, and
they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>) was an engineering gentleman once, but has come down by
being too outwardly given.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw that, upon the whole, it would be better she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should marry where
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little thing, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feelings got the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), no doubt. `Tis
nature. Well, they may call him (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>) what they will--he (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>)'ve several acres
of heth-ground broke up here, besides the public house, and the
heth-croppers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>) manners be quite like a gentleman's. And what's
done cannot be undone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``See, here's the wagon-track at last.
Now we shall get along better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The wedding subject was no further dwelt upon; and soon a faint
diverging path was reached, where they parted company, Olly first
begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) companion to remind Mr. Wildeve that he (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>) had not sent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) sick husband the bottle of wine promised on the occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Olly</b></font>)
marriage. The besom-maker turned to the left towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) own house,
behind a spur of the hill, and Mrs. Yeobright followed the straight
track, which further on joined the highway by the Quiet Woman Inn,
whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) niece to have returned with Wildeve from their
wedding at Anglebury that day.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) first reached Wildeve's Patch, as it was called, a plot of land
redeemed from the heath, and after long and laborious years brought into
cultivation. The man who had discovered that it could be tilled died of
the labour; the man who succeeded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in possession ruined himself in
fertilizing it. Wildeve came like Amerigo Vespucci, and received the
honours due to those who had gone before.

<p/>When Mrs. Yeobright had drawn near to the inn, and was about to enter,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) saw a horse and vehicle some two hundred yards beyond it, coming
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), a man walking alongside with a lantern in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. It
was soon evident that this was the reddleman who had inquired for her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>).
Instead of entering the inn at once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) walked by it and towards the
van.

<p/>The conveyance came close, and the man was about to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) with
little notice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``I think you have been
inquiring for me? I am Mrs. Yeobright of Blooms-End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman started, and held up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped the horses,
and beckoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) to withdraw with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a few yards aside, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
did, wondering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know me, ma’am, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, I do! You are young Venn--your father
was a dairyman somewhere here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and I knew your niece, Miss Tamsin, a little. I have something bad
to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)--no! She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) has just come home, I believe, with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) husband.
They arranged to return this afternoon--to the inn beyond here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)'s not there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)'s here. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)'s in my van,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What new trouble has come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Yeobright, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) hand
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>``I can't explain much, ma’am. All I know is that, as I was going along
the road this morning, about a mile out of Anglebury, I heard something
trotting after me like a doe, and looking round there she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was, white as
death itself. `Oh, Diggory Venn!' she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) said, `I thought `twas you--will
you help me? I am in trouble.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) know your Christian name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright doubtingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had met her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) as a lad before I went away in this trade. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) asked then
if she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) might ride, and then down she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) fell in a faint. I picked her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) up
and put her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) in, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) has been ever since. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) has cried a good
deal, but she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) has hardly spoke; all she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) has told me being that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was
to have been married this morning. I tried to get her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to eat something,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) couldn't; and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) fell asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright, hastening towards the
van.

<p/>The reddleman followed with the lantern, and, stepping up first,
assisted Mrs. Yeobright to mount beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). On the door being opened
she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) perceived at the end of the van an extemporized couch, around which
was hung apparently all the drapery that the reddleman possessed,
to keep the occupant of the little couch from contact with the red
materials of his (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) trade. A young girl lay thereon, covered with a cloak.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was asleep, and the light of the lantern fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) features.

<p/>A fair, sweet, and honest country face was revealed, reposing in a nest
of wavy chestnut hair. It was between pretty and beautiful. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
eyes were closed, one could easily imagine the light necessarily shining
in them as the culmination of the luminous workmanship around. The
groundwork of the face was hopefulness; but over it now I ay like a
foreign substance a film of anxiety and grief. The grief had been there
so shortly as to have abstracted nothing of the bloom, and had as yet
but given a dignity to what it might eventually undermine. The scarlet
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips had not had time to abate, and just now it appeared still
more intense by the absence of the neighbouring and more transient
colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheek. The lips frequently parted, with a murmur of words.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to belong rightly to a madrigal--to require viewing through
rhyme and harmony.

<p/>One thing at least was obvious: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not made to be looked at
thus. The reddleman had appeared conscious of as much, and, while Mrs.
Yeobright looked in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cast his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes aside with a delicacy
which well became him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). The sleeper apparently thought so too, for the
next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) own.

<p/>The lips then parted with something of anticipation, something more of
doubt; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) several thoughts and fractions of thoughts, as signalled
by the changes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face, were exhibited by the light to the utmost
nicety. An ingenuous, transparent life was disclosed, as if the flow of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) existence could be seen passing within her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) understood the scene
in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, it is I, Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I know how frightened you are, and
how you cannot believe it; but all the same, it is I who have come home
like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tamsin, Tamsin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright, stooping over the young woman and
kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``O my dear girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin was now on the verge of a sob, but by an unexpected
self-command she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) uttered no sound. With a gentle panting breath she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) sat
upright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not expect to see you in this state, any more than you me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
went on quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Where am I, Aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly home, my dear. In Egdon Bottom. What dreadful thing is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you in a moment. So near, are we? Then I will get out and
walk. I want to go home by the path.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you
right on to my house?''  (<font color='red'><b>the aunt</b></font>)</div>said the aunt, turning to the reddleman, who had
withdrawn from the front of the van on the awakening of the girl, and
stood in the road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you think it necessary to ask me? I will, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is indeed kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>murmured Thomasin. <div class="bookquote">``I was once acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
Aunt, and when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) today I thought I should prefer his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) van to any
conveyance of a stranger. But I'll walk now. Reddleman, stop the horses,
please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with tender reluctance, but stopped them

<p/>Aunt and niece then descended from the van, Mrs. Yeobright saying to its
owner, <div class="bookquote">``I quite recognize you now. What made you change from the nice
business your father left you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>owner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) said, and looked at Thomasin, who blushed a little.
<div class="bookquote">``Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma’am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright glanced around at the dark sky, at the hills, at the
perishing bonfires, and at the lighted window of the inn they had
neared. <div class="bookquote">``I think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``since Thomasin wishes to walk. We can
soon run up the path and reach home--we know it well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And after a few further words they parted, the reddleman moving onwards
with his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) van, and the two women remaining standing in the road. As soon
as the vehicle and its driver had withdrawn so far as to be beyond all
possible reach of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) voice, Mrs. Yeobright turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Thomasin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said sternly, <div class="bookquote">``what's the meaning of this
disgraceful performance?''




 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>5--Perplexity among Honest People


<p/>Thomasin looked as if quite overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt's change of manner.
<div class="bookquote">``It means just what it seems to mean: I am--not married,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) replied
faintly. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me--for humiliating you, Aunt, by this mishap--I am
sorry for it. But I cannot help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me? Think of yourself first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was nobody's fault. When we got there the parson wouldn't marry us

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What irregularity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Mr. Wildeve can explain. I did not think when I went away
this morning that I should come back like this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>It being dark, Thomasin
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) emotion to escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) by the silent way of tears, which
could roll down her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) cheek unseen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could almost say that it serves you right--if I did not feel that
you don't deserve it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Yeobright, who, possessing two
distinct moods in close contiguity, a gentle mood and an angry, flew
from one to the other without the least warning. <div class="bookquote">``Remember, Thomasin,
this business was none of my seeking; from the very first, when you
began to feel foolish about that man, I warned you he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not make you
happy. I felt it so strongly that I did what I would never have believed
myself capable of doing--stood up in the church, and made myself the
public talk for weeks. But having once consented, I don't submit to
these fancies without good reason. Marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) you must after this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I wish to do otherwise for one moment?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin,
with a heavy sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I know how wrong it was of me to love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but don't
pain me by talking like that, Aunt! You would not have had me stay there
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), would you?--and your house is the only home I have to return
to. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says we can be married in a day or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never seen you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; then I will be the miserablest woman in the world, and not
let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) see me again. No, I won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too late to speak so. Come with me. I am going to the inn to see
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has returned. Of course I shall get to the bottom of this story
at once. Mr. Wildeve must not suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) can play tricks upon me, or any
belonging to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not that. The license was wrong, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) couldn't get another the
same day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) will tell you in a moment how it was, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) bring you back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>again sobbed Thomasin. <div class="bookquote">``When I found we could not be
married I didn't like to come back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), and I was very ill. Then
I saw Diggory Venn, and was glad to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) to take me home. I cannot
explain it any better, and you must be angry with me if you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall see about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright; and they turned towards
the inn, known in the neighbourhood as the Quiet Woman, the sign of
which represented the figure of a matron carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) head under her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
arm, beneath which gruesome design was written the couplet so well known
to frequenters of the inn:--


<p/>SINCE THE WOMAN'S QUIET LET NO MAN BREED A RIOT.-LRB-1-RRB-

<p/>-LRB-1-RRB- The inn which really bore this sign and legend stood
some miles to the northwest of the present scene, wherein
the house more immediately referred to is now no longer an
inn; and the surroundings are much changed. But another inn,
some of whose features are also embodied in this
description, the RED LION at Winfrith, still remains as a
haven for the wayfarer -LRB-1912-RRB-.

<p/>The front of the house was towards the heath and Rainbarrow, whose dark
shape seemed to threaten it from the sky. Upon the door was a neglected
brass plate, bearing the unexpected inscription, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wildeve,
Engineer'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--a useless yet cherished relic from the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>wayfarer</b></font>) had been
started in that profession in an office at Budmouth by those who had
hoped much from him (<font color='blue'><b>wayfarer</b></font>), and had been disappointed. The garden was at the
back, and behind this ran a still deep stream, forming the margin of the
heath in that direction, meadow-land appearing beyond the stream.

<p/>But the thick obscurity permitted only skylines to be visible of any
scene at present. The water at the back of the house could be
heard, idly spinning whirpools in its creep between the rows of dry
feather-headed reeds which formed a stockade along each bank. Their
presence was denoted by sounds as of a congregation praying humbly,
produced by their rubbing against each other in the slow wind.

<p/>The window, whence the candlelight had shone up the vale to the eyes
of the bonfire group, was uncurtained, but the sill lay too high for a
pedestrian on the outside to look over it into the room. A vast shadow,
in which could be dimly traced portions of a masculine contour, blotted
half the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Engineer</b></font>) seems to be at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I come in, too, Aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>asked Thomasin faintly. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose not; it
would be wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must come, certainly--to confront him (<font color='blue'><b>Engineer</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Engineer</b></font>) may make no false
representations to me. We shall not be five minutes in the house, and
then we'll walk home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Entering the open passage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) tapped at the door of the private
parlour, unfastened it, and looked in.

<p/>The back and shoulders of a man came between Mrs. Yeobright's eyes and
the fire. Wildeve, whose form it was, immediately turned, arose, and
advanced to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) visitors.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was quite a young man, and of the two properties, form and motion,
the latter first attracted the eye in him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). The grace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) movement
was singular--it was the pantomimic expression of a lady-killing career.
Next came into notice the more material qualities, among which was a
profuse crop of hair impending over the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face, lending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
forehead the high-cornered outline of an early Gothic shield; and a neck
which was smooth and round as a cylinder. The lower half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) figure
was of light build. Altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was one in whom no man would have seen
anything to admire, and in whom no woman would have seen anything to
dislike.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discerned the young girl's form in the passage, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thomasin,
then, has reached home. How could you leave me in that way, darling?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>And turning to Mrs. Yeobright--<div class="bookquote">``It was useless to argue with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
would go, and go alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's the meaning of it all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Yeobright haughtily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a seat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, placing chairs for the two women. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
it was a very stupid mistake, but such mistakes will happen. The license
was useless at Anglebury. It was made out for Budmouth, but as I didn't
read it I wasn't aware of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you had been staying at Anglebury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I had been at Budmouth--till two days ago--and that was where I
had intended to take her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); but when I came to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) we decided upon
Anglebury, forgetting that a new license would be necessary. There was
not time to get to Budmouth afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are very much to blame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was quite my fault we chose Anglebury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Thomasin pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I
proposed it because I was not known there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know so well that I am to blame that you need not remind me of it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Wildeve shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such things don't happen for nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the aunt</b></font>)</div>said the aunt. <div class="bookquote">``It is a great
slight to me and my family; and when it gets known there will be a
very unpleasant time for us. How can she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) look her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) friends in the face
tomorrow? It is a very great injury, and one I cannot easily forgive. It
may even reflect on her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/>Thomasin's large eyes had flown from the face of one to the face of
the other during this discussion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) now said anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``Will you
allow me, Aunt, to talk it over alone with Damon for five minutes? Will
you, Damon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, <div class="bookquote">``if your aunt will excuse us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) led
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) into an adjoining room, leaving Mrs. Yeobright by the fire.

<p/>As soon as they were alone, and the door closed, Thomasin said, turning
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) pale, tearful face to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It is killing me, this, Damon! I did
not mean to part from you in anger at Anglebury this morning; but I was
frightened and hardly knew what I said. I've not let Aunt know how much
I suffered today; and it is so hard to command my face and voice, and to
smile as if it were a slight thing to me; but I try to do so, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
may not be still more indignant with you. I know you could not help it,
dear, whatever Aunt may think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) is very unpleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Thomasin murmured, <div class="bookquote">``and I suppose I seem so now... Damon, what do
you mean to do about me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do about you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Those who don't like you whisper things which at moments make me
doubt you. We mean to marry, I suppose, don't we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we do. We have only to go to Budmouth on Monday, and we marry
at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then do let us go!--O Damon, what you make me say!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) handkerchief. <div class="bookquote">``Here am I asking you to marry me, when by rights
you ought to be on your knees imploring me, your cruel mistress, not
to refuse you, and saying it would break your heart if I did. I used to
think it would be pretty and sweet like that; but how different!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, real life is never at all like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't care personally if it never takes place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) added with a
little dignity; <div class="bookquote">``no, I can live without you. It is Aunt I think of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
is so proud, and thinks so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) family respectability, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
will be cut down with mortification if this story should get abroad
before--it is done. My cousin Clym, too, will be much wounded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) will be very unreasonable. In fact, you are all rather
unreasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin coloured a little, and not with love. But whatever the
momentary feeling which caused that flush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), it went as it came,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) humbly said, <div class="bookquote">``I never mean to be, if I can help it. I merely
feel that you have my aunt to some extent in your power at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a matter of justice it is almost due to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``Think
what I have gone through to win her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) consent; the insult that it is to
any man to have the banns forbidden--the double insult to a man unlucky
enough to be cursed with sensitiveness, and blue demons, and Heaven
knows what, as I am. I can never forget those banns. A harsher man would
rejoice now in the power I have of turning upon your aunt by going no
further in the business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) looked wistfully at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) sorrowful eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said those
words, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aspect showed that more than one person in the room could
deplore the possession of sensitiveness. Seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was really
suffering he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) seemed disturbed and added, <div class="bookquote">``This is merely a reflection
you know. I have not the least intention to refuse to complete the
marriage, Tamsie mine--I could not bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could not, I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the fair girl, brightening. <div class="bookquote">``You, who
cannot bear the sight of pain in even an insect, or any disagreeable
sound, or unpleasant smell even, will not long cause pain to me and
mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not, if I can help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hand upon it, Damon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) carelessly gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, by my crown, what's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said suddenly.

<p/>There fell upon their ears the sound of numerous voices singing in
front of the house. Among these, two made themselves prominent by their
peculiarity: one was a very strong bass, the other a wheezy thin piping.
Thomasin recognized them as belonging to Timothy Fairway and Grandfer
Cantle respectively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it mean--it is not skimmity-riding, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, with a
frightened gaze at Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not; no, it is that the heath-folk have come to sing to us
a welcome. This is intolerable!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) began pacing about, the men outside
singing cheerily--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) told' her (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>)' was the joy' of his (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) life', And if' she (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>)'d
con-sent' he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) wife'; She (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) could' not refuse' him (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>);
to church' so they went', Young Will was forgot', and young Sue' was
content'; And then' was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) kiss'd' and set down' on his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) knee', No man'
in the world' was so lov'-ing as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'!''


 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright burst in from the outer room. <div class="bookquote">``Thomasin, Thomasin!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
said, looking indignantly at Wildeve; <div class="bookquote">``here's a pretty exposure! Let us
escape at once. Come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was, however, too late to get away by the passage. A rugged knocking
had begun upon the door of the front room. Wildeve, who had gone to the
window, came back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said imperiously, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hand upon Mrs. Yeobright's arm.
<div class="bookquote">``We are regularly besieged. There are fifty of them out there if there's
one. You stay in this room with Thomasin; I'll go out and face them. You
must stay now, for my sake, till they are gone, so that it may seem as
if all was right. Come, Tamsie dear, don't go making a scene--we must
marry after this; that you can see as well as I. Sit still, that's
all--and don't speak much. I'll manage them. Blundering fools!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) pressed the agitated girl into a seat, returned to the outer room and
opened the door. Immediately outside, in the passage, appeared Grandfer
Cantle singing in concert with those still standing in front of the
house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) came into the room and nodded abstractedly to Wildeve, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
lips still parted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) features excruciatingly strained in the
emission of the chorus. This being ended, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said heartily, <div class="bookquote">``Here's
welcome to the new-made couple, and God bless `em!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, with dry resentment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face as gloomy as a
thunderstorm.

<p/>At the Grandfer's heels now came the rest of the group, which included
Fairway, Christian, Sam the turf-cutter, Humphrey, and a dozen others.
All smiled upon Wildeve, and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) tables and chairs likewise, from
a general sense of friendliness towards the articles as well as towards
their owner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We be not here afore Mrs. Yeobright after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said Fairway,
recognizing the matron's bonnet through the glass partition which
divided the public apartment they had entered from the room where the
women sat. <div class="bookquote">``We struck down across, d’ye see, Mr. Wildeve, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) went
round by the path.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I see the young bride's little head!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer, peeping in the
same direction, and discerning Thomasin, who was waiting beside her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) aunt
in a miserable and awkward way. <div class="bookquote">``Not quite settled in yet--well, well,
there's plenty of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve made no reply; and probably feeling that the sooner he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) treated
them the sooner they would go, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) produced a stone jar, which threw a
warm halo over matters at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a drop of the right sort, I can see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, with
the air of a man too well-mannered to show any hurry to taste it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, ```tis some old mead. I hope you will like it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>the guests</b></font>)</div>replied the guests, in the hearty tones natural when the words
demanded by politeness coincide with those of deepest feeling. <div class="bookquote">``There
isn't a prettier drink under the sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take my oath there isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added Grandfer Cantle. <div class="bookquote">``All that can be
said against mead is that `tis rather heady, and apt to lie about a man
a good while. But tomorrow's Sunday, thank God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel'd for all the world like some bold soldier after I had had some
once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall feel so again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, with condescension, <div class="bookquote">``Cups or
glasses, gentlemen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you don't mind, we'll have the beaker, and pass `en round;
`tis better than heling it out in dribbles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jown the slippery glasses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle. <div class="bookquote">``What's the good of
a thing that you can't put down in the ashes to warm, hey, neighbours;
that's what I ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right, Grandfer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam; and the mead then circulated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div>said Timothy Fairway, feeling demands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) praise in some
form or other, ```tis a worthy thing to be married, Mr. Wildeve; and the
woman you've got is a dimant, so says I. Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) continued, to Grandfer
Cantle, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) voice so as to be heard through the partition, <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
father -LRB-inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head towards the inner room-RRB- was as good a
feller as ever lived. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always had his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) great indignation ready against
anything underhand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that very dangerous?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there were few in these parts that were upsides with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said
Sam. <div class="bookquote">``Whenever a club walked he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d play the clarinet in the band that
marched before `em as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d never touched anything but a clarinet all
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life. And then, when they got to church door he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d throw down the
clarinet, mount the gallery, snatch up the bass viol, and rozum away as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d never played anything but a bass viol. Folk would say--folk that
knowed what a true stave was--`Surely, surely that's never the same man
that I saw handling the clarinet so masterly by now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can mind it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the furze-cutter. ```Twas a wonderful thing that
one body could hold it all and never mix the fingering.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was Kingsbere church likewise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>Fairway recommenced, as one
opening a new vein of the same mine of interest.

<p/>Wildeve breathed the breath of one intolerably bored, and glanced
through the partition at the prisoners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to walk over there of a Sunday afternoon to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old
acquaintance Andrew Brown, the first clarinet there; a good man enough,
but rather screechy in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) music, if you can mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```A was.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And neighbour Yeobright would take Andrey's place for some part of
the service, to let Andrey have a bit of a nap, as any friend would
naturally do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As any friend would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, the other listeners
expressing the same accord by the shorter way of nodding their heads.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No sooner was Andrey asleep and the first whiff of neighbour
Yeobright's wind had got inside Andrey's clarinet than everyone in
church feeled in a moment there was a great soul among `em. All heads
would turn, and they'd say, `Ah, I thought `twas he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>)!' One Sunday I can
well mind--a bass viol day that time, and Yeobright had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) own.
`Twas the Hundred-and-thirty-third to `Lydia'; and when they'd come
to `Ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ran</b></font>) beard and o’er his (<font color='blue'><b>Ran</b></font>) robes its costly moisture shed,'
neighbour Yeobright, who had just warmed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ran</b></font>) work, drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Ran</b></font>) bow into
them strings that glorious grand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ran</b></font>) e'en a'most sawed the bass
viol into two pieces. Every winder in church rattled as if `twere a
thunderstorm. Old Pa'son Williams lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) great holy
surplice as natural as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>)'d been in common clothes, and seemed to say
hisself, `O for such a man in our parish!' But not a soul in Kingsbere
could hold a candle to Yeobright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it quite safe when the winder shook?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>Christian inquired.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) received no answer, all for the moment sitting rapt in admiration
of the performance described. As with Farinelli's singing before the
princesses, Sheridan's renowned Begum Speech, and other such examples,
the fortunate condition of its being for ever lost to the world invested
the deceased Mr. Yeobright's tour de force on that memorable afternoon
with a cumulative glory which comparative criticism, had that been
possible, might considerably have shorn down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the last you'd have expected to drop off in the prime of life,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looking for the earth some months afore he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went. At
that time women used to run for smocks and gown-pieces at Greenhill

hardly husband-high, went with the rest of the maidens, for `a was a
good, runner afore she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) got so heavy. When she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) came home I said--we were
then just beginning to walk together--`What have ye got, my honey?'
`I've won--well, I've won--a gown-piece,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) colours coming
up in a moment. `Tis a smock for a crown, I thought; and so it turned
out. Ay, when I think what she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'ll say to me now without a mossel of red
in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) face, it do seem strange that `a wouldn't say such a little thing
then... However, then she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) went on, and that's what made me bring up the

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>```A faltered on from one day to another, and then we heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was gone.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D’ye think he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had great pain when `a died?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--quite different. Nor any pain of mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was lucky enough to be
God A’mighty's own man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And other folk--d’ye think `twill be much pain to `em, Mister Fairway?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on whether they be afeard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I bain't afeard at all, I thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>said Christian strenuously. <div class="bookquote">``I'm

 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a solemn silence, and looking from the window, which was
unshuttered and unblinded, Timothy said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, what a fess little
bonfire that one is, out by Cap’n Vye's! `Tis burning just the same now
as ever, upon my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div><p/>All glances went through the window, and nobody noticed that Wildeve
disguised a brief, telltale look. Far away up the sombre valley of
heath, and to the right of Rainbarrow, could indeed be seen the light,
small, but steady and persistent as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was lighted before ours was,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Fairway continued; <div class="bookquote">``and yet every one
in the country round is out afore `n.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps there's meaning in it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>murmured Christian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How meaning?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve sharply.

<p/>Christian was too scattered to reply, and Timothy helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) means, sir, that the lonesome dark-eyed creature up there that some
say is a witch--ever I should call a fine young woman such a name--is
always up to some odd conceit or other; and so perhaps `tis she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd be very glad to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in wedlock, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d hae me and take

staunchly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ye say it, Father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>implored Christian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, be dazed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) who do marry the maid won't hae an uncommon
picture for his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) best parlour,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway in a liquid tone, placing
down the cup of mead at the end of a good pull.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And a partner as deep as the North Star,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, taking up the cup
and finishing the little that remained. <div class="bookquote">``Well, really, now I think we
must be moving,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey, observing the emptiness of the vessel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we'll gie `em another song?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle. <div class="bookquote">``I'm as full of
notes as a bird!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Grandfer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``But we will not trouble you now.
Some other day must do for that--when I have a party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be jown'd if I don't learn ten new songs for't, or I won't learn a
line!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle. <div class="bookquote">``And you may be sure I won't disappoint ye
by biding away, Mr. Wildeve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>said that gentleman.

<p/>All then took their leave, wishing their entertainer long life and
happiness as a married man, with recapitulations which occupied some
time. Wildeve attended them to the door, beyond which the deep-dyed
upward stretch of heath stood awaiting them, an amplitude of darkness
reigning from their feet almost to the zenith, where a definite form
first became visible in the lowering forehead of Rainbarrow. Diving
into the dense obscurity in a line headed by Sam the turf-cutter, they
pursued their trackless way home.

<p/>When the scratching of the furze against their leggings had fainted upon
the ear, Wildeve returned to the room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had left Thomasin and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
aunt. The women were gone.

<p/>They could only have left the house in one way, by the back window; and
this was open.

<p/>Wildeve laughed to himself, remained a moment thinking, and idly
returned to the front room. Here his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) glance fell upon a bottle of wine
which stood on the mantelpiece. <div class="bookquote">``Ah--old Dowden!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) murmured; and going
to the kitchen door shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Is anybody here who can take something to
old Dowden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no reply. The room was empty, the lad who acted as his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
factotum having gone to bed. Wildeve came back put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hat, took the
bottle, and left the house, turning the key in the door, for there was
no guest at the inn tonight. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) was on the road the little
bonfire on Mistover Knap again met his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still waiting, are you, my lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) did not proceed that way just then; but leaving the hill to
the left of him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) stumbled over a rutted road that brought him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) to a
cottage which, like all other habitations on the heath at this hour, was
only saved from being visible by a faint shine from its bedroom window.
This house was the home of Olly Dowden, the besom-maker, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dowden</b></font>) entered.

<p/>The lower room was in darkness; but by feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Dowden</b></font>) way he (<font color='blue'><b>Dowden</b></font>) found a table,
whereon he (<font color='blue'><b>Dowden</b></font>) placed the bottle, and a minute later emerged again upon the
heath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dowden</b></font>) stood and looked northeast at the undying little fire--high up
above him (<font color='blue'><b>Dowden</b></font>), though not so high as Rainbarrow.

<p/>We have been told what happens when a woman deliberates; and the epigram
is not always terminable with woman, provided that one be in the case,
and that a fair one. Wildeve stood, and stood longer, and breathed
perplexedly, and then said to himself with resignation, <div class="bookquote">``Yes--by Heaven,
I must go to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I suppose!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of turning in the direction of home he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) pressed on rapidly by a
path under Rainbarrow towards what was evidently a signal light.




<p/>6--The Figure against the Sky


<p/>When the whole Egdon concourse had left the site of the bonfire to its
accustomed loneliness, a closely wrapped female figure approached the
barrow from that quarter of the heath in which the little fire lay. Had
the reddleman been watching he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) might have recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) as the woman
who had first stood there so singularly, and vanished at the approach
of strangers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) ascended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) old position at the top, where the red
coals of the perishing fire greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) like living eyes in the corpse
of day. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) stood still around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) stretching the vast night
atmosphere, whose incomplete darkness in comparison with the total
darkness of the heath below it might have represented a venial beside a
mortal sin.

<p/>That she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was tall and straight in build, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was lady-like in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
movements, was all that could be learnt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) just now, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) form being
wrapped in a shawl folded in the old cornerwise fashion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) head in
a large kerchief, a protection not superfluous at this hour and place.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) back was towards the wind, which blew from the northwest; but
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had avoided that aspect because of the chilly gusts which
played about her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) exceptional position, or because her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) interest lay in
the southeast, did not at first appear.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) reason for standing so dead still as the pivot of this circle
of heath-country was just as obscure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) extraordinary fixity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
conspicuous loneliness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) heedlessness of night, betokened among other
things an utter absence of fear. A tract of country unaltered from that
sinister condition which made Caesar anxious every year to get clear of
its glooms before the autumnal equinox, a kind of landscape and weather
which leads travellers from the South to describe our island as Homer's
Cimmerian land, was not, on the face of it, friendly to women.

<p/>It might reasonably have been supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was listening to the
wind, which rose somewhat as the night advanced, and laid hold of the
attention. The wind, indeed, seemed made for the scene, as the scene
seemed made for the hour. Part of its tone was quite special; what was
heard there could be heard nowhere else. Gusts in innumerable series
followed each other from the northwest, and when each one of them raced
past the sound of its progress resolved into three. Treble, tenor, and
bass notes were to be found therein. The general ricochet of the whole
over pits and prominences had the gravest pitch of the chime. Next there
could be heard the baritone buzz of a holly tree. Below these in force,
above them in pitch, a dwindled voice strove hard at a husky tune, which
was the peculiar local sound alluded to. Thinner and less immediately
traceable than the other two, it was far more impressive than either. In
it lay what may be called the linguistic peculiarity of the heath; and
being audible nowhere on earth off a heath, it afforded a shadow of
reason for the woman's tenseness, which continued as unbroken as ever.

<p/>Throughout the blowing of these plaintive November winds that note
bore a great resemblance to the ruins of human song which remain to the
throat of fourscore and ten. It was a worn whisper, dry and papery, and
it brushed so distinctly across the ear that, by the accustomed, the
material minutiae in which it originated could be realized as by touch.
It was the united products of infinitesimal vegetable causes, and these
were neither stems, leaves, fruit, blades, prickles, lichen, nor moss.

<p/>They were the mummied heathbells of the past summer, originally tender
and purple, now washed colourless by Michaelmas rains, and dried to dead
skins by October suns. So low was an individual sound from these that a
combination of hundreds only just emerged from silence, and the myriads
of the whole declivity reached the woman's ear but as a shrivelled and
intermittent recitative. Yet scarcely a single accent among the many
afloat tonight could have such power to impress a listener with
thoughts of its origin. One inwardly saw the infinity of those combined
multitudes; and perceived that each of the tiny trumpets was seized on
entered, scoured and emerged from by the wind as thoroughly as if it
were as vast as a crater.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The spirit moved them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A meaning of the phrase forced itself upon the
attention; and an emotional listener's fetichistic mood might have
ended in one of more advanced quality. It was not, after all, that the
left-hand expanse of old blooms spoke, or the right-hand, or those
of the slope in front; but it was the single person of something else
speaking through each at once.

<p/>Suddenly, on the barrow, there mingled with all this wild rhetoric
of night a sound which modulated so naturally into the rest that its
beginning and ending were hardly to be distinguished. The bluffs, and
the bushes, and the heather-bells had broken silence; at last, so did
the woman; and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) articulation was but as another phrase of the same
discourse as theirs. Thrown out on the winds it became twined in with
them, and with them it flew away.

<p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uttered was a lengthened sighing, apparently at something
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind which had led to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presence here. There was a spasmodic
abandonment about it as if, in allowing herself to utter the sound the
woman's brain had authorized what it could not regulate. One point was
evident in this; that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been existing in a suppressed state, and
not in one of languor, or stagnation.

<p/>Far away down the valley the faint shine from the window of the inn
still lasted on; and a few additional moments proved that the window, or
what was within it, had more to do with the woman's sigh than had either
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own actions or the scene immediately around. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left
hand, which held a closed telescope. This she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rapidly extended, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were well accustomed to the operation, and raising it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye
directed it towards the light beaming from the inn.

<p/>The handkerchief which had hooded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head was now a little thrown back,
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face being somewhat elevated. A profile was visible against the dull
monochrome of cloud around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and it was as though side shadows from
the features of Sappho and Mrs. Siddons had converged upwards from the
tomb to form an image like neither but suggesting both. This, however,
was mere superficiality. In respect of character a face may make certain
admissions by its outline; but it fully confesses only in its changes.
So much is this the case that what is called the play of the features
often helps more in understanding a man or woman than the earnest
labours of all the other members together. Thus the night revealed
little of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whose form it was embracing, for the mobile parts of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
countenance could not be seen.

<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spying attitude, closed the telescope, and
turned to the decaying embers. From these no appreciable beams now
radiated, except when a more than usually smart gust brushed over their
faces and raised a fitful glow which came and went like the blush of a
girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stooped over the silent circle, and selecting from the brands
a piece of stick which bore the largest live coal at its end, brought it
to where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been standing before.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) held the brand to the ground, blowing the red coal with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth at
the same time; till it faintly illuminated the sod, and revealed a small
object, which turned out to be an hourglass, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore a watch.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blew long enough to show that the sand had all slipped through.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, as if surprised.

<p/>The light raised by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) breath had been very fitful, and a momentary
irradiation of flesh was all that it had disclosed of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. That
consisted of two matchless lips and a cheek only, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head being still
enveloped. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) threw away the stick, took the glass in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, the
telescope under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arm, and moved on.

<p/>Along the ridge ran a faint foot-track, which the lady followed. Those
who knew it well called it a path; and, while a mere visitor would have
passed it unnoticed even by day, the regular haunters of the heath
were at no loss for it at midnight. The whole secret of following these
incipient paths, when there was not light enough in the atmosphere to
show a turnpike road, lay in the development of the sense of touch in
the feet, which comes with years of night-rambling in little-trodden
spots. To a walker practised in such places a difference between impact
on maiden herbage, and on the crippled stalks of a slight footway, is
perceptible through the thickest boot or shoe.

<p/>The solitary figure who walked this beat took no notice of the windy
tune still played on the dead heathbells. She (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) did not turn her (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) head to
look at a group of dark creatures further on, who fled from her (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) presence
as she (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) skirted a ravine where they fed. They were about a score of the
small wild ponies known as heath-croppers. They roamed at large on the
undulations of Egdon, but in numbers too few to detract much from the
solitude.

<p/>The pedestrian noticed nothing just now, and a clue to her (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) abstraction
was afforded by a trivial incident. A bramble caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) skirt,
and checked her (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) progress. Instead of putting it off and hastening along,
she (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) yielded herself up to the pull, and stood passively still. When she (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>)
began to extricate herself it was by turning round and round, and so
unwinding the prickly switch. She (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) was in a desponding reverie.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) course was in the direction of the small undying fire which had
drawn the attention of the men on Rainbarrow and of Wildeve in the
valley below. A faint illumination from its rays began to glow upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) face, and the fire soon revealed itself to be lit, not on the level
ground, but on a salient corner or redan of earth, at the junction of
two converging bank fences. Outside was a ditch, dry except immediately
under the fire, where there was a large pool, bearded all round by
heather and rushes. In the smooth water of the pool the fire appeared
upside down.

<p/>The banks meeting behind were bare of a hedge, save such as was formed
by disconnected tufts of furze, standing upon stems along the top, like
impaled heads above a city wall. A white mast, fitted up with spars
and other nautical tackle, could be seen rising against the dark clouds
whenever the flames played brightly enough to reach it. Altogether the
scene had much the appearance of a fortification upon which had been
kindled a beacon fire.

<p/>Nobody was visible; but ever and anon a whitish something moved above
the bank from behind, and vanished again. This was a small human hand,
in the act of lifting pieces of fuel into the fire, but for all that
could be seen the hand, like that which troubled Belshazzar, was there
alone. Occasionally an ember rolled off the bank, and dropped with a
hiss into the pool.

<p/>At one side of the pool rough steps built of clods enabled everyone who
wished to do so to mount the bank; which the woman did. Within was a
paddock in an uncultivated state, though bearing evidence of having once
been tilled; but the heath and fern had insidiously crept in, and were
reasserting their old supremacy. Further ahead were dimly visible an
irregular dwelling-house, garden, and outbuildings, backed by a clump of
firs.

<p/>The young lady--for youth had revealed its presence in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) buoyant bound
up the bank--walked along the top instead of descending inside, and came
to the corner where the fire was burning. One reason for the permanence
of the blaze was now manifest: the fuel consisted of hard pieces of
wood, cleft and sawn--the knotty boles of old thorn trees which grew in
twos and threes about the hillsides. A yet unconsumed pile of these lay
in the inner angle of the bank; and from this corner the upturned face
of a little boy greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was dilatorily throwing up a piece
of wood into the fire every now and then, a business which seemed to
have engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a considerable part of the evening, for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face was
somewhat weary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you have come, Miss Eustacia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, with a sigh of
relief. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like biding by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense. I have only been a little way for a walk. I have been gone
only twenty minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seemed long,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>murmured the sad boy. <div class="bookquote">``And you have been so many
times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I thought you would be pleased to have a bonfire. Are you not much
obliged to me for making you one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but there's nobody here to play wi' me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose nobody has come while I've been away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody except your grandfather--he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) looked out of doors once for `ee.
I told him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) you were walking round upon the hill to look at the other
bonfires.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I hear him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coming again, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>An man</b></font>)</div><p/>An old man came into the remoter light of the fire from the direction
of the homestead. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the same who had overtaken the reddleman on the
road that afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked wistfully to the top of the bank at
the woman who stood there, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth, which were quite unimpaired,
showed like parian from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parted lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When are you coming indoors, Eustacia?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked. ```Tis almost bedtime.
I've been home these two hours, and am tired out. Surely `tis somewhat
childish of you to stay out playing at bonfires so long, and wasting
such fuel. My precious thorn roots, the rarest of all firing, that I
laid by on purpose for Christmas--you have burnt `em nearly all!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I promised Johnny a bonfire, and it pleases him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) not to let it go out
just yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia, in a way which told at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was
absolute queen here. <div class="bookquote">``Grandfather, you go in to bed. I shall follow you
soon. You like the fire, don't you, Johnny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy looked up doubtfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) and murmured, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I want
it any longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather had turned back again, and did not hear the boy's reply.
As soon as the white-haired man had vanished she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said in a tone of pique
to the child, <div class="bookquote">``Ungrateful little boy, how can you contradict me? Never
shall you have a bonfire again unless you keep it up now. Come, tell me
you like to do things for me, and don't deny it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>The repressed child said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>and continued to stir the
fire perfunctorily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay a little longer and I will give you a crooked six-pence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said
Eustacia, more gently. <div class="bookquote">``Put in one piece of wood every two or three
minutes, but not too much at once. I am going to walk along the ridge a
little longer, but I shall keep on coming to you. And if you hear a frog
jump into the pond with a flounce like a stone thrown in, be sure you
run and tell me, because it is a sign of rain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Eustacia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vye, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vy--stacia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do. Now put in one stick more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The slave</b></font>)</div><p/>The little slave went on feeding the fire as before. He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) seemed a mere
automaton, galvanized into moving and speaking by the wayward Eustacia's
will. He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) might have been the brass statue which Albertus Magnus is said
to have animated just so far as to make it chatter, and move, and be his (<font color='blue'><b>Magnus</b></font>)
servant.

<p/>Before going on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) walk again the young girl stood still on the bank
for a few instants and listened. It was to the full as lonely a place
as Rainbarrow, though at rather a lower level; and it was more sheltered
from wind and weather on account of the few firs to the north. The bank
which enclosed the homestead, and protected it from the lawless state of
the world without, was formed of thick square clods, dug from the ditch
on the outside, and built up with a slight batter or incline, which
forms no slight defense where hedges will not grow because of the wind
and the wilderness, and where wall materials are unattainable. Otherwise
the situation was quite open, commanding the whole length of the valley
which reached to the river behind Wildeve's house. High above this to
the right, and much nearer thitherward than the Quiet Woman Inn, the
blurred contour of Rainbarrow obstructed the sky.

<p/>After her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) attentive survey of the wild slopes and hollow ravines a
gesture of impatience escaped Eustacia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) vented petulant words
every now and then, but there were sighs between her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) words, and sudden
listenings between her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sighs. Descending from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) perch she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) again
sauntered off towards Rainbarrow, though this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not go the
whole way.

<p/>Twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) reappeared at intervals of a few minutes and each time she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not any flounce into the pond yet, little man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Miss Eustacia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon be going in, and then I will
give you the crooked sixpence, and let you go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank'ee, Miss Eustacia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stoker</b></font>)</div>said the tired stoker, breathing more easily.
And Eustacia again strolled away from the fire, but this time not
towards Rainbarrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) skirted the bank and went round to the wicket
before the house, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stood motionless, looking at the scene.

<p/>Fifty yards off rose the corner of the two converging banks, with the
fire upon it; within the bank, lifting up to the fire one stick at a
time, just as before, the figure of the little child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) idly watched
him (<font color='blue'><b>stoker</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>stoker</b></font>) occasionally climbed up in the nook of the bank and stood
beside the brands. The wind blew the smoke, and the child's hair, and
the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>stoker</b></font>) pinafore, all in the same direction; the breeze died,
and the pinafore and hair lay still, and the smoke went up straight.

<p/>While Eustacia looked on from this distance the boy's form visibly
started--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) slid down the bank and ran across towards the white gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hopfrog have jumped into the pond. Yes, I heard `en!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is going to rain, and you had better go home. You will not be
afraid?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) spoke hurriedly, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) heart had leapt into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) throat
at the boy's words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, because I shall hae the crooked sixpence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, here it is. Now run as fast as you can--not that way--through the
garden here. No other boy in the heath has had such a bonfire as yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy, who clearly had had too much of a good thing, marched away
into the shadows with alacrity. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was gone Eustacia, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
telescope and hourglass by the gate, brushed forward from the wicket
towards the angle of the bank, under the fire.

<p/>Here, screened by the outwork, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) waited. In a few moments a splash was
audible from the pond outside. Had the child been there he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have
said that a second frog had jumped in; but by most people the sound
would have been likened to the fall of a stone into the water. Eustacia
stepped upon the bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) breath.

<p/>Thereupon the contour of a man became dimly visible against the
low-reaching sky over the valley, beyond the outer margin of the pool.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came round it and leapt upon the bank beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). A low laugh escaped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)--the third utterance which the girl had indulged in tonight. The
first, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stood upon Rainbarrow, had expressed anxiety; the
second, on the ridge, had expressed impatience; the present was one
of triumphant pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) joyous eyes rest upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without
speaking, as upon some wondrous thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had created out of chaos.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man Wildeve</b></font>)</div>said the man, who was Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``You give me no peace. Why
do you not leave me alone? I have seen your bonfire all the evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The words were not without emotion, and retained their level tone as if
by a careful equipoise between imminent extremes.

<p/>At this unexpectedly repressing manner in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lover the girl seemed to
repress herself also. <div class="bookquote">``Of course you have seen my fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) answered
with languid calmness, artificially maintained. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I have a
bonfire on the Fifth of November, like other denizens of the heath?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it was meant for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you know it? I have had no word with you since you--you chose
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and walked about with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and deserted me entirely, as if I had
never been yours life and soul so irretrievably!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eustacia! could I forget that last autumn at this same day of the month
and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a signal for
me to come and see you? Why should there have been a bonfire again by
Captain Vye's house if not for the same purpose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes--I own it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cried under her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) breath, with a drowsy fervour
of manner and tone which was quite peculiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't begin
speaking to me as you did, Damon; you will drive me to say words I would
not wish to say to you. I had given you up, and resolved not to think of
you any more; and then I heard the news, and I came out and got the fire
ready because I thought that you had been faithful to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you heard to make you think that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, astonished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you did not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) murmured exultingly. <div class="bookquote">``And I knew it
was because you loved me best, and couldn't do it... Damon, you have
been cruel to me to go away, and I have said I would never forgive you.
I do not think I can forgive you entirely, even now--it is too much for
a woman of any spirit to quite overlook.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had known you wished to call me up here only to reproach me, I
wouldn't have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't mind it, and I do forgive you now that you have not married
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and have come back to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you that I had not married her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My grandfather. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) took a long walk today, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was coming home he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
overtook some person who told him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) of a broken-off wedding--he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) thought it
might be yours, and I knew it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does anybody else know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not. Now Damon, do you see why I lit my signal fire? You did
not think I would have lit it if I had imagined you to have become the
husband of this woman. It is insulting my pride to suppose that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve was silent; it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had supposed as much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you indeed think I believed you were married?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) again demanded
earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``Then you wronged me; and upon my life and heart I can hardly
bear to recognize that you have such ill thoughts of me! Damon, you are
not worthy of me--I see it, and yet I love you. Never mind, let it go--I
must bear your mean opinion as best I may... It is true, is it not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
added with ill-concealed anxiety, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) making no demonstration, <div class="bookquote">``that
you could not bring yourself to give me up, and are still going to love
me best of all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; or why should I have come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said touchily. <div class="bookquote">``Not that
fidelity will be any great merit in me after your kind speech about my
unworthiness, which should have been said by myself if by anybody, and
comes with an ill grace from you. However, the curse of inflammability
is upon me, and I must live under it, and take any snub from a woman. It
has brought me down from engineering to innkeeping--what lower stage it
has in store for me I have yet to learn.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) continued to look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
gloomily.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) seized the moment, and throwing back the shawl so that the firelight
shone full upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face and throat, said with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen
anything better than that in your travels?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia was not one to commit herself to such a position without good
ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even on the shoulders of Thomasin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomasin is a pleasing and innocent woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nothing to do with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cried with quick passionateness. <div class="bookquote">``We
will leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out; there are only you and me now to think of.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>After a
long look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) resumed with the old quiescent warmth, <div class="bookquote">``Must I go
on weakly confessing to you things a woman ought to conceal; and
own that no words can express how gloomy I have been because of that
dreadful belief I held till two hours ago--that you had quite deserted
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry I caused you that pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps it is not wholly because of you that I get gloomy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
archly added. <div class="bookquote">``It is in my nature to feel like that. It was born in my
blood, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hypochondriasis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or else it was coming into this wild heath. I was happy enough at
Budmouth. O the times, O the days at Budmouth! But Egdon will be
brighter again now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve moodily. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know the consequence
of this recall to me, my old darling? I shall come to see you again as
before, at Rainbarrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet I declare that until I got here tonight I intended, after this
one good-bye, never to meet you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't thank you for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, turning away, while indignation
spread through her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) like subterranean heat. <div class="bookquote">``You may come again to
Rainbarrow if you like, but you won't see me; and you may call, but I
shall not listen; and you may tempt me, but I won't give myself to you
any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have said as much before, sweet; but such natures as yours don't so
easily adhere to their words. Neither, for the matter of that, do such
natures as mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the pleasure I have won by my trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) whispered bitterly.
<div class="bookquote">``Why did I try to recall you? Damon, a strange warring takes place in my
mind occasionally. I think when I become calm after you woundings, `Do
I embrace a cloud of common fog after all?' You are a chameleon, and now
you are at your worst colour. Go home, or I shall hate you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) looked absently towards Rainbarrow while one might have counted
twenty, and said, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) did not much mind all this, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will go
home. Do you mean to see me again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you own to me that the wedding is broken off because you love me
best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it would be good policy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You
would get to know the extent of your power too clearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But tell me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I prefer not to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) to you. I have not yet
married her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>); I have come in obedience to your call. That is enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I merely lit that fire because I was dull, and thought I would get a
little excitement by calling you up and triumphing over you as the Witch
of Endor called up Samuel. I determined you should come; and you have
come! I have shown my power. A mile and half hither, and a mile and
half back again to your home--three miles in the dark for me. Have I not
shown my power?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know you too well, my Eustacia; I know you
too well. There isn't a note in you which I don't know; and that hot
little bosom couldn't play such a cold-blooded trick to save its life. I
saw a woman on Rainbarrow at dusk looking down towards my house. I think
I drew out you before you drew out me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The revived embers of an old passion glowed clearly in Wildeve now; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) leant forward as if about to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, intractably moving to the other side of the decayed
fire. <div class="bookquote">``What did you mean by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I may kiss your hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you may not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I may shake your hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I wish you good night without caring for either. Good-bye,
good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) returned no answer, and with the bow of a dancing-master he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
vanished on the other side of the pool as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had come.

<p/>Eustacia sighed--it was no fragile maiden sigh, but a sigh which shook
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) like a shiver. Whenever a flash of reason darted like an
electric light upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lover--as it sometimes would--and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
imperfections, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) shivered thus. But it was over in a second, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) loved on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) trifled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) loved on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
scattered the half-burnt brands, went indoors immediately, and up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bedroom without a light. Amid the rustles which denoted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to be
undressing in the darkness other heavy breaths frequently came; and the
same kind of shudder occasionally moved through her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) when, ten minutes
later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bed asleep.




<p/>7--Queen of Night


<p/>Eustacia Vye was the raw material of a divinity. On Olympus she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) would
have done well with a little preparation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) had the passions and
instincts which make a model goddess, that is, those which make not
quite a model woman. Had it been possible for the earth and mankind to
be entirely in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grasp for a while, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had handled the distaff, the
spindle, and the shears at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own free will, few in the world would
have noticed the change of government. There would have been the same
inequality of lot, the same heaping up of favours here, of contumely
there, the same generosity before justice, the same perpetual dilemmas,
the same captious alteration of caresses and blows that we endure now.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in person full-limbed and somewhat heavy; without ruddiness, as
without pallor; and soft to the touch as a cloud. To see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was
to fancy that a whole winter did not contain darkness enough to form
its shadow--it closed over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead like nightfall extinguishing the
western glow.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nerves extended into those tresses, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) temper could always
be softened by stroking them down. When her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was brushed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
instantly sink into stillness and look like the Sphinx. If, in passing
under one of the Egdon banks, any of its thick skeins were caught,
as they sometimes were, by a prickly tuft of the large Ulex
Europoeus--which will act as a sort of hairbrush--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would go back a
few steps, and pass against it a second time.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had pagan eyes, full of nocturnal mysteries, and their light, as
it came and went, and came again, was partially hampered by their
oppressive lids and lashes; and of these the under lid was much fuller
than it usually is with English women. This enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to indulge in
reverie without seeming to do so--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have been believed capable
of sleeping without closing them up. Assuming that the souls of men and
women were visible essences, you could fancy the colour of Eustacia's
soul to be flamelike. The sparks from it that rose into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) dark pupils
gave the same impression.

<p/>The mouth seemed formed less to speak than to quiver, less to quiver
than to kiss. Some might have added, less to kiss than to curl. Viewed
sideways, the closing-line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lips formed, with almost geometric
precision, the curve so well known in the arts of design as the
cima-recta, or ogee. The sight of such a flexible bend as that on grim
Egdon was quite an apparition. It was felt at once that the mouth did
not come over from Sleswig with a band of Saxon pirates whose lips met
like the two halves of a muffin. One had fancied that such lip-curves
were mostly lurking underground in the South as fragments of forgotten
marbles. So fine were the lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lips that, though full, each
corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mouth was as clearly cut as the point of a spear. This
keenness of corner was only blunted when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was given over to sudden
fits of gloom, one of the phases of the night-side of sentiment which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew too well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) years.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) presence brought memories of such things as Bourbon roses, rubies,
and tropical midnight; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) moods recalled lotus-eaters and the march in
Athalie; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) motions, the ebb and flow of the sea; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) voice, the viola.
In a dim light, and with a slight rearrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) general
figure might have stood for that of either of the higher female deities.
The new moon behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head, an old helmet upon it, a diadem of
accidental dewdrops round her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) brow, would have been adjuncts sufficient
to strike the note of Artemis, Athena, or Hera respectively, with as
close an approximation to the antique as that which passes muster on
many respected canvases.

<p/>But celestial imperiousness, love, wrath, and fervour had proved to be
somewhat thrown away on netherward Egdon. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) power was limited, and the
consciousness of this limitation had biassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) development. Egdon was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) Hades, and since coming there she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) had imbibed much of what was dark
in its tone, though inwardly and eternally unreconciled thereto. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>)
appearance accorded well with this smouldering rebelliousness, and
the shady splendour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) beauty was the real surface of the sad and
stifled warmth within her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>). A true Tartarean dignity sat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) brow,
and not factitiously or with marks of constraint, for it had grown in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) with years.

<p/>Across the upper part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) head she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) wore a thin fillet of black
velvet, restraining the luxuriance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) shady hair, in a way which
added much to this class of majesty by irregularly clouding her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>)
forehead. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing can embellish a beautiful face more than a narrow
band drawn over the brow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Richter</b></font>)</div>says Richter. Some of the neighbouring
girls wore coloured ribbon for the same purpose, and sported metallic
ornaments elsewhere; but if anyone suggested coloured ribbon and
metallic ornaments to Eustacia Vye she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) laughed and went on.

<p/>Why did a woman of this sort live on Egdon Heath? Budmouth was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
native place, a fashionable seaside resort at that date. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the
daughter of the bandmaster of a regiment which had been quartered
there--a Corfiote by birth, and a fine musician--who met his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) future
wife during her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) trip thither with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father the captain, a man of good
family. The marriage was scarcely in accord with the old man's wishes,
for the bandmaster's pockets were as light as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) occupation. But the
musician did his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best; adopted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's name, made England permanently
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home, took great trouble with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) child's education, the expenses
of which were defrayed by the grandfather, and throve as the chief local
musician till her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother's death, when he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) left off thriving, drank, and
died also. The girl was left to the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grandfather, who, since
three of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) ribs became broken in a shipwreck, had lived in this airy
perch on Egdon, a spot which had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) fancy because the house was
to be had for next to nothing, and because a remote blue tinge on
the horizon between the hills, visible from the cottage door, was
traditionally believed to be the English Channel. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hated the change;
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt like one banished; but here she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was forced to abide.

<p/>Thus it happened that in Eustacia's brain were juxtaposed the strangest
assortment of ideas, from old time and from new. There was no middle
distance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) perspective--romantic recollections of sunny afternoons
on an esplanade, with military bands, officers, and gallants around,
stood like gilded letters upon the dark tablet of surrounding Egdon.
Every bizarre effect that could result from the random intertwining of
watering-place glitter with the grand solemnity of a heath, was to be
found in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). Seeing nothing of human life now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) imagined all the
more of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had seen.

<p/>Where did her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) dignity come from? By a latent vein from Alcinous' line,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) father hailing from Phaeacia's isle?--or from Fitzalan and De Vere,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) maternal grandfather having had a cousin in the peerage? Perhaps it
was the gift of Heaven--a happy convergence of natural laws. Among other
things opportunity had of late years been denied her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) of learning to
be undignified, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lived lonely. Isolation on a heath renders
vulgarity well-nigh impossible. It would have been as easy for the
heath-ponies, bats, and snakes to be vulgar as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). A narrow life in
Budmouth might have completely demeaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>The only way to look queenly without realms or hearts to queen it over
is to look as if you had lost them; and Eustacia did that to a triumph.
In the captain's cottage she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could suggest mansions she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had never seen.
Perhaps that was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) frequented a vaster mansion than any of
them, the open hills. Like the summer condition of the place around her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was an embodiment of the phrase <div class="bookquote">``a populous solitude'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--apparently so
listless, void, and quiet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was really busy and full.

<p/>To be loved to madness--such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) great desire. Love was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) the
one cordial which could drive away the eating loneliness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) days.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) seemed to long for the abstraction called passionate love more
than for any particular lover.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could show a most reproachful look at times, but it was directed
less against human beings than against certain creatures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind,
the chief of these being Destiny, through whose interference she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) dimly
fancied it arose that love alighted only on gliding youth--that any love
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) might win would sink simultaneously with the sand in the glass.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) thought of it with an ever-growing consciousness of cruelty, which
tended to breed actions of reckless unconventionality, framed to snatch
a year's, a week's, even an hour's passion from anywhere while it could
be won. Through want of it she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had sung without being merry, possessed
without enjoying, outshone without triumphing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) loneliness deepened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) desire. On Egdon, coldest and meanest kisses were at famine prices,
and where was a mouth matching hers to be found?

<p/>Fidelity in love for fidelity's sake had less attraction for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) than
for most women; fidelity because of love's grip had much. A blaze of
love, and extinction, was better than a lantern glimmer of the same
which should last long years. On this head she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew by prevision what
most women learn only by experience--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had mentally walked round love,
told the towers thereof, considered its palaces, and concluded that love
was but a doleful joy. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) desired it, as one in a desert would be
thankful for brackish water.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) often repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) prayers; not at particular times, but, like the
unaffectedly devout, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) desired to pray. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) prayer was always
spontaneous, and often ran thus, <div class="bookquote">``O deliver my heart from this fearful
gloom and loneliness; send me great love from somewhere, else I shall
die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) high gods were William the Conqueror, Strafford, and Napoleon
Buonaparte, as they had appeared in the Lady's History used at the
establishment in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was educated. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) been a mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would
have christened her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) boys such names as Saul or Sisera in preference to
Jacob or David, neither of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) admired. At school she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had used
to side with the Philistines in several battles, and had wondered if
Pontius Pilate were as handsome as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pilate</b></font>) was frank and fair.

<p/>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was a girl of some forwardness of mind, indeed, weighed in
relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) situation among the very rearward of thinkers, very
original. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) instincts towards social non-comformity were at the root
of this. In the matter of holidays, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mood was that of horses who,
when turned out to grass, enjoy looking upon their kind at work on the
highway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) only valued rest to herself when it came in the midst of
other people's labour. Hence she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) hated Sundays when all was at rest, and
often said they would be the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). To see the heathmen in their
Sunday condition, that is, with their hands in their pockets, their
boots newly oiled, and not laced up -LRB-a particularly Sunday sign-RRB-,
walking leisurely among the turves and furze-faggots they had cut during
the week, and kicking them critically as if their use were unknown, was
a fearful heaviness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). To relieve the tedium of this untimely day
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would overhaul the cupboards containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) grandfather's old charts
and other rubbish, humming Saturday-night ballads of the country people
the while. But on Saturday nights she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would frequently sing a psalm, and
it was always on a weekday that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) read the Bible, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) might be
unoppressed with a sense of doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) duty.

<p/>Such views of life were to some extent the natural begettings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
situation upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) nature. To dwell on a heath without studying its
meanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) tongue. The
subtle beauties of the heath were lost to Eustacia; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) only caught its
vapours. An environment which would have made a contented woman a poet,
a suffering woman a devotee, a pious woman a psalmist, even a giddy
woman thoughtful, made a rebellious woman saturnine.

<p/>Eustacia had got beyond the vision of some marriage of inexpressible
glory; yet, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) emotions were in full vigour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cared for no
meaner union. Thus we see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in a strange state of isolation. To have
lost the godlike conceit that we may do what we will, and not to have
acquired a homely zest for doing what we can, shows a grandeur of temper
which cannot be objected to in the abstract, for it denotes a mind
that, though disappointed, forswears compromise. But, if congenial to
philosophy, it is apt to be dangerous to the commonwealth. In a world
where doing means marrying, and the commonwealth is one of hearts and
hands, the same peril attends the condition.

<p/>And so we see our Eustacia--for at times she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was not altogether
unlovable--arriving at that stage of enlightenment which feels that
nothing is worth while, and filling up the spare hours of her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) existence
by idealizing Wildeve for want of a better object. This was the sole
reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) ascendency: she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) knew it herself. At moments her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) pride
rebelled against her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) passion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) even had longed to be
free. But there was only one circumstance which could dislodge him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), and
that was the advent of a greater man.

<p/>For the rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) suffered much from depression of spirits, and took
slow walks to recover them, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) grandfather's
telescope and her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) grandmother's hourglass--the latter because of a
peculiar pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) derived from watching a material representation of
time's gradual glide away. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) seldom schemed, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) did scheme,
her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) plans showed rather the comprehensive strategy of a general than the
small arts called womanish, though she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) could utter oracles of Delphian
ambiguity when she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) did not choose to be direct. In heaven she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) will
probably sit between the Heloises and the Cleopatras.




<p/>8--Those Who Are Found Where There Is Said to Be Nobody


<p/>As soon as the sad little boy had withdrawn from the fire he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clasped
the money tight in the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand, as if thereby to fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
courage, and began to run. There was really little danger in allowing a
child to go home alone on this part of Egdon Heath. The distance to
the boy's house was not more than three-eighths of a mile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) father's
cottage, and one other a few yards further on, forming part of the small
hamlet of Mistover Knap: the third and only remaining house was that
of Captain Vye and Eustacia, which stood quite away from the small
cottages and was the loneliest of lonely houses on these thinly
populated slopes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ran until he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was out of breath, and then, becoming more courageous,
walked leisurely along, singing in an old voice a little song about a
sailor-boy and a fair one, and bright gold in store. In the middle of
this the child stopped--from a pit under the hill ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) shone a
light, whence proceeded a cloud of floating dust and a smacking noise.

<p/>Only unusual sights and sounds frightened the boy. The shrivelled voice
of the heath did not alarm him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), for that was familiar. The thornbushes
which arose in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) path from time to time were less satisfactory, for
they whistled gloomily, and had a ghastly habit after dark of putting
on the shapes of jumping madmen, sprawling giants, and hideous cripples.
Lights were not uncommon this evening, but the nature of all of them was
different from this. Discretion rather than terror prompted the boy
to turn back instead of passing the light, with a view of asking Miss
Eustacia Vye to let her (<font color='blue'><b>madmen</b></font>) servant accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) home.

<p/>When the boy had reascended to the top of the valley he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) found the fire
to be still burning on the bank, though lower than before. Beside it,
instead of Eustacia's solitary form, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw two persons, the second
being a man. The boy crept along under the bank to ascertain from
the nature of the proceedings if it would be prudent to interrupt so
splendid a creature as Miss Eustacia on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) poor trivial account.

<p/>After listening under the bank for some minutes to the talk he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned in
a perplexed and doubting manner and began to withdraw as silently as
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had come. That he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not, upon the whole, think it advisable to
interrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) conversation with Wildeve, without being prepared to bear
the whole weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) displeasure, was obvious.

<p/>Here was a Scyllaeo-Charybdean position for a poor boy. Pausing when
again safe from discovery, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) finally decided to face the pit phenomenon
as the lesser evil. With a heavy sigh he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) retraced the slope, and
followed the path he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had followed before.

<p/>The light had gone, the rising dust had disappeared--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hoped for ever.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) marched resolutely along, and found nothing to alarm him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) till, coming
within a few yards of the sandpit, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heard a slight noise in front,
which led him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to halt. The halt was but momentary, for the noise
resolved itself into the steady bites of two animals grazing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'th-croppers down here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said aloud. <div class="bookquote">``I have never known `em
come down so far afore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>The animals were in the direct line of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) path, but that the child
thought little of; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had played round the fetlocks of horses from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
infancy. On coming nearer, however, the boy was somewhat surprised to
find that the little creatures did not run off, and that each wore a
clog, to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) going astray; this signified that they had been
broken in. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could now see the interior of the pit, which, being in
the side of the hill, had a level entrance. In the innermost corner the
square outline of a van appeared, with its back towards him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). A light
came from the interior, and threw a moving shadow upon the vertical face
of gravel at the further side of the pit into which the vehicle faced.

<p/>The child assumed that this was the cart of a gipsy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dread of
those wanderers reached but to that mild pitch which titillates rather
than pains. Only a few inches of mud wall kept him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) family from
being gipsies themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) skirted the gravel pit at a respectful
distance, ascended the slope, and came forward upon the brow, in order
to look into the open door of the van and see the original of the
shadow.

<p/>The picture alarmed the boy. By a little stove inside the van sat a
figure red from head to heels--the man who had been Thomasin's friend.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was darning a stocking, which was red like the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Moreover,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) darned he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) smoked a pipe, the stem and bowl of which were red also.

<p/>At this moment one of the heath-croppers feeding in the outer shadows
was audibly shaking off the clog attached to its foot. Aroused by the
sound, the reddleman laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stocking, lit a lantern which hung
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and came out from the van. In sticking up the candle he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
lifted the lantern to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face, and the light shone into the whites
of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ivory teeth, which, in contrast with the
red surrounding, lent him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a startling aspect enough to the gaze of a
juvenile. The boy knew too well for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) peace of mind upon whose lair
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had lighted. Uglier persons than gipsies were known to cross Egdon at
times, and a reddleman was one of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I wish `twas only a gipsy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>The man was by this time coming back from the horses. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) fear of
being seen the boy rendered detection certain by nervous motion. The
heather and peat stratum overhung the brow of the pit in mats, hiding
the actual verge. The boy had stepped beyond the solid ground; the
heather now gave way, and down he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rolled over the scarp of grey sand to
the very foot of the man.

<p/>The red man opened the lantern and turned it upon the figure of the
prostrate boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who be ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Johnny Nunsuch, master!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you doing up there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Watching me, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you watch me for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I was coming home from Miss Vye's bonfire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beest hurt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, you be--your hand is bleeding. Come under my tilt and let me
tie it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please let me look for my sixpence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you come by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vye gied it to me for keeping up her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bonfire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The sixpence was found, and the man went to the van, the boy behind,
almost holding his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breath.

<p/>The man took a piece of rag from a satchel containing sewing materials,
tore off a strip, which, like everything else, was tinged red, and
proceeded to bind up the wound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My eyes have got foggy-like--please may I sit down, master?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the
boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, poor chap. `Tis enough to make you feel fainty. Sit on that
bundle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man finished tying up the gash, and the boy said, <div class="bookquote">``I think I'll go
home now, master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are rather afraid of me. Do you know what I be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child surveyed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) vermilion figure up and down with much misgiving
and finally said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The reddleman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's what I be. Though there's more than one. You little
children think there's only one cuckoo, one fox, one giant, one devil,
and one reddleman, when there's lots of us all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there? You won't carry me off in your bags, will ye, master? `Tis
said that the reddleman will sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense. All that reddlemen do is sell reddle. You see all these bags
at the back of my cart? They are not full of little boys--only full of
red stuff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was you born a reddleman?''

proceeded to darn again.




<p/>9--Love Leads a Shrewd Man into Strategy


<p/>Reddlemen of the old school are now but seldom seen. Since the
introduction of railways Wessex farmers have managed to do without these
Mephistophelian visitants, and the bright pigment so largely used by
shepherds in preparing sheep for the fair is obtained by other routes.
Even those who yet survive are losing the poetry of existence which
characterized them when the pursuit of the trade meant periodical
journeys to the pit whence the material was dug, a regular camping out
from month to month, except in the depth of winter, a peregrination
among farms which could be counted by the hundred, and in spite of this
Arab existence the preservation of that respectability which is insured
by the never-failing production of a well-lined purse.

<p/>Reddle spreads its lively hues over everything it lights on, and stamps
unmistakably, as with the mark of Cain, any person who has handled it
half an hour.

<p/>A child's first sight of a reddleman was an epoch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) life. That
blood-coloured figure was a sublimation of all the horrid dreams
which had afflicted the juvenile spirit since imagination began. <div class="bookquote">``The
reddleman is coming for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wessex</b></font>)</div>had been the formulated threat of Wessex
mothers for many generations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) was successfully supplanted for a
while, at the beginning of the present century, by Buonaparte; but as
process of time rendered the latter personage stale and ineffective the
older phrase resumed its early prominence. And now the reddleman has
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) turn followed Buonaparte to the land of worn-out bogeys, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>)
place is filled by modern inventions.

<p/>The reddleman lived like a gipsy; but gipsies he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) scorned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) was about
as thriving as travelling basket and mat makers; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) had nothing
to do with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) was more decently born and brought up than the
cattledrovers who passed and repassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) wanderings; but they
merely nodded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) stock was more valuable than that of pedlars;
but they did not think so, and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) cart with eyes straight ahead.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) was such an unnatural colour to look at that the men of roundabouts
and waxwork shows seemed gentlemen beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) considered them
low company, and remained aloof. Among all these squatters and folks
of the road the reddleman continually found himself; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) was not of
them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) occupation tended to isolate him (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>), and isolated he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) was mostly
seen to be.

<p/>It was sometimes suggested that reddlemen were criminals for whose
misdeeds other men wrongfully suffered--that in escaping the law they
had not escaped their own consciences, and had taken to the trade as a
lifelong penance. Else why should they have chosen it? In the present
case such a question would have been particularly apposite. The
reddleman who had entered Egdon that afternoon was an instance of the
pleasing being wasted to form the ground-work of the singular, when an
ugly foundation would have done just as well for that purpose. The one
point that was forbidding about this reddleman was his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) colour. Freed
from that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) would have been as agreeable a specimen of rustic manhood
as one would often see. A keen observer might have been inclined to
think--which was, indeed, partly the truth--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) had relinquished
his (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) proper station in life for want of interest in it. Moreover, after
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) one would have hazarded the guess that good nature, and
an acuteness as extreme as it could be without verging on craft, formed
the framework of his (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) character.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) darned the stocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) face became rigid with thought. Softer
expressions followed this, and then again recurred the tender sadness
which had sat upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) drive along the highway that
afternoon. Presently his (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) needle stopped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) laid down the stocking,
arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Freed</b></font>) seat, and took a leathern pouch from a hook in the corner
of the van. This contained among other articles a brown-paper packet,
which, to judge from the hinge-like character of its worn folds, seemed
to have been carefully opened and closed a good many times. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sat down
on a three-legged milking stool that formed the only seat in the van,
and, examining his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) packet by the light of a candle, took thence an old
letter and spread it open. The writing had originally been traced on
white paper, but the letter had now assumed a pale red tinge from the
accident of its situation; and the black strokes of writing thereon
looked like the twigs of a winter hedge against a vermilion sunset. The
letter bore a date some two years previous to that time, and was signed
<div class="bookquote">``Thomasin Yeobright.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It ran as follows:--


<p/>DEAR DIGGORY VENN,--The question you put when you overtook me coming
home from Pond-close gave me such a surprise that I am afraid I did not
make you exactly understand what I meant. Of course, if my aunt had not
met me I could have explained all then at once, but as it was there was
no chance. I have been quite uneasy since, as you know I do not wish
to pain you, yet I fear I shall be doing so now in contradicting what
I seemed to say then. I cannot, Diggory, marry you, or think of letting
you call me your sweetheart. I could not, indeed, Diggory. I hope you
will not much mind my saying this, and feel in a great pain. It makes me
very sad when I think it may, for I like you very much, and I always put
you next to my cousin Clym in my mind. There are so many reasons why we
cannot be married that I can hardly name them all in a letter. I did not
in the least expect that you were going to speak on such a thing when
you followed me, because I had never thought of you in the sense of a
lover at all. You must not becall me for laughing when you spoke; you
mistook when you thought I laughed at you as a foolish man. I laughed
because the idea was so odd, and not at you at all. The great reason
with my own personal self for not letting you court me is, that I do not
feel the things a woman ought to feel who consents to walk with you
with the meaning of being your wife. It is not as you think, that I have
another in my mind, for I do not encourage anybody, and never have in
my life. Another reason is my aunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would not, I know, agree to it,
even if I wished to have you. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) likes you very well, but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will
want me to look a little higher than a small dairy-farmer, and marry
a professional man. I hope you will not set your heart against me for
writing plainly, but I felt you might try to see me again, and it is
better that we should not meet. I shall always think of you as a good
man, and be anxious for your well-doing. I send this by Jane Orchard's
little maid,--And remain Diggory, your faithful friend,

<p/>THOMASIN YEOBRIGHT.

<p/>To MR. VENN, Dairy-farmer.


<p/>Since the arrival of that letter, on a certain autumn morning long ago,
the reddleman and Thomasin had not met till today. During the interval
he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) had shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) position even further from hers than it had
originally been, by adopting the reddle trade; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) was really in
very good circumstances still. Indeed, seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) expenditure was
only one-fourth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) income, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) might have been called a prosperous
man.

<p/>Rejected suitors take to roaming as naturally as unhived bees; and the
business to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) had cynically devoted himself was in many ways
congenial to Venn. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) wanderings, by mere stress of old emotions,
had frequently taken an Egdon direction, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) never intruded upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) who attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) thither. To be in Thomasin's heath, and near her (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>),
yet unseen, was the one ewe-lamb of pleasure left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>).

<p/>Then came the incident of that day, and the reddleman, still loving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) well, was excited by this accidental service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) at a critical
juncture to vow an active devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) cause, instead of, as
hitherto, sighing and holding aloof. After what had happened it was
impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) should not doubt the honesty of Wildeve's intentions.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) hope was apparently centred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>); and dismissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) regrets
Venn determined to aid her (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) to be happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) own chosen way. That this
way was, of all others, the most distressing to himself, was awkward
enough; but the reddleman's love was generous.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) first active step in watching over Thomasin's interests was taken
about seven o’clock the next evening and was dictated by the news which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) had learnt from the sad boy. That Eustacia was somehow the cause
of Wildeve's carelessness in relation to the marriage had at once been
Venn's conclusion on hearing of the secret meeting between them. It did
not occur to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) mind that Eustacia's love signal to Wildeve was the
tender effect upon the deserted beauty of the intelligence which her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
grandfather had brought home. His (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) instinct was to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) as a
conspirator against rather than as an antecedent obstacle to Thomasin's
happiness.

<p/>During the day he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had been exceedingly anxious to learn the condition of
Thomasin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) did not venture to intrude upon a threshold to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was a stranger, particularly at such an unpleasant moment as this. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
had occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) time in moving with his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) ponies and load to a new point
in the heath, eastward to his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) previous station; and here he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) selected a
nook with a careful eye to shelter from wind and rain, which seemed to
mean that his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) stay there was to be a comparatively extended one. After
this he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) returned on foot some part of the way that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had come; and,
it being now dark, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) diverged to the left till he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) stood behind a holly
bush on the edge of a pit not twenty yards from Rainbarrow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) watched for a meeting there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) watched in vain. Nobody except
himself came near the spot that night.

<p/>But the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) labour produced little effect upon the reddleman.
He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had stood in the shoes of Tantalus, and seemed to look upon a certain
mass of disappointment as the natural preface to all realizations,
without which preface they would give cause for alarm.

<p/>The same hour the next evening found him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) again at the same place; but
Eustacia and Wildeve, the expected trysters, did not appear.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) pursued precisely the same course yet four nights longer, and without
success. But on the next, being the day-week of their previous meeting,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) saw a female shape floating along the ridge and the outline of
a young man ascending from the valley. They met in the little ditch
encircling the tumulus--the original excavation from which it had been
thrown up by the ancient British people.

<p/>The reddleman, stung with suspicion of wrong to Thomasin, was aroused
to strategy in a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instantly left the bush and crept forward on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and knees. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had got as close as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might safely venture
without discovery he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that, owing to a cross-wind, the conversation
of the trysting pair could not be overheard.

<p/>Near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as in divers places about the heath, were areas strewn with
large turves, which lay edgeways and upside down awaiting removal by
Timothy Fairway, previous to the winter weather. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) took two of these
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) lay, and dragged them over him (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) till one covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) head and
shoulders, the other his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) back and legs. The reddleman would now have
been quite invisible, even by daylight; the turves, standing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>)
with the heather upwards, looked precisely as if they were growing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>)
crept along again, and the turves upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) back crept with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>)
approached without any covering the chances are that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) would not
have been perceived in the dusk; approaching thus, it was as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>)
burrowed underground. In this manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) came quite close to where the
two were standing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wish to consult me on the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) ears in the rich,
impetuous accents of Eustacia Vye. <div class="bookquote">``Consult me? It is an indignity to
me to talk so--I won't bear it any longer!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) began weeping. <div class="bookquote">``I have
loved you, and have shown you that I loved you, much to my regret; and
yet you can come and say in that frigid way that you wish to consult
with me whether it would not be better to marry Thomasin. Better--of
course it would be. Marry her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is nearer to your own position in
life than I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; that's very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve peremptorily. <div class="bookquote">``But we must
look at things as they are. Whatever blame may attach to me for having
brought it about, Thomasin's position is at present much worse than
yours. I simply tell you that I am in a strait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But you shall not tell me! You must see that it is only harassing me.
Damon, you have not acted well; you have sunk in my opinion. You have
not valued my courtesy--the courtesy of a lady in loving you--who used
to think of far more ambitious things. But it was Thomasin's fault.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won you away from me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deserves to suffer for it. Where is
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) staying now? Not that I care, nor where I am myself. Ah, if I were
dead and gone how glad she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be! Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomasin is now staying at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aunt's shut up in a bedroom, and keeping
out of everybody's sight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said indifferently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you care much about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) even now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia with
sudden joyousness, <div class="bookquote">``for if you did you wouldn't talk so coolly about
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Do you talk so coolly to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) about me? Ah, I expect you do! Why did
you originally go away from me? I don't think I can ever forgive you,
except on one condition, that whenever you desert me, you come back
again, sorry that you served me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never wish to desert you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not thank you for that. I should hate it to be all smooth. Indeed,
I think I like you to desert me a little once now and then. Love is the
dismallest thing where the lover is quite honest. O, it is a shame to
say so; but it is true!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) indulged in a little laugh. <div class="bookquote">``My low spirits
begin at the very idea. Don't you offer me tame love, or away you go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Tamsie were not such a confoundedly good little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said
Wildeve, <div class="bookquote">``so that I could be faithful to you without injuring a worthy
person. It is I who am the sinner after all; I am not worth the little
finger of either of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must not sacrifice yourself to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from any sense of justice,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>replied Eustacia quickly. <div class="bookquote">``If you do not love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) it is the most
merciful thing in the long run to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is. That's always
the best way. There, now I have been unwomanly, I suppose. When you have
left me I am always angry with myself for things that I have said to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve walked a pace or two among the heather without replying. The
pause was filled up by the intonation of a pollard thorn a little way to
windward, the breezes filtering through its unyielding twigs as through
a strainer. It was as if the night sang dirges with clenched teeth.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) continued, half sorrowfully, <div class="bookquote">``Since meeting you last, it has
occurred to me once or twice that perhaps it was not for love of me you
did not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Tell me, Damon--I'll try to bear it. Had I nothing
whatever to do with the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you press me to tell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I must know. I see I have been too ready to believe in my own
power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the immediate reason was that the license would not do for the
place, and before I could get another she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran away. Up to that point
you had nothing to do with it. Since then her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt has spoken to me in a
tone which I don't at all like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes! I am nothing in it--I am nothing in it. You only trifle with
me. Heaven, what can I, Eustacia Vye, be made of to think so much of
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense; do not be so passionate... Eustacia, how we roved among these
bushes last year, when the hot days had got cool, and the shades of the
hills kept us almost invisible in the hollows!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remained in moody silence till she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes; and how I used to
laugh at you for daring to look up to me! But you have well made me
suffer for that since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you served me cruelly enough until I thought I had found someone
fairer than you. A blessed find for me, Eustacia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you still think you found somebody fairer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. The scales are balanced so nicely
that a feather would turn them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't you really care whether I meet you or whether I don't?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
said slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I care a little, but not enough to break my rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the young
man languidly. <div class="bookquote">``No, all that's past. I find there are two flowers where

number as good as the first... Mine is a curious fate. Who would have
thought that all this could happen to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) interrupted with a suppressed fire of which either love or anger
seemed an equally possible issue, <div class="bookquote">``Do you love me now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me; I will know it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, and I do not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mischievously. <div class="bookquote">``That is, I have my times
and my seasons. One moment you are too tall, another moment you are too
do-nothing, another too melancholy, another too dark, another I don't
know what, except--that you are not the whole world to me that you used
to be, my dear. But you are a pleasant lady to know and nice to meet,
and I dare say as sweet as ever--almost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia was silent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), till she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, in a voice
of suspended mightiness, <div class="bookquote">``I am for a walk, and this is my way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I can do worse than follow you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you can't do otherwise, for all your moods and changes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
answered defiantly. <div class="bookquote">``Say what you will; try as you may; keep away from
me all that you can--you will never forget me. You will love me all your
life long. You would jump to marry me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I would!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``Such strange thoughts as I've had from time
to time, Eustacia; and they come to me this moment. You hate the heath
as much as ever; that I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) murmured deeply. ```Tis my cross, my shame, and will be my
death!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I abhor it too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How mournfully the wind blows round us now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not answer. Its tone was indeed solemn and pervasive. Compound
utterances addressed themselves to their senses, and it was possible to
view by ear the features of the neighbourhood. Acoustic pictures were
returned from the darkened scenery; they could hear where the tracts of
heather began and ended; where the furze was growing stalky and tall;
where it had been recently cut; in what direction the fir-clump lay,
and how near was the pit in which the hollies grew; for these differing
features had their voices no less than their shapes and colours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God, how lonely it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>resumed Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``What are picturesque ravines
and mists to us who see nothing else? Why should we stay here? Will you
go with me to America? I have kindred in Wisconsin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That wants consideration.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems impossible to do well here, unless one were a wild bird or a
landscape-painter. Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) softly said, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``America is so far
away. Are you going to walk with me a little way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>As Eustacia uttered the latter words she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) retired from the base of the
barrow, and Wildeve followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), so that the reddleman could hear no
more.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) lifted the turves and arose. Their black figures sank and disappeared
from against the sky. They were as two horns which the sluggish heath
had put forth from its crown, like a mollusc, and had now again drawn
in.

<p/>The reddleman's walk across the vale, and over into the next where his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
cart lay, was not sprightly for a slim young fellow of twenty-four. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
spirit was perturbed to aching. The breezes that blew around his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mouth
in that walk carried off upon them the accents of a commination.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) entered the van, where there was a fire in a stove. Without lighting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) candle he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) sat down at once on the three-legged stool, and pondered
on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had seen and heard touching that still-loved one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) uttered a sound which was neither sigh nor sob, but was even more
indicative than either of a troubled mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Tamsie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) whispered heavily. <div class="bookquote">``What can be done? Yes, I will see
that Eustacia Vye.''




 (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>10--A Desperate Attempt at Persuasion


<p/>The next morning, at the time when the height of the sun appeared very
insignificant from any part of the heath as compared with the altitude
of Rainbarrow, and when all the little hills in the lower levels were
like an archipelago in a fog-formed Aegean, the reddleman came from
the brambled nook which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had adopted as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) quarters and ascended the
slopes of Mistover Knap.

<p/>Though these shaggy hills were apparently so solitary, several keen
round eyes were always ready on such a wintry morning as this to
converge upon a passer-by. Feathered species sojourned here in hiding
which would have created wonder if found elsewhere. A bustard haunted
the spot, and not many years before this five and twenty might have been
seen in Egdon at one time. Marsh-harriers looked up from the valley by
Wildeve's. A cream-coloured courser had used to visit this hill, a bird
so rare that not more than a dozen have ever been seen in England; but
a barbarian rested neither night nor day till he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had shot the African
truant, and after that event cream-coloured coursers thought fit to
enter Egdon no more.

<p/>A traveller who should walk and observe any of these visitants as Venn
observed them now could feel himself to be in direct communication with
regions unknown to man. Here in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a wild mallard--just
arrived from the home of the north wind. The creature brought within
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an amplitude of Northern knowledge. Glacial catastrophes, snowstorm
episodes, glittering auroral effects, Polaris in the zenith, Franklin
underfoot--the category of his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) commonplaces was wonderful. But the bird,
like many other philosophers, seemed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) looked at the reddleman to
think that a present moment of comfortable reality was worth a decade of
memories.

<p/>Venn passed on through these towards the house of the isolated beauty
who lived up among them and despised them. The day was Sunday; but as
going to church, except to be married or buried, was exceptional at
Egdon, this made little difference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had determined upon the bold
stroke of asking for an interview with Miss Vye--to attack her (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) position
as Thomasin's rival either by art or by storm, showing therein, somewhat
too conspicuously, the want of gallantry characteristic of a certain
astute sort of men, from clowns to kings. The great Frederick making war
on the beautiful Archduchess, Napoleon refusing terms to the beautiful
Queen of Prussia, were not more dead to difference of sex than the
reddleman was, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) peculiar way, in planning the displacement of
Eustacia.

<p/>To call at the captain's cottage was always more or less an undertaking
for the inferior inhabitants. Though occasionally chatty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) moods
were erratic, and nobody could be certain how he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) would behave at
any particular moment. Eustacia was reserved, and lived very much
to herself. Except the daughter of one of the cotters, who was their
servant, and a lad who worked in the garden and stable, scarcely anyone
but themselves ever entered the house. They were the only genteel people
of the district except the Yeobrights, and though far from rich, they
did not feel that necessity for preserving a friendly face towards every
man, bird, and beast which influenced their poorer neighbours.

<p/>When the reddleman entered the garden the old man was looking through
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass at the stain of blue sea in the distant landscape, the little
anchors on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) buttons twinkling in the sun. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognized Venn as
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion on the highway, but made no remark on that circumstance,
merely saying, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, reddleman--you here? Have a glass of grog?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn declined, on the plea of it being too early, and stated that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) business was with Miss Vye. The captain surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) from cap to
waistcoat and from waistcoat to leggings for a few moments, and finally
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to go indoors.

<p/>Miss Vye was not to be seen by anybody just then; and the reddleman
waited in the window-bench of the kitchen, his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hands hanging across his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
divergent knees, and his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) cap hanging from his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose the young lady is not up yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) presently said to the
servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite yet. Folks never call upon ladies at this time of day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll step outside,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is willing to see me, will
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) please send out word, and I'll come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman left the house and loitered on the hill adjoining. A
considerable time elapsed, and no request for his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) presence was brought.
He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was beginning to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) scheme had failed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) beheld
the form of Eustacia herself coming leisurely towards him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). A sense of
novelty in giving audience to that singular figure had been sufficient
to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) forth.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) seemed to feel, after a bare look at Diggory Venn, that the man had
come on a strange errand, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not so mean as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had thought
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) close approach did not cause him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to writhe uneasily,
or shift his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, or show any of those little signs which escape an
ingenuous rustic at the advent of the uncommon in womankind. On his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
inquiring if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have a conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
walk beside me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and continued to move on.

<p/>Before they had gone far it occurred to the perspicacious reddleman that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have acted more wisely by appearing less unimpressionable, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolved to correct the error as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could find opportunity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have made so bold, miss, as to step across and tell you some strange
news which has come to my ears about that man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! what man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow to the southeast--the direction of the Quiet Woman.

<p/>Eustacia turned quickly to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean Mr. Wildeve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is trouble in a household on account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), and I have come
to let you know of it, because I believe you might have power to drive
it away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? What is the trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite a secret. It is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) may refuse to marry Thomasin
Yeobright after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia, though set inwardly pulsing by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words, was equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
part in such a drama as this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied coldly, <div class="bookquote">``I do not wish to
listen to this, and you must not expect me to interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, miss, you will hear one word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot. I am not interested in the marriage, and even if I were I
could not compel Mr. Wildeve to do my bidding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As the only lady on the heath I think you might,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn with subtle
indirectness. <div class="bookquote">``This is how the case stands. Mr. Wildeve would marry
Thomasin at once, and make all matters smooth, if so be there were not
another woman in the case. This other woman is some person he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) has picked
up with, and meets on the heath occasionally, I believe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) will never
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and yet through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) may never marry the woman who loves
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) dearly. Now, if you, miss, who have so much sway over us menfolk,
were to insist that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) should treat your young neighbour Tamsin with
honourable kindness and give up the other woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would perhaps do it,
and save her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a good deal of misery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my life!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia, with a laugh which unclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lips so
that the sun shone into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mouth as into a tulip, and lent it a similar
scarlet fire. <div class="bookquote">``You think too much of my influence over menfolk indeed,
reddleman. If I had such a power as you imagine I would go straight and
use it for the good of anybody who has been kind to me--which Thomasin
Yeobright has not particularly, to my knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can it be that you really don't know of it--how much she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had always
thought of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never heard a word of it. Although we live only two miles apart
I have never been inside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt's house in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>The superciliousness that lurked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) manner told Venn that thus
far he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had utterly failed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) inwardly sighed and felt it necessary to
unmask his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) second argument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, leaving that out of the question, `tis in your power, I assure
you, Miss Vye, to do a great deal of good to another woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your comeliness is law with Mr. Wildeve. It is law with all men who see
`ee. They say, `This well-favoured lady coming--what's her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name? How
handsome!' Handsomer than Thomasin Yeobright,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>the reddleman persisted,
saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``God forgive a rascal for lying!''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was
handsomer, but the reddleman was far from thinking so. There was a
certain obscurity in Eustacia's beauty, and Venn's eye was not trained.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) winter dress, as now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was like the tiger-beetle, which, when
observed in dull situations, seems to be of the quietest neutral colour,
but under a full illumination blazes with dazzling splendour.

<p/>Eustacia could not help replying, though conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) endangered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) dignity thereby. <div class="bookquote">``Many women are lovelier than Thomasin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``so not much attaches to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman suffered the wound and went on: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is a man who notices
the looks of women, and you could twist him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to your will like withywind,
if you only had the mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cannot do who has been so much with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) I cannot do
living up here away from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman wheeled and looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in the face. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Vye!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you say that--as if you doubted me?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) spoke faintly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
breathing was quick. <div class="bookquote">``The idea of your speaking in that tone to me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) added, with a forced smile of hauteur. <div class="bookquote">``What could have been in your
mind to lead you to speak like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vye, why should you make believe that you don't know this man?--I
know why, certainly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is beneath you, and you are ashamed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken. What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman had decided to play the card of truth. <div class="bookquote">``I was at the
meeting by Rainbarrow last night and heard every word,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The
woman that stands between Wildeve and Thomasin is yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Candaules wife</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a disconcerting lift of the curtain, and the mortification of
Candaules' wife glowed in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The moment had arrived when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lip would
tremble in spite of herself, and when the gasp could no longer be kept
down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am unwell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``No--it is not that--I am not in a
humour to hear you further. Leave me, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must speak, Miss Vye, in spite of paining you. What I would put
before you is this. However it may come about--whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is to blame,
or you--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) case is without doubt worse than yours. Your giving up Mr.
Wildeve will be a real advantage to you, for how could you marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)?
Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot get off so easily--everybody will blame her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loses
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). Then I ask you--not because her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right is best, but because her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
situation is worst--to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I won't, I won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said impetuously, quite forgetful of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
previous manner towards the reddleman as an underling. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody has ever
been served so! It was going on well--I will not be beaten down--by an
inferior woman like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). It is very well for you to come and plead for
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not herself the cause of all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own trouble? Am I not
to show favour to any person I may choose without asking permission of a
parcel of cottagers? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has come between me and my inclination, and now
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finds herself rightly punished she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gets you to plead for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Venn earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knows nothing whatever about it. It
is only I who ask you to give him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up. It will be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and you
both. People will say bad things if they find out that a lady secretly
meets a man who has ill-used another woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have NOT injured her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was mine before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was hers! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came
back--because--because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked me best!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said wildly. <div class="bookquote">``But I lose
all self-respect in talking to you. What am I giving way to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can keep secrets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Venn gently. <div class="bookquote">``You need not fear. I am the
only man who knows of your meetings with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There is but one thing
more to speak of, and then I will be gone. I heard you say to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that
you hated living here--that Egdon Heath was a jail to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did say so. There is a sort of beauty in the scenery, I know; but it
is a jail to me. The man you mention does not save me from that feeling,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives here. I should have cared nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had there been
a better person near.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman looked hopeful; after these words from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) third
attempt seemed promising. <div class="bookquote">``As we have now opened our minds a bit, miss,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I have got to propose. Since I have taken
to the reddle trade I travel a good deal, as you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head, and swept round so that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes rested in the
misty vale beneath them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And in my travels I go near Budmouth. Now Budmouth is a wonderful
place--wonderful--a great salt sheening sea bending into the land like

rest--out of every ten folks you meet nine of `em in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said disdainfully. <div class="bookquote">``I know Budmouth better than you.
I was born there. My father came to be a military musician there from

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman was surprised to see how a slow fire could blaze on
occasion. <div class="bookquote">``If you were, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``in a week's time you would
think no more of Wildeve than of one of those he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'th-croppers that we see
yond. Now, I could get you there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia, with intense curiosity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) heavy eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle has been for five and twenty years the trusty man of a rich
widow-lady who has a beautiful house facing the sea. This lady has
become old and lame, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wants a young company-keeper to read and
sing to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but can't get one to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind to save her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ve advertised in the papers, and tried half a dozen. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would jump
to get you, and Uncle would make it all easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have to work, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not real work--you'd have a little to do, such as reading and that.
You would not be wanted till New Year's Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it meant work,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, drooping to languor again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess there would be a trifle to do in the way of amusing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>);
but though idle people might call it work, working people would call
it play. Think of the company and the life you'd lead, miss; the gaiety
you'd see, and the gentleman you'd marry. My uncle is to inquire for a
trustworthy young lady from the country, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) don't like town girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is to wear myself out to please her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! and I won't go. O, if I could
live in a gay town as a lady should, and go my own ways, and do my own
doings, I'd give the wrinkled half of my life! Yes, reddleman, that
would I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Help me to get Thomasin happy, miss, and the chance shall be yours,''
 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chance--`tis no chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said proudly. <div class="bookquote">``What can a poor man like
you offer me, indeed?--I am going indoors. I have nothing more to say.
Don't your horses want feeding, or your reddlebags want mending, or
don't you want to find buyers for your goods, that you stay idling here
like this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn spoke not another word. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) turned away,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) might not see the hopeless disappointment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) face. The
mental clearness and power he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had found in this lonely girl had indeed
filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) manner with misgiving even from the first few minutes of
close quarters with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) youth and situation had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) to expect
a simplicity quite at the beck of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) method. But a system of inducement
which might have carried weaker country lasses along with it had merely
repelled Eustacia. As a rule, the word Budmouth meant fascination on
Egdon. That Royal port and watering place, if truly mirrored in
the minds of the heathfolk, must have combined, in a charming and
indescribable manner a Carthaginian bustle of building with Tarentine
luxuriousness and Baian health and beauty. Eustacia felt little less
extravagantly about the place; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would not sink her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) independence
to get there.

<p/>When Diggory Venn had gone quite away, Eustacia walked to the bank and
looked down the wild and picturesque vale towards the sun, which was
also in the direction of Wildeve's. The mist had now so far collapsed
that the tips of the trees and bushes around his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) house could just
be discerned, as if boring upwards through a vast white cobweb which
cloaked them from the day. There was no doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind was inclined
thitherward; indefinitely, fancifully--twining and untwining about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) as the single object within her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) horizon on which dreams might
crystallize. The man who had begun by being merely her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) amusement, and
would never have been more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hobby but for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skill in deserting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) at the right moments, was now again her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) desire. Cessation in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
love-making had revivified her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) love. Such feeling as Eustacia had idly
given to Wildeve was dammed into a flood by Thomasin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had used to
tease Wildeve, but that was before another had favoured him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). Often a
drop of irony into an indifferent situation renders the whole piquant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will never give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up--never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said impetuously.

<p/>The reddleman's hint that rumour might show her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to disadvantage had
no permanent terror for Eustacia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was as unconcerned at that
contingency as a goddess at a lack of linen. This did not originate in
inherent shamelessness, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) living too far from the world to feel
the impact of public opinion. Zenobia in the desert could hardly have
cared what was said about her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) at Rome. As far as social ethics were
concerned Eustacia approached the savage state, though in emotion she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
was all the while an epicure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had advanced to the secret recesses of
sensuousness, yet had hardly crossed the threshold of conventionality.




<p/>11--The Dishonesty of an Honest Woman


<p/>The reddleman had left Eustacia's presence with desponding views on
Thomasin's future happiness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) was awakened to the fact that one
other channel remained untried by seeing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) followed the way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>)
van, the form of Mrs. Yeobright slowly walking towards the Quiet Woman.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) went across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>); and could almost perceive in her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) anxious face
that this journey of hers to Wildeve was undertaken with the same object
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) own to Eustacia.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not conceal the fact. <div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman, <div class="bookquote">``you may as
well leave it alone, Mrs. Yeobright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I half think so myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But nothing else remains to be done
besides pressing the question upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to say a word first,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wildeve is
not the only man who has asked Thomasin to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>); and why should not
another have a chance? Mrs. Yeobright, I should be glad to marry your
niece and would have done it any time these last two years. There, now
it is out, and I have never told anybody before but herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright was not demonstrative, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes involuntarily glanced
towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) singular though shapely figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Looks are not everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman, noticing the glance.
<div class="bookquote">``There's many a calling that don't bring in so much as mine, if it comes
to money; and perhaps I am not so much worse off than Wildeve. There is
nobody so poor as these professional fellows who have failed; and if you
shouldn't like my redness--well, I am not red by birth, you know; I only
took to this business for a freak; and I might turn my hand to something
else in good time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you for your interest in my niece; but I fear
there would be objections. More than that, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) is devoted to this man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True; or I shouldn't have done what I have this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Otherwise there would be no pain in the case, and you would not see me
going to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house now. What was Thomasin's answer when you told her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) of
your feelings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) wrote that you would object to me; and other things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was in a measure right. You must not take this unkindly--I merely
state it as a truth. You have been good to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and we do not forget
it. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was unwilling on her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) own account to be your wife, that
settles the point without my wishes being concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But there is a difference between then and now, ma’am. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) is
distressed now, and I have thought that if you were to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) about
me, and think favourably of me yourself, there might be a chance of
winning her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) round, and getting her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) quite independent of this Wildeve's
backward and forward play, and his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) not knowing whether he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'ll have her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) or
no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Thomasin thinks, and I think with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>),
that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) ought to be Wildeve's wife, if she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) means to appear before the
world without a slur upon her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) name. If they marry soon, everybody will
believe that an accident did really prevent the wedding. If not, it may
cast a shade upon her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) character--at any rate make her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) ridiculous. In
short, if it is anyhow possible they must marry now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought that till half an hour ago. But, after all, why should her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
going off with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to Anglebury for a few hours do her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) any harm? Anybody
who knows how pure she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) is will feel any such thought to be quite
unjust. I have been trying this morning to help on this marriage with
Wildeve--yes, I, ma’am--in the belief that I ought to do it, because she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
was so wrapped up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). But I much question if I was right, after all.
However, nothing came of it. And now I offer myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright appeared disinclined to enter further into the question.
<div class="bookquote">``I fear I must go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I do not see that anything else can be
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) went on. But though this conversation did not divert Thomasin's
aunt from her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) purposed interview with Wildeve, it made a considerable
difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mode of conducting that interview. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) thanked God for
the weapon which the reddleman had put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) hands.

<p/>Wildeve was at home when she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) reached the inn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) silently
into the parlour, and closed the door. Mrs. Yeobright began--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought it my duty to call today. A new proposal has been made
to me, which has rather astonished me. It will affect Thomasin greatly;
and I have decided that it should at least be mentioned to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes? What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said civilly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, of course, in reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) future. You may not be aware that
another man has shown himself anxious to marry Thomasin. Now, though
I have not encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yet, I cannot conscientiously refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a
chance any longer. I don't wish to be short with you; but I must be fair
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is the man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve with surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One who has been in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) longer than she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has with you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) two years ago. At that time she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lately, and has asked me for permission to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
addresses to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) may not refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) twice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright declined to say. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a man Thomasin likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``and one whose constancy she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) respects at least. It seems to me that what
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) refused then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would be glad to get now. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is much annoyed at
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) awkward position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never once told me of this old lover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The gentlest women are not such fools as to show EVERY card.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wants him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must have him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is easy enough to say that; but you don't see the difficulty. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
wants her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) much more than she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wants him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>); and before I can encourage
anything of the sort I must have a clear understanding from you that
you will not interfere to injure an arrangement which I promote in the
belief that it is for the best. Suppose, when they are engaged, and
everything is smoothly arranged for their marriage, that you should step
between them and renew your suit? You might not win her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) back, but you
might cause much unhappiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I should do no such thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve <div class="bookquote">``But they are not
engaged yet. How do you know that Thomasin would accept him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a question I have carefully put to myself; and upon the whole
the probabilities are in favour of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in time. I flatter
myself that I have some influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is pliable, and I can be
strong in my recommendations of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in your disparagement of me at the same time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you may depend upon my not praising you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said drily. <div class="bookquote">``And
if this seems like manoeuvring, you must remember that her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) position is
peculiar, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has been hardly used. I shall also be helped in
making the match by her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own desire to escape from the humiliation of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
present state; and a woman's pride in these cases will lead her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a very
great way. A little managing may be required to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) round; but
I am equal to that, provided that you agree to the one thing
indispensable; that is, to make a distinct declaration that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is to
think no more of you as a possible husband. That will pique her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) into
accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly say that just now, Mrs. Yeobright. It is so sudden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so my whole plan is interfered with! It is very inconvenient
that you refuse to help my family even to the small extent of saying
distinctly you will have nothing to do with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve reflected uncomfortably. <div class="bookquote">``I confess I was not prepared for
this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) up if you wish, if it is
necessary. But I thought I might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have heard that before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mrs. Yeobright, don't let us disagree. Give me a fair time. I
don't want to stand in the way of any better chance she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) may have; only
I wish you had let me know earlier. I will write to you or call in a day
or two. Will that suffice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``provided you promise not to communicate with
Thomasin without my knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I promise that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said. And the interview then terminated, Mrs.
Yeobright returning homeward as she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had come.

<p/>By far the greatest effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) simple strategy on that day was, as
often happens, in a quarter quite outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) view when arranging it. In
the first place, her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) visit sent Wildeve the same evening after dark to
Eustacia's house at Mistover.

<p/>At this hour the lonely dwelling was closely blinded and shuttered from
the chill and darkness without. Wildeve's clandestine plan with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was
to take a little gravel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hand and hold it to the crevice at the
top of the window shutter, which was on the outside, so that it should
fall with a gentle rustle, resembling that of a mouse, between shutter
and glass. This precaution in attracting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) attention was to avoid
arousing the suspicions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather.

<p/>The soft words, <div class="bookquote">``I hear; wait for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>in Eustacia's voice from within
told him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was alone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) waited in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) customary manner by walking round the enclosure and
idling by the pool, for Wildeve was never asked into the house by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
proud though condescending mistress. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) showed no sign of coming out in
a hurry. The time wore on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) began to grow impatient. In the course
of twenty minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) appeared from round the corner, and advanced as if
merely taking an airing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not have kept me so long had you known what I come about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
said with bitterness. <div class="bookquote">``Still, you are worth waiting for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia. <div class="bookquote">``I did not know you were in trouble.
I too am gloomy enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not in trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is merely that affairs have come to
a head, and I must take a clear course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What course is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) asked with attentive interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And can you forget so soon what I proposed to you the other night? Why,
take you from this place, and carry you away with me abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not forgotten. But why have you come so unexpectedly to repeat
the question, when you only promised to come next Saturday? I thought I
was to have plenty of time to consider.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but the situation is different now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Explain to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to explain, for I may pain you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must know the reason of this hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is simply my ardour, dear Eustacia. Everything is smooth now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why are you so ruffled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not aware of it. All is as it should be. Mrs. Yeobright--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
is nothing to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had something to do with it! Come, I don't like

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) has nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) only says she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) wishes me to give up Thomasin
because another man is anxious to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). The woman, now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no
longer needs me, actually shows off!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>Wildeve's vexation has escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
in spite of himself.

<p/>Eustacia was silent a long while. <div class="bookquote">``You are in the awkward position of an
official who is no longer wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said in a changed tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems so. But I have not yet seen Thomasin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that irritates you. Don't deny it, Damon. You are actually nettled
by this slight from an unexpected quarter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you come to get me because you cannot get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). This is certainly a
new position altogether. I am to be a stop-gap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please remember that I proposed the same thing the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia again remained in a sort of stupefied silence. What curious
feeling was this coming over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)? Was it really possible that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
interest in Wildeve had been so entirely the result of antagonism that
the glory and the dream departed from the man with the first sound that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was no longer coveted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) rival? She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was, then, secure of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at
last. Thomasin no longer required him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What a humiliating victory!
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) best, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) thought; and yet--dared she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to murmur such
treacherous criticism ever so softly?--what was the man worth whom a
woman inferior to herself did not value? The sentiment which lurks more
or less in all animate nature--that of not desiring the undesired of
others--was lively as a passion in the supersubtle, epicurean heart of
Eustacia. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) social superiority over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), which hitherto had scarcely
ever impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), became unpleasantly insistent, and for the first
time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had stooped in loving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, darling, you agree?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it could be London, or even Budmouth, instead of America,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
murmured languidly. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I will think. It is too great a thing for me
to decide offhand. I wish I hated the heath less--or loved you more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can be painfully frank. You loved me a month ago warmly enough to
go anywhere with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you loved Thomasin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps that was where the reason lay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) returned, with almost a
sneer. <div class="bookquote">``I don't hate her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. The only thing is that you can no longer get her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come--no taunts, Eustacia, or we shall quarrel. If you don't agree to
go with me, and agree shortly, I shall go by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or try Thomasin again. Damon, how strange it seems that you could have
married her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) or me indifferently, and only have come to me because I

exclaimed against a man of that sort, and been quite wild; but it is all
past now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you go, dearest? Come secretly with me to Bristol, marry me, and
turn our backs upon this dog-hole of England for ever? Say Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to get away from here at almost any cost,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said with
weariness, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't like to go with you. Give me more time to
decide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I give you one more week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little longer, so that I may tell you decisively. I have to consider
so many things. Fancy Thomasin being anxious to get rid of you! I cannot
forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that. Say Monday week. I will be here precisely at this
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it be at Rainbarrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This is too near home; my
grandfather may be walking out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, dear. On Monday week at this time I will be at the Barrow.
Till then good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye. No, no, you must not touch me now. Shaking hands is enough
till I have made up my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) shadowy form till it had disappeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) placed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) forehead and breathed heavily; and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) rich,
romantic lips parted under that homely impulse--a yawn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was
immediately angry at having betrayed even to herself the possible
evanescence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) passion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could not admit at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
might have overestimated Wildeve, for to perceive his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mediocrity now was
to admit her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own great folly heretofore. And the discovery that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was
the owner of a disposition so purely that of the dog in the manger had
something in it which at first made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) ashamed.

<p/>The fruit of Mrs. Yeobright's diplomacy was indeed remarkable,
though not as yet of the kind she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had anticipated. It had appreciably
influenced Wildeve, but it was influencing Eustacia far more. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lover
was no longer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) an exciting man whom many women strove for, and
herself could only retain by striving with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a superfluity.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went indoors in that peculiar state of misery which is not exactly
grief, and which especially attends the dawnings of reason in the latter
days of an ill-judged, transient love. To be conscious that the end of
the dream is approaching, and yet has not absolutely come, is one of
the most wearisome as well as the most curious stages along the course
between the beginning of a passion and its end.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather had returned, and was busily engaged in pouring some
gallons of newly arrived rum into the square bottles of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) square
cellaret. Whenever these home supplies were exhausted he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would go to the
Quiet Woman, and, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) back to the fire, grog in hand, tell
remarkable stories of how he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had lived seven years under the waterline
of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) ship, and other naval wonders, to the natives, who hoped too
earnestly for a treat of ale from the teller to exhibit any doubts of
his (<font color='blue'><b>teller</b></font>) truth.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>teller</b></font>) had been there this evening. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have heard the Egdon
news, Eustacia?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>teller</b></font>) said, without looking up from the bottles. <div class="bookquote">``The
men have been talking about it at the Woman as if it were of national
importance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard none,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young Clym Yeobright, as they call him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>), is coming home next week to
spend Christmas with his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) is a fine fellow by this time, it
seems. I suppose you remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, true; he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) left before you came here. I well remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) as a

 (<font color='red'><b>the Comer</b></font>)</div><p/>BOOK TWO -- THE ARRIVAL




<p/>1--Tidings of the Comer


<p/>On the fine days at this time of the year, and earlier, certain
ephemeral operations were apt to disturb, in their trifling way, the
majestic calm of Egdon Heath. They were activities which, beside those
of a town, a village, or even a farm, would have appeared as the ferment
of stagnation merely, a creeping of the flesh of somnolence. But here,
away from comparisons, shut in by the stable hills, among which mere
walking had the novelty of pageantry, and where any man could imagine
himself to be Adam without the least difficulty, they attracted the
attention of every bird within eyeshot, every reptile not yet asleep,
and set the surrounding rabbits curiously watching from hillocks at a
safe distance.

<p/>The performance was that of bringing together and building into a stack
the furze faggots which Humphrey had been cutting for the captain's
use during the foregoing fine days. The stack was at the end of the
dwelling, and the men engaged in building it were Humphrey and Sam, the
old man looking on.

<p/>It was a fine and quiet afternoon, about three o’clock; but the winter
solstice having stealthily come on, the lowness of the sun caused the
hour to seem later than it actually was, there being little here to
remind an inhabitant that he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) must unlearn his (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) summer experience of the
sky as a dial. In the course of many days and weeks sunrise had advanced
its quarters from northeast to southeast, sunset had receded from
northwest to southwest; but Egdon had hardly heeded the change.

<p/>Eustacia was indoors in the dining-room, which was really more like a
kitchen, having a stone floor and a gaping chimney-corner. The air was
still, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lingered a moment here alone sounds of voices in
conversation came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) ears directly down the chimney. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) entered
the recess, and, listening, looked up the old irregular shaft, with its
cavernous hollows, where the smoke blundered about on its way to the
square bit of sky at the top, from which the daylight struck down with a
pallid glare upon the tatters of soot draping the flue as seaweed drapes
a rocky fissure.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remembered: the furze-stack was not far from the chimney, and the
voices were those of the workers.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather joined in the conversation. <div class="bookquote">``That lad ought never to
have left home. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father's occupation would have suited him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) best, and
the boy should have followed on. I don't believe in these new moves in
families. My father was a sailor, so was I, and so should my son have
been if I had had one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The place he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s been living at is Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey, ``and they tell
me `tis where the king's head was cut off years ago. My poor mother used
to tell me about that business. `Hummy,' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to say, `I was a young
maid then, and as I was at home ironing Mother's caps one afternoon the
parson came in and said, <div class="bookquote">``They've cut the king's head off, Jane; and
what `twill be next God knows.'''''

 (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good many of us knew as well as He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) before long,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain,
chuckling. <div class="bookquote">``I lived seven years under water on account of it in my
boyhood--in that damned surgery of the Triumph, seeing men brought down
to the cockpit with their legs and arms blown to Jericho... And so the
young man has settled in Paris. Manager to a diamond merchant, or some
such thing, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Manager</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, that's it. `Tis a blazing great business that he (<font color='blue'><b>Manager</b></font>) belongs to,
so I've heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Manager</b></font>) mother say--like a king's palace, as far as diments
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can well mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>Manager</b></font>) left home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam.

<p/>```Tis a good thing for the feller,'' said Humphrey. <div class="bookquote">``A sight of times
better to be selling diments than nobbling about here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must cost a good few shillings to deal at such a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good few indeed, my man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>replied the captain. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you may make
away with a deal of money and be neither drunkard nor glutton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say, too, that Clym Yeobright is become a real perusing man, with
the strangest notions about things. There, that's because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to
school early, such as the school was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strange notions, has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, there's too much of
that sending to school in these days! It only does harm. Every gatepost
and barn's door you come to is sure to have some bad word or other
chalked upon it by the young rascals--a woman can hardly pass for shame
sometimes. If they'd never been taught how to write they wouldn't have
been able to scribble such villainy. Their fathers couldn't do it, and
the country was all the better for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I should think, Cap’n, that Miss Eustacia had about as much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
head that comes from books as anybody about here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps if Miss Eustacia, too, had less romantic nonsense in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head
it would be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain shortly; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
walked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Sam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>observed Humphrey when the old man was gone, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) and Clym
Yeobright would make a very pretty pigeon-pair--hey? If they wouldn't
I'll be dazed! Both of one mind about niceties for certain, and learned
in print, and always thinking about high doctrine--there couldn't be a
better couple if they were made o' purpose. Clym's family is as good as
hers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) father was a farmer, that's true; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother was a sort
of lady, as we know. Nothing would please me better than to see them two
man and wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'd look very natty, arm-in-crook together, and their best clothes
on, whether or no, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s at all the well-favoured fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They would, Humphrey. Well, I should like to see the chap terrible much
after so many years. If I knew for certain when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was coming I'd stroll
out three or four miles to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) and help carry anything for’n;
though I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s altered from the boy he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) can talk
French as fast as a maid can eat blackberries; and if so, depend upon it
we who have stayed at home shall seem no more than scroff in his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming across the water to Budmouth by steamer, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but how he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s coming from Budmouth I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a bad trouble about his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) cousin Thomasin. I wonder such a
nice-notioned fellow as Clym likes to come home into it. What a
nunnywatch we were in, to be sure, when we heard they weren't married
at all, after singing to `em as man and wife that night! Be dazed if
I should like a relation of mine to have been made such a fool of by a
man. It makes the family look small.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Poor maid, her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heart has ached enough about it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) health is
suffering from it, I hear, for she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) will bide entirely indoors. We never
see her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) out now, scampering over the furze with a face as red as a rose,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) used to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) wouldn't have Wildeve now if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have? `Tis news to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>While the furze-gatherers had desultorily conversed thus Eustacia's
face gradually bent to the hearth in a profound reverie, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) toe
unconsciously tapping the dry turf which lay burning at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) feet.

<p/>The subject of their discourse had been keenly interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). A
young and clever man was coming into that lonely heath from, of all
contrasting places in the world, Paris. It was like a man coming from
heaven. More singular still, the heathmen had instinctively coupled her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
and this man together in their minds as a pair born for each other.

<p/>That five minutes of overhearing furnished Eustacia with visions enough
to fill the whole blank afternoon. Such sudden alternations from mental
vacuity do sometimes occur thus quietly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could never have believed
in the morning that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) colourless inner world would before night become
as animated as water under a microscope, and that without the arrival of
a single visitor. The words of Sam and Humphrey on the harmony between
the unknown and herself had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind the effect of the invading
Bard's prelude in the Castle of Indolence, at which myriads of
imprisoned shapes arose where had previously appeared the stillness of a
void.

<p/>Involved in these imaginings she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew nothing of time. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) became
conscious of externals it was dusk. The furze-rick was finished; the men
had gone home. Eustacia went upstairs, thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would take a
walk at this her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) usual time; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) determined that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) walk should be
in the direction of Blooms-End, the birthplace of young Yeobright and
the present home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bard</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no reason for walking elsewhere,
and why should she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not go that way? The scene of the daydream is
sufficient for a pilgrimage at nineteen. To look at the palings before
the Yeobrights' house had the dignity of a necessary performance.
Strange that such a piece of idling should have seemed an important
errand.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bonnet, and, leaving the house, descended the hill on the
side towards Blooms-End, where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walked slowly along the valley for a
distance of a mile and a half. This brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to a spot in which the
green bottom of the dale began to widen, the furze bushes to recede
yet further from the path on each side, till they were diminished to
an isolated one here and there by the increasing fertility of the soil.
Beyond the irregular carpet of grass was a row of white palings, which
marked the verge of the heath in this latitude. They showed upon the
dusky scene that they bordered as distinctly as white lace on velvet.
Behind the white palings was a little garden; behind the garden an old,
irregular, thatched house, facing the heath, and commanding a full view
of the valley. This was the obscure, removed spot to which was about
to return a man whose latter life had been passed in the French
capital--the centre and vortex of the fashionable world.




<p/>2--The People at Blooms-End Make Ready


<p/>All that afternoon the expected arrival of the subject of Eustacia's
ruminations created a bustle of preparation at Blooms-End. Thomasin had
been persuaded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) aunt, and by an instinctive impulse of loyalty
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cousin Clym, to bestir herself on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) account with an
alacrity unusual in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) during these most sorrowful days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) life. At
the time that Eustacia was listening to the rick-makers' conversation
on Clym's return, Thomasin was climbing into a loft over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) aunt's
fuelhouse, where the store-apples were kept, to search out the best and
largest of them for the coming holiday-time.

<p/>The loft was lighted by a semicircular hole, through which the pigeons
crept to their lodgings in the same high quarters of the premises; and
from this hole the sun shone in a bright yellow patch upon the figure of
the maiden as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knelt and plunged her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) naked arms into the soft brown
fern, which, from its abundance, was used on Egdon in packing away
stores of all kinds. The pigeons were flying about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head with the
greatest unconcern, and the face of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) aunt was just visible above
the floor of the loft, lit by a few stray motes of light, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stood
halfway up the ladder, looking at a spot into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was not climber
enough to venture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now a few russets, Tamsin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) used to like them almost as well as
ribstones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin turned and rolled aside the fern from another nook, where more
mellow fruit greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) with its ripe smell. Before picking them out
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stopped a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Clym, I wonder how your face looks now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, gazing
abstractedly at the pigeon-hole, which admitted the sunlight so directly
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) brown hair and transparent tissues that it almost seemed to
shine through her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) could have been dear to you in another way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright
from the ladder, <div class="bookquote">``this might have been a happy meeting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any use in saying what can do no good, Aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt, with some warmth. <div class="bookquote">``To thoroughly fill the air with
the past misfortune, so that other girls may take warning and keep clear
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face to the apples again. <div class="bookquote">``I am a warning to
others, just as thieves and drunkards and gamblers are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said in a
low voice. <div class="bookquote">``What a class to belong to! Do I really belong to them? `Tis
absurd! Yet why, Aunt, does everybody keep on making me think that I do,
by the way they behave towards me? Why don't people judge me by my acts?
Now, look at me as I kneel here, picking up these apples--do I look
like a lost woman?... I wish all good women were as good as I!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) added
vehemently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strangers don't see you as I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright; <div class="bookquote">``they judge from
false report. Well, it is a silly job, and I am partly to blame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How quickly a rash thing can be done!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) lips were
quivering, and tears so crowded themselves into her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could
hardly distinguish apples from fern as she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) continued industriously
searching to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) weakness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as you have finished getting the apples,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt said,
descending the ladder, <div class="bookquote">``come down, and we'll go for the holly. There is
nobody on the heath this afternoon, and you need not fear being
stared at. We must get some berries, or Clym will never believe in our
preparations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin came down when the apples were collected, and together they
went through the white palings to the heath beyond. The open hills were
airy and clear, and the remote atmosphere appeared, as it often appears
on a fine winter day, in distinct planes of illumination independently
toned, the rays which lit the nearer tracts of landscape streaming
visibly across those further off; a stratum of ensaffroned light was
imposed on a stratum of deep blue, and behind these lay still remoter
scenes wrapped in frigid grey.

<p/>They reached the place where the hollies grew, which was in a conical
pit, so that the tops of the trees were not much above the general level
of the ground. Thomasin stepped up into a fork of one of the bushes, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had done under happier circumstances on many similar occasions,
and with a small chopper that they had brought she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) began to lop off the
heavily berried boughs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't scratch your face,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) aunt, who stood at the edge of the
pit, regarding the girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) held on amid the glistening green and
scarlet masses of the tree. <div class="bookquote">``Will you walk with me to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) this
evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to. Else it would seem as if I had forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said
Thomasin, tossing out a bough. <div class="bookquote">``Not that that would matter much; I
belong to one man; nothing can alter that. And that man I must marry,
for my pride's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>began Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you think, `That weak girl--how is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) going to get a man to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chooses?' But let me tell you one thing, Aunt: Mr. Wildeve
is not a profligate man, any more than I am an improper woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) has
an unfortunate manner, and doesn't try to make people like him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) if they
don't wish to do it of their own accord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomasin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright quietly, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eye upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) niece,
<div class="bookquote">``do you think you deceive me in your defence of Mr. Wildeve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have long had a suspicion that your love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) has changed its
colour since you have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) not to be the saint you thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), and
that you act a part to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wished to marry me, and I wish to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I put it to you: would you at this present moment agree to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
wife if that had not happened to entangle you with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin looked into the tree and appeared much disturbed. <div class="bookquote">``Aunt,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said presently, <div class="bookquote">``I have, I think, a right to refuse to answer that
question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may think what you choose. I have never implied to you by word or
deed that I have grown to think otherwise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), and I never will. And
I shall marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) repeats his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) offer.

knows--something I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). I don't for a moment dispute that it is the
most proper thing for you to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). Much as I have objected to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
in bygone days, I agree with you now, you may be sure. It is the only
way out of a false position, and a very galling one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was standing in the way of another lover of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin, with round eyes, <div class="bookquote">``what DO you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be alarmed; it was my duty. I can say no more about it now, but
when it is over I will tell you exactly what I said, and why I said it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin was perforce content.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will keep the secret of my would-be marriage from Clym for the
present?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) next asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have given my word to. But what is the use of it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) must soon know
what has happened. A mere look at your face will show him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) that something
is wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin turned and regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt from the tree. <div class="bookquote">``Now, hearken to
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) delicate voice expanding into firmness by a force
which was other than physical. <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) nothing. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) finds out that I
am not worthy to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) cousin, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). But, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) loved me once, we
will not pain him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) by telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) my trouble too soon. The air is full of
the story, I know; but gossips will not dare to speak of it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) for
the first few days. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) closeness to me is the very thing that will
hinder the tale from reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) early. If I am not made safe from
sneers in a week or two I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>The earnestness with which Thomasin spoke prevented further objections.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt simply said, <div class="bookquote">``Very well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) should by rights have been told at
the time that the wedding was going to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) will never forgive you for
your secrecy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) will, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) knows it was because I wished to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), and
that I did not expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) home so soon. And you must not let me stand in
the way of your Christmas party. Putting it off would only make matters
worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall not. I do not wish to show myself beaten before all
Egdon, and the sport of a man like Wildeve. We have enough berries now,
I think, and we had better take them home. By the time we have decked
the house with this and hung up the mistletoe, we must think of starting
to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin came out of the tree, shook from her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) hair and dress the loose
berries which had fallen thereon, and went down the hill with her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt,
each woman bearing half the gathered boughs. It was now nearly four
o’clock, and the sunlight was leaving the vales. When the west grew red
the two relatives came again from the house and plunged into the heath
in a different direction from the first, towards a point in the distant
highway along which the expected man was to return.




<p/>3--How a Little Sound Produced a Great Dream


<p/>Eustacia stood just within the heath, straining her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes in the
direction of Mrs. Yeobright's house and premises. No light, sound, or
movement was perceptible there. The evening was chilly; the spot was
dark and lonely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) inferred that the guest had not yet come; and after
lingering ten or fifteen minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned again towards home.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had not far retraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) steps when sounds in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) betokened
the approach of persons in conversation along the same path. Soon their
heads became visible against the sky. They were walking slowly; and
though it was too dark for much discovery of character from aspect, the
gait of them showed that they were not workers on the heath. Eustacia
stepped a little out of the foot-track to let them pass. They were
two women and a man; and the voices of the women were those of Mrs.
Yeobright and Thomasin.

<p/>They went by her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), and at the moment of passing appeared to discern her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
dusky form. There came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) ears in a masculine voice, <div class="bookquote">``Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) murmured a reply, glided by them, and turned round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could not,
for a moment, believe that chance, unrequested, had brought into her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
presence the soul of the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had gone to inspect, the man without
whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) inspection would not have been thought of.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes to see them, but was unable. Such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
intentness, however, that it seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) ears were performing the
functions of seeing as well as hearing. This extension of power can
almost be believed in at such moments. The deaf Dr. Kitto was probably
under the influence of a parallel fancy when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) described his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body as
having become, by long endeavour, so sensitive to vibrations that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
gained the power of perceiving by it as by ears.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could follow every word that the ramblers uttered. They were talking
no secrets. They were merely indulging in the ordinary vivacious chat of
relatives who have long been parted in person though not in soul. But
it was not to the words that Eustacia listened; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could not even
have recalled, a few minutes later, what the words were. It was to the
alternating voice that gave out about one-tenth of them--the voice that
had wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) good night. Sometimes this throat uttered Yes, sometimes
it uttered No; sometimes it made inquiries about a time worn denizen
of the place. Once it surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) notions by remarking upon the
friendliness and geniality written in the faces of the hills around.

<p/>The three voices passed on, and decayed and died out upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) ear. Thus
much had been granted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); and all besides withheld. No event could have
been more exciting. During the greater part of the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had
been entrancing herself by imagining the fascination which must attend
a man come direct from beautiful Paris--laden with its atmosphere,
familiar with its charms. And this man had greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>With the departure of the figures the profuse articulations of the women
wasted away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) memory; but the accents of the other stayed on.
Was there anything in the voice of Mrs. Yeobright's son--for Clym
it was--startling as a sound? No; it was simply comprehensive. All
emotional things were possible to the speaker of that <div class="bookquote">``good night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker night</b></font>)</div>Eustacia's imagination supplied the rest--except the solution to one
riddle. What COULD the tastes of that man be who saw friendliness and
geniality in these shaggy hills?

<p/>On such occasions as this a thousand ideas pass through a highly charged
woman's head; and they indicate themselves on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; but the changes,
though actual, are minute. Eustacia's features went through a rhythmical
succession of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) glowed; remembering the mendacity of the
imagination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) flagged; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) freshened; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) fired; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
cooled again. It was a cycle of aspects, produced by a cycle of visions.

<p/>Eustacia entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own house; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was excited. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather was
enjoying himself over the fire, raking about the ashes and exposing the
red-hot surface of the turves, so that their lurid glare irradiated the
chimney-corner with the hues of a furnace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it that we are never friendly with the Yeobrights?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said,
coming forward and stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) soft hands over the warmth. <div class="bookquote">``I wish we
were. They seem to be very nice people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be hanged if I know why,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain. <div class="bookquote">``I liked the old man well
enough, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as rough as a hedge. But you would never have
cared to go there, even if you might have, I am well sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your town tastes would find them far too countrified. They sit in the
kitchen, drink mead and elder-wine, and sand the floor to keep it clean.
A sensible way of life; but how would you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought Mrs. Yeobright was a ladylike woman? A curate's daughter, was
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was obliged to live as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband did; and I suppose
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has taken kindly to it by this time. Ah, I recollect that I once
accidentally offended her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and I have never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>That night was an eventful one to Eustacia's brain, and one which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
hardly ever forgot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) dreamt a dream; and few human beings, from
Nebuchadnezzar to the Swaffham tinker, ever dreamt a more remarkable
one. Such an elaborately developed, perplexing, exciting dream was
certainly never dreamed by a girl in Eustacia's situation before. It had
as many ramifications as the Cretan labyrinth, as many fluctuations as
the northern lights, as much colour as a parterre in June, and was as
crowded with figures as a coronation. To Queen Scheherazade the dream
might have seemed not far removed from commonplace; and to a girl just
returned from all the courts of Europe it might have seemed not more
than interesting. But amid the circumstances of Eustacia's life it was
as wonderful as a dream could be.

<p/>There was, however, gradually evolved from its transformation scenes a
less extravagant episode, in which the heath dimly appeared behind the
general brilliancy of the action. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was dancing to wondrous music, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) partner was the man in silver armour who had accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) through
the previous fantastic changes, the visor of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) helmet being closed.
The mazes of the dance were ecstatic. Soft whispering came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) ear
from under the radiant helmet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) felt like a woman in Paradise.
Suddenly these two wheeled out from the mass of dancers, dived into one
of the pools of the heath, and came out somewhere into an iridescent
hollow, arched with rainbows. <div class="bookquote">``It must be here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the voice by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
side, and blushingly looking up she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) removing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) casque to kiss
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). At that moment there was a cracking noise, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure fell into
fragments like a pack of cards.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cried aloud. <div class="bookquote">``O that I had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia awoke. The cracking had been that of the window shutter
downstairs, which the maid-servant was opening to let in the day, now
slowly increasing to Nature's meagre allowance at this sickly time of
the year. <div class="bookquote">``O that I had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said again. ```Twas meant for
Mr. Yeobright!''

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) became cooler she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) perceived that many of the phases of the
dream had naturally arisen out of the images and fancies of the day
before. But this detracted little from its interest, which lay in the
excellent fuel it provided for newly kindled fervour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was at the
modulating point between indifference and love, at the stage called
<div class="bookquote">``having a fancy for.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>It occurs once in the history of the most gigantic
passions, and it is a period when they are in the hands of the weakest
will.

<p/>The perfervid woman was by this time half in love with a vision. The
fantastic nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passion, which lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as an intellect,
raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as a soul. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had a little more self-control she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would have attenuated the emotion to nothing by sheer reasoning, and so
have killed it off. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had a little less pride she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have
gone and circumambulated the Yeobrights' premises at Blooms-End at any
maidenly sacrifice until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But Eustacia did neither of
these things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) acted as the most exemplary might have acted, being
so influenced; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) took an airing twice or thrice a day upon the Egdon
hills, and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes employed.

<p/>The first occasion passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) did not come that way.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) promenaded a second time, and was again the sole wanderer there.

<p/>The third time there was a dense fog; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) looked around, but without
much hope. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) had been walking within twenty yards of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
could not have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>).

<p/>At the fourth attempt to encounter him (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) it began to rain in torrents, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned back.

<p/>The fifth sally was in the afternoon; it was fine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remained out
long, walking to the very top of the valley in which Blooms-End lay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
saw the white paling about half a mile off; but he (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) did not appear. It
was almost with heart-sickness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) came home and with a sense of
shame at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) weakness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) resolved to look for the man from Paris no
more.

<p/>But Providence is nothing if not coquettish; and no sooner had Eustacia
formed this resolve than the opportunity came which, while sought, had
been entirely withholden.




<p/>4--Eustacia Is Led on to an Adventure


<p/>In the evening of this last day of expectation, which was the
twenty-third of December, Eustacia was at home alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had passed
the recent hour in lamenting over a rumour newly come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) ears--that
Yeobright's visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother was to be of short duration, and would
end some time the next week. <div class="bookquote">``Naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said to herself. A man
in the full swing of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) activities in a gay city could not afford to
linger long on Egdon Heath. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would behold face to face the owner
of the awakening voice within the limits of such a holiday was most
unlikely, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) were to haunt the environs of his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) mother's house
like a robin, to do which was difficult and unseemly.

<p/>The customary expedient of provincial girls and men in such
circumstances is churchgoing. In an ordinary village or country town
one can safely calculate that, either on Christmas day or the Sunday
contiguous, any native home for the holidays, who has not through age or
ennui lost the appetite for seeing and being seen, will turn up in some
pew or other, shining with hope, self-consciousness, and new clothes.
Thus the congregation on Christmas morning is mostly a Tussaud
collection of celebrities who have been born in the neighbourhood.
Hither the mistress, left neglected at home all the year, can steal and
observe the development of the returned lover who has forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and
think as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) watches him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) prayer book that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) may throb with
a renewed fidelity when novelties have lost their charm. And hither
a comparatively recent settler like Eustacia may betake herself to
scrutinize the person of a native son who left home before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) advent
upon the scene, and consider if the friendship of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) parents be worth
cultivating during his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) next absence in order to secure a knowledge of
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) next return.

<p/>But these tender schemes were not feasible among the scattered
inhabitants of Egdon Heath. In name they were parishioners, but
virtually they belonged to no parish at all. People who came to these
few isolated houses to keep Christmas with their friends remained
in their friends' chimney-corners drinking mead and other comforting
liquors till they left again for good and all. Rain, snow, ice, mud
everywhere around, they did not care to trudge two or three miles to
sit wet-footed and splashed to the nape of their necks among those
who, though in some measure neighbours, lived close to the church, and
entered it clean and dry. Eustacia knew it was ten to one that Clym
Yeobright would go to no church at all during his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) few days of leave, and
that it would be a waste of labour for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to go driving the pony and
gig over a bad road in hope to see him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) there.

<p/>It was dusk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was sitting by the fire in the dining-room or
hall, which they occupied at this time of the year in preference to the
parlour, because of its large hearth, constructed for turf-fires, a
fuel the captain was partial to in the winter season. The only visible
articles in the room were those on the window-sill, which showed their
shapes against the low sky, the middle article being the old hourglass,
and the other two a pair of ancient British urns which had been dug
from a barrow near, and were used as flowerpots for two razor-leaved
cactuses. Somebody knocked at the door. The servant was out; so was her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>)
grandfather. The person, after waiting a minute, came in and tapped at
the door of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, Cap’n Vye, will you let us--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia arose and went to the door. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot allow you to come in so
boldly. You should have waited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The cap’n said I might come in without any fuss,''  (<font color='red'><b>a lad</b></font>)</div>was answered in a
lad's pleasant voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, did he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia more gently. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please will your grandfather lend us his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) fuelhouse to try over our
parts in, tonight at seven o’clock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, are you one of the Egdon mummers for this year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss. The cap’n used to let the old mummers practise here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it. Yes, you may use the fuelhouse if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia
languidly.

<p/>The choice of Captain Vye's fuelhouse as the scene of rehearsal was
dictated by the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) dwelling was nearly in the centre of the
heath. The fuelhouse was as roomy as a barn, and was a most desirable
place for such a purpose. The lads who formed the company of players
lived at different scattered points around, and by meeting in this spot
the distances to be traversed by all the comers would be about equally
proportioned.

<p/>For mummers and mumming Eustacia had the greatest contempt. The mummers
themselves were not afflicted with any such feeling for their art,
though at the same time they were not enthusiastic. A traditional
pastime is to be distinguished from a mere revival in no more striking
feature than in this, that while in the revival all is excitement and
fervour, the survival is carried on with a stolidity and absence of
stir which sets one wondering why a thing that is done so perfunctorily
should be kept up at all. Like Balaam and other unwilling prophets, the
agents seem moved by an inner compulsion to say and do their allotted
parts whether they will or no. This unweeting manner of performance is
the true ring by which, in this refurbishing age, a fossilized survival
may be known from a spurious reproduction.

<p/>The piece was the well-known play of Saint George, and all who were
behind the scenes assisted in the preparations, including the women of
each household. Without the co-operation of sisters and sweethearts the
dresses were likely to be a failure; but on the other hand, this class
of assistance was not without its drawbacks. The girls could never be
brought to respect tradition in designing and decorating the armour;
they insisted on attaching loops and bows of silk and velvet in any
situation pleasing to their taste. Gorget, gusset, basinet, cuirass,
gauntlet, sleeve, all alike in the view of these feminine eyes were
practicable spaces whereon to sew scraps of fluttering colour.

<p/>It might be that Joe, who fought on the side of Christendom, had a
sweetheart, and that Jim, who fought on the side of the Moslem, had
one likewise. During the making of the costumes it would come to the
knowledge of Joe's sweetheart that Jim's was putting brilliant silk
scallops at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) lover's surcoat, in addition to the
ribbons of the visor, the bars of which, being invariably formed of
coloured strips about half an inch wide hanging before the face, were
mostly of that material. Joe's sweetheart straight-way placed brilliant
silk on the scallops of the hem in question, and, going a little
further, added ribbon tufts to the shoulder pieces. Jim's, not to be
outdone, would affix bows and rosettes everywhere.

<p/>The result was that in the end the Valiant Soldier, of the Christian
army, was distinguished by no peculiarity of accoutrement from the
Turkish Knight; and what was worse, on a casual view Saint George
himself might be mistaken for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) deadly enemy, the Saracen. The guisers
themselves, though inwardly regretting this confusion of persons, could
not afford to offend those by whose assistance they so largely profited,
and the innovations were allowed to stand.

<p/>There was, it is true, a limit to this tendency to uniformity. The
Leech or Doctor preserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) character intact--his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) darker habiliments,
peculiar hat, and the bottle of physic slung under his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) arm, could never
be mistaken. And the same might be said of the conventional figure of
Father Christmas, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gigantic club, an older man, who accompanied
the band as general protector in long night journeys from parish to
parish, and was bearer of the purse.

<p/>Seven o’clock, the hour of the rehearsal, came round, and in a short
time Eustacia could hear voices in the fuelhouse. To dissipate in some
trifling measure her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) abiding sense of the murkiness of human life she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
went to the <div class="bookquote">``linhay''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>or lean-to shed, which formed the root-store of
their dwelling and abutted on the fuelhouse. Here was a small rough hole
in the mud wall, originally made for pigeons, through which the interior
of the next shed could be viewed. A light came from it now; and Eustacia
stepped upon a stool to look in upon the scene.

<p/>On a ledge in the fuelhouse stood three tall rushlights and by the
light of them seven or eight lads were marching about, haranguing, and
confusing each other, in endeavours to perfect themselves in the play.
Humphrey and Sam, the furze-and turf-cutters, were there looking on, so
also was Timothy Fairway, who leant against the wall and prompted
the boys from memory, interspersing among the set words remarks and
anecdotes of the superior days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) and others were the Egdon
mummers-elect that these lads were now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, ye be as well up to it as ever ye will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Not that
such mumming would have passed in our time. Harry as the Saracen should
strut a bit more, and John needn't holler his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) inside out. Beyond that
perhaps you'll do. Have you got all your clothes ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall by Monday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your first outing will be Monday night, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. At Mrs. Yeobright's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Yeobright's. What makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) want to see ye? I should think a
middle-aged woman was tired of mumming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got up a bit of a party, because `tis the first Christmas that
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son Clym has been home for a long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, to be sure--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) party! I am going myself. I almost forgot
it, upon my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia's face flagged. There was to be a party at the Yeobrights';
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), naturally, had nothing to do with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was a stranger to all
such local gatherings, and had always held them as scarcely appertaining
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sphere. But had she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) been going, what an opportunity would have
been afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) of seeing the man whose influence was penetrating her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
like summer sun! To increase that influence was coveted excitement; to
cast it off might be to regain serenity; to leave it as it stood was
tantalizing.

<p/>The lads and men prepared to leave the premises, and Eustacia returned
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) fireside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was immersed in thought, but not for long. In a
few minutes the lad Charley, who had come to ask permission to use the
place, returned with the key to the kitchen. Eustacia heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), and
opening the door into the passage said, <div class="bookquote">``Charley, come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad was surprised. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) entered the front room not without blushing;
for he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), like many, had felt the power of this girl's face and form.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pointed to a seat by the fire, and entered the other side of the
chimney-corner herself. It could be seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face that whatever
motive she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have had in asking the youth indoors would soon appear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which part do you play, Charley--the Turkish Knight, do you not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>inquired the beauty, looking across the smoke of the fire to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) on the
other side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, the Turkish Knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) replied diffidently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is yours a long part?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine speeches, about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you repeat them to me? If so I should like to hear them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lad</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad smiled into the glowing turf and began--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here come I, a Turkish Knight,
Who learnt in Turkish land to fight,''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lad</b></font>)</div><p/>continuing the discourse throughout the scenes to the concluding
catastrophe of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fall by the hand of Saint George.

<p/>Eustacia had occasionally heard the part recited before. When the lad
ended she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) began, precisely in the same words, and ranted on without
hitch or divergence till she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) too reached the end. It was the same thing,
yet how different. Like in form, it had the added softness and finish
of a Raffaelle after Perugino, which, while faithfully reproducing the
original subject, entirely distances the original art.

<p/>Charley's eyes rounded with surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you be a clever lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
said, in admiration. <div class="bookquote">``I've been three weeks learning mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard it before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) quietly observed. <div class="bookquote">``Now, would you do
anything to please me, Charley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd do a good deal, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you let me play your part for one night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, miss! But your woman's gown--you couldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can get boy's clothes--at least all that would be wanted besides the
mumming dress. What should I have to give you to lend me your things,
to let me take your place for an hour or two on Monday night, and on no
account to say a word about who or what I am? You would, of course, have
to excuse yourself from playing that night, and to say that somebody--a
cousin of Miss Vye's--would act for you. The other mummers have never
spoken to me in their lives so that it would be safe enough; and if it
were not, I should not mind. Now, what must I give you to agree to this?
Half a crown?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The youth</b></font>)</div><p/>The youth shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) head

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Five shillings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The youth</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) head again. <div class="bookquote">``Money won't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said, brushing the iron
head of the firedog with the hollow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will, then, Charley?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia in a disappointed tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what you forbade me at the Maypoling, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>murmured the lad,
without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and still stroking the firedog's head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia, with a little more hauteur. <div class="bookquote">``You wanted to join
hands with me in the ring, if I recollect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half an hour of that, and I'll agree, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia regarded the youth steadfastly. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was three years younger
than herself, but apparently not backward for his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) age. <div class="bookquote">``Half an hour of
what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) guessed what.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Holding your hand in mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was silent. <div class="bookquote">``Make it a quarter of an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Eustacia--I will, if I may kiss it too. A quarter of an hour.
And I'll swear to do the best I can to let you take my place without
anybody knowing. Don't you think somebody might know your tongue, miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is possible. But I will put a pebble in my mouth to make is less
likely. Very well; you shall be allowed to have my hand as soon as you
bring the dress and your sword and staff. I don't want you any longer
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley departed, and Eustacia felt more and more interest in life.
Here was something to do: here was some one to see, and a charmingly
adventurous way to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``want of an
object to live for--that's all is the matter with me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia's manner was as a rule of a slumberous sort, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) passions being
of the massive rather than the vivacious kind. But when aroused she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
would make a dash which, just for the time, was not unlike the move of a
naturally lively person.

<p/>On the question of recognition she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was somewhat indifferent. By the
acting lads themselves she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was not likely to be known. With the guests
who might be assembled she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was hardly so secure. Yet detection, after
all, would be no such dreadful thing. The fact only could be detected,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) true motive never. It would be instantly set down as the passing
freak of a girl whose ways were already considered singular. That she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was doing for an earnest reason what would most naturally be done in
jest was at any rate a safe secret.


<p/>The next evening Eustacia stood punctually at the fuelhouse door,
waiting for the dusk which was to bring Charley with the trappings.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather was at home tonight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would be unable to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
confederate indoors.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) appeared on the dark ridge of heathland, like a fly on a Negro,
bearing the articles with him (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>), and came up breathless with his (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are the things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) whispered, placing them upon the threshold.
<div class="bookquote">``And now, Miss Eustacia--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The payment. It is quite ready. I am as good as my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) leant against the door-post, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand. Charley took it
in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) own with a tenderness beyond description, unless it was like
that of a child holding a captured sparrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's a glove on it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said in a deprecating way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been walking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, miss!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--it is hardly fair.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) pulled off the glove, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
bare hand.

<p/>They stood together minute after minute, without further speech, each
looking at the blackening scene, and each thinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own
thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I won't use it all up tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley devotedly, when
six or eight minutes had been passed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) caressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``May I
have the other few minutes another time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) without the least emotion. <div class="bookquote">``But it must be over
in a week. Now, there is only one thing I want you to do--to wait while
I put on the dress, and then to see if I do my part properly. But let me
look first indoors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) vanished for a minute or two, and went in. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather was
safely asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Now, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, on returning, <div class="bookquote">``walk
down the garden a little way, and when I am ready I'll call you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley walked and waited, and presently heard a soft whistle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
returned to the fuelhouse door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you whistle, Miss Vye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) in Eustacia's voice from a back quarter.
<div class="bookquote">``I must not strike a light till the door is shut, or it may be seen
shining. Push your hat into the hole through to the wash-house, if you
can feel your way across.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley did as commanded, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) struck the light revealing herself
to be changed in sex, brilliant in colours, and armed from top to toe.
Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) quailed a little under Charley's vigorous gaze, but whether
any shyness at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) male attire appeared upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) countenance could not
be seen by reason of the strips of ribbon which used to cover the face
in mumming costumes, representing the barred visor of the mediaeval
helmet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It fits pretty well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, looking down at the white overalls,
<div class="bookquote">``except that the tunic, or whatever you call it, is long in the sleeve.
The bottom of the overalls I can turn up inside. Now pay attention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia then proceeded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) delivery, striking the sword against the
staff or lance at the minatory phrases, in the orthodox mumming
manner, and strutting up and down. Charley seasoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) admiration with
criticism of the gentlest kind, for the touch of Eustacia's hand yet
remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now for your excuse to the others,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Where do you meet
before you go to Mrs. Yeobright's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We thought of meeting here, miss, if you have nothing to say against
it. At eight o’clock, so as to get there by nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Well, you of course must not appear. I will march in about five
minutes late, ready-dressed, and tell them that you can't come. I have
decided that the best plan will be for you to be sent somewhere by me,
to make a real thing of the excuse. Our two heath-croppers are in the
habit of straying into the meads, and tomorrow evening you can go and
see if they are gone there. I'll manage the rest. Now you may leave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss. But I think I'll have one minute more of what I am owed, if
you don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, and counted on till she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) reached seven or eight
minutes. Hand and person she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) then withdrew to a distance of several
feet, and recovered some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) old dignity. The contract completed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
raised between them a barrier impenetrable as a wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, `tis all gone; and I didn't mean quite all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said, with a
sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had good measure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), turning away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss. Well, `tis over, and now I'll get home-along.''




 (<font color='red'><b>the mummers</b></font>)</div><p/>5--Through the Moonlight


<p/>The next evening the mummers were assembled in the same spot, awaiting
the entrance of the Turkish Knight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty minutes after eight by the Quiet Woman, and Charley not come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes past by Blooms-End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wants ten minutes to, by Grandfer Cantle's watch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And `tis five minutes past by the captain's clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Egdon/Egdon Heath</b></font>)</div><p/>On Egdon there was no absolute hour of the day. The time at any moment
was a number of varying doctrines professed by the different hamlets,
some of them having originally grown up from a common root, and then
become divided by secession, some having been alien from the beginning.
West Egdon believed in Blooms-End time, East Egdon in the time of the
Quiet Woman Inn. Grandfer Cantle's watch had numbered many followers in
years gone by, but since he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) had grown older faiths were shaken. Thus,
the mummers having gathered hither from scattered points each came with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) own tenets on early and late; and they waited a little longer as a
compromise.

<p/>Eustacia had watched the assemblage through the hole; and seeing that
now was the proper moment to enter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went from the <div class="bookquote">``linhay''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
boldly pulled the bobbin of the fuelhouse door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather was safe
at the Quiet Woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Charley at last! How late you be, Charley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis not Charley,<div class="bookquote">'' said the Turkish Knight from within his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) visor. ```Tis
a cousin of Miss Vye's, come to take Charley's place from curiosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
was obliged to go and look for the heath-croppers that have got into the
meads, and I agreed to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) place, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) couldn't come back
here again tonight. I know the part as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) graceful gait, elegant figure, and dignified manner in general won
the mummers to the opinion that they had gained by the exchange, if the
newcomer were perfect in his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) part.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't matter--if you be not too young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Saint</b></font>)</div>said Saint George.
Eustacia's voice had sounded somewhat more juvenile and fluty than
Charley's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know every word of it, I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia decisively. Dash
being all that was required to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) triumphantly through, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
adopted as much as was necessary. <div class="bookquote">``Go ahead, lads, with the try-over.
I'll challenge any of you to find a mistake in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mummers</b></font>)</div><p/>The play was hastily rehearsed, whereupon the other mummers were
delighted with the new knight. They extinguished the candles at
half-past eight, and set out upon the heath in the direction of Mrs.
Yeobright's house at Bloom's-End.

<p/>There was a slight hoarfrost that night, and the moon, though not
more than half full, threw a spirited and enticing brightness upon the
fantastic figures of the mumming band, whose plumes and ribbons rustled
in their walk like autumn leaves. Their path was not over Rainbarrow
now, but down a valley which left that ancient elevation a little to
the east. The bottom of the vale was green to a width of ten yards or
thereabouts, and the shining facets of frost upon the blades of grass
seemed to move on with the shadows of those they surrounded. The masses
of furze and heath to the right and left were dark as ever; a mere
half-moon was powerless to silver such sable features as theirs.

<p/>Half-an-hour of walking and talking brought them to the spot in the
valley where the grass riband widened and led down to the front of the
house. At sight of the place Eustacia who had felt a few passing doubts
during her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) walk with the youths, again was glad that the adventure had
been undertaken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had come out to see a man who might possibly have
the power to deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) soul from a most deadly oppression. What was
Wildeve? Interesting, but inadequate. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would see a sufficient
hero tonight.

<p/>As they drew nearer to the front of the house the mummers became aware
that music and dancing were briskly flourishing within. Every now
and then a long low note from the serpent, which was the chief wind
instrument played at these times, advanced further into the heath than
the thin treble part, and reached their ears alone; and next a more
than usual loud tread from a dancer would come the same way. With nearer
approach these fragmentary sounds became pieced together, and were found
to be the salient points of the tune called <div class="bookquote">``Nancy's Fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was there, of course. Who was she (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) danced with? Perhaps some
unknown woman, far beneath herself in culture, was by the most subtle
of lures sealing his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) fate this very instant. To dance with a man is to
concentrate a twelvemonth's regulation fire upon him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) in the fragment of
an hour. To pass to courtship without acquaintance, to pass to marriage
without courtship, is a skipping of terms reserved for those alone
who tread this royal road. She (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) would see how his (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) heart lay by keen
observation of them all.

<p/>The enterprising lady followed the mumming company through the gate
in the white paling, and stood before the open porch. The house was
encrusted with heavy thatchings, which dropped between the upper
windows; the front, upon which the moonbeams directly played, had
originally been white; but a huge pyracanth now darkened the greater
portion.

<p/>It became at once evident that the dance was proceeding immediately
within the surface of the door, no apartment intervening. The brushing
of skirts and elbows, sometimes the bumping of shoulders, could be heard
against the very panels. Eustacia, though living within two miles of
the place, had never seen the interior of this quaint old habitation.
Between Captain Vye and the Yeobrights there had never existed much
acquaintance, the former having come as a stranger and purchased the
long-empty house at Mistover Knap not long before the death of Mrs.
Yeobright's husband; and with that event and the departure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son
such friendship as had grown up became quite broken off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there no passage inside the door, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>asked Eustacia as they
stood within the porch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad who played the Saracen. <div class="bookquote">``The door opens right upon
the front sitting-room, where the spree's going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that we cannot open the door without stopping the dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it. Here we must bide till they have done, for they always bolt
the back door after dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They won't be much longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>said Father Christmas.

<p/>This assertion, however, was hardly borne out by the event. Again the
instruments ended the tune; again they recommenced with as much fire and
pathos as if it were the first strain. The air was now that one without
any particular beginning, middle, or end, which perhaps, among all the
dances which throng an inspired fiddler's fancy, best conveys the
idea of the interminable--the celebrated <div class="bookquote">``Devil's Dream.''  (<font color='red'><b>an fiddler</b></font>)</div>The fury of
personal movement that was kindled by the fury of the notes could be
approximately imagined by these outsiders under the moon, from the
occasional kicks of toes and heels against the door, whenever the whirl
round had been of more than customary velocity.

<p/>The first five minutes of listening was interesting enough to the
mummers. The five minutes extended to ten minutes, and these to a
quarter of an hour; but no signs of ceasing were audible in the lively
<div class="bookquote">``Dream.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The bumping against the door, the laughter, the stamping, were
all as vigorous as ever, and the pleasure in being outside lessened
considerably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does Mrs. Yeobright give parties of this sort?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>Eustacia asked, a
little surprised to hear merriment so pronounced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) bettermost parlour-parties. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)'s asked the plain
neighbours and workpeople without drawing any lines, just to give `em a
good supper and such like. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) wait upon the folks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/>```Tis the last strain, I think,'' said Saint George, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ear to the
panel. ``A young man and woman have just swung into this corner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `Ah, the pity; `tis over for us this time, my own.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Knight</b></font>)</div>said the Turkish Knight, stamping, and taking from the wall
the conventional lance that each of the mummers carried. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) boots being
thinner than those of the young men, the hoar had damped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) feet and
made them cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my song `tis another ten minutes for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valiant</b></font>)</div>said the Valiant
Soldier, looking through the keyhole as the tune modulated into another
without stopping. <div class="bookquote">``Grandfer Cantle is standing in this corner, waiting
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twon't be long; `tis a six-handed reel,'' said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not go in, dancing or no? They sent for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Saracen</b></font>)</div>said the Saracen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia authoritatively, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) paced smartly up
and down from door to gate to warm herself. <div class="bookquote">``We should burst into the
middle of them and stop the dance, and that would be unmannerly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thinks himself somebody because he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has had a bit more schooling than
we,''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may go to the deuce!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/>There was a whispered conversation between three or four of them, and
one turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you tell us one thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, not without gentleness. <div class="bookquote">``Be you
Miss Vye? We think you must be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may think what you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia slowly. <div class="bookquote">``But honourable
lads will not tell tales upon a lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll say nothing, miss. That's upon our honour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied.

<p/>At this moment the fiddles finished off with a screech, and the
serpent emitted a last note that nearly lifted the roof. When, from the
comparative quiet within, the mummers judged that the dancers had taken
their seats, Father Christmas advanced, lifted the latch, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
head inside the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, the mummers, the mummers!''  (<font color='red'><b>guests</b></font>)</div>cried several guests at once. <div class="bookquote">``Clear a
space for the mummers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div><p/>Humpbacked Father Christmas then made a complete entry, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
huge club, and in a general way clearing the stage for the actors
proper, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) informed the company in smart verse that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was come,
welcome or welcome not; concluding his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) speech with

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make room, make room, my gallant boys,
And give us space to rhyme;
We've come to show Saint George's play,
Upon this Christmas time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The guests were now arranging themselves at one end of the room, the
fiddler was mending a string, the serpent-player was emptying his (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>)
mouthpiece, and the play began. First of those outside the Valiant
Soldier entered, in the interest of Saint George--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here come I, the Valiant Soldier;
Slasher is my name'' (<font color='red'><b>George</b></font>)</div>;

<p/>and so on. This speech concluded with a challenge to the infidel, at the
end of which it was Eustacia's duty to enter as the Turkish Knight.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), with the rest who were not yet on, had hitherto remained in the
moonlight which streamed under the porch. With no apparent effort or
backwardness she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) came in, beginning--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here come I, a Turkish Knight,
Who learnt in Turkish land to fight;
I'll fight this man with courage bold:
If his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood's hot I'll make it cold!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>During her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) declamation Eustacia held her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head erect, and spoke as
roughly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could, feeling pretty secure from observation. But the
concentration upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) part necessary to prevent discovery, the newness
of the scene, the shine of the candles, and the confusing effect upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) vision of the ribboned visor which hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) features, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
absolutely unable to perceive who were present as spectators. On the
further side of a table bearing candles she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could faintly discern faces,
and that was all.

<p/>Meanwhile Jim Starks as the Valiant Soldier had come forward, and, with
a glare upon the Turk, replied--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If, then, thou art that Turkish Knight,
Draw out thy sword, and let us fight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Turk</b></font>)</div><p/>And fight they did; the issue of the combat being that the Valiant
Soldier was slain by a preternaturally inadequate thrust from Eustacia,
Jim, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) ardour for genuine histrionic art, coming down like a log
upon the stone floor with force enough to dislocate his (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) shoulder. Then,
after more words from the Turkish Knight, rather too faintly delivered,
and statements that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>)'d fight Saint George and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) crew, Saint
George himself magnificently entered with the well-known flourish--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here come I, Saint George, the valiant man,
With naked sword and spear in hand,
Who fought the dragon and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to the slaughter,
And by this won fair Sabra, the King of Egypt's
daughter;
What mortal man would dare to stand
Before me with my sword in hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the lad who had first recognized Eustacia; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) now, as
the Turk, replied with suitable defiance, and at once began the combat,
the young fellow took especial care to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) sword as gently as
possible. Being wounded, the Knight fell upon one knee, according to the
direction. The Doctor now entered, restored the Knight by giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>)
a draught from the bottle which he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) carried, and the fight was again
resumed, the Turk sinking by degrees until quite overcome--dying as hard
in this venerable drama as he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) is said to do at the present day.

<p/>This gradual sinking to the earth was, in fact, one reason why Eustacia
had thought that the part of the Turkish Knight, though not the
shortest, would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) best. A direct fall from upright to horizontal,
which was the end of the other fighting characters, was not an elegant
or decorous part for a girl. But it was easy to die like a Turk, by a
dogged decline.

<p/>Eustacia was now among the number of the slain, though not on the
floor, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had managed to sink into a sloping position against
the clock-case, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head was well elevated. The play proceeded
between Saint George, the Saracen, the Doctor, and Father Christmas;
and Eustacia, having no more to do, for the first time found leisure to
observe the scene round, and to search for the form that had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
hither.




<p/>6--The Two Stand Face to Face


<p/>The room had been arranged with a view to the dancing, the large oak
table having been moved back till it stood as a breastwork to the
fireplace. At each end, behind, and in the chimney-corner were grouped
the guests, many of them being warm-faced and panting, among whom
Eustacia cursorily recognized some well-to-do persons from beyond the
heath. Thomasin, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had expected, was not visible, and Eustacia
recollected that a light had shone from an upper window when they were
outside--the window, probably, of Thomasin's room. A nose, chin, hands,
knees, and toes projected from the seat within the chimney opening,
which members she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) found to unite in the person of Grandfer Cantle, Mrs.
Yeobright's occasional assistant in the garden, and therefore one of the
invited. The smoke went up from an Etna of peat in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>), played
round the notches of the chimney-crook, struck against the salt-box, and
got lost among the flitches.

<p/>Another part of the room soon riveted her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) gaze. At the other side of the
chimney stood the settle, which is the necessary supplement to a fire so
open that nothing less than a strong breeze will carry up the smoke. It
is, to the hearths of old-fashioned cavernous fireplaces, what the east
belt of trees is to the exposed country estate, or the north wall to
the garden. Outside the settle candles gutter, locks of hair wave, young
women shiver, and old men sneeze. Inside is Paradise. Not a symptom of a
draught disturbs the air; the sitters' backs are as warm as their faces,
and songs and old tales are drawn from the occupants by the comfortable
heat, like fruit from melon plants in a frame.

<p/>It was, however, not with those who sat in the settle that Eustacia was
concerned. A face showed itself with marked distinctness against the
dark-tanned wood of the upper part. The owner, who was leaning against
the settle's outer end, was Clement Yeobright, or Clym, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clement</b></font>) was called
here; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew it could be nobody else. The spectacle constituted an
area of two feet in Rembrandt's intensest manner. A strange power in the
lounger's appearance lay in the fact that, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) whole figure was
visible, the observer's eye was only aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) face.

<p/>To one of middle age the countenance was that of a young man, though a
youth might hardly have seen any necessity for the term of immaturity.
But it was really one of those faces which convey less the idea of
so many years as its age than of so much experience as its store. The
number of their years may have adequately summed up Jared, Mahalaleel,
and the rest of the antediluvians, but the age of a modern man is to be
measured by the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) history.

<p/>The face was well shaped, even excellently. But the mind within
was beginning to use it as a mere waste tablet whereon to trace its
idiosyncrasies as they developed themselves. The beauty here visible
would in no long time be ruthlessly over-run by its parasite, thought,
which might just as well have fed upon a plainer exterior where there
was nothing it could harm. Had Heaven preserved Yeobright from a wearing
habit of meditation, people would have said, <div class="bookquote">``A handsome man.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>Had
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain unfolded under sharper contours they would have said, <div class="bookquote">``A
thoughtful man.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But an inner strenuousness was preying upon an outer
symmetry, and they rated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look as singular.

<p/>Hence people who began by beholding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ended by perusing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance was overlaid with legible meanings. Without being
thought-worn he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yet had certain marks derived from a perception of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
surroundings, such as are not unfrequently found on men at the end of
the four or five years of endeavour which follow the close of placid
pupilage. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) already showed that thought is a disease of flesh, and
indirectly bore evidence that ideal physical beauty is incompatible
with emotional development and a full recognition of the coil of things.
Mental luminousness must be fed with the oil of life, even though there
is already a physical need for it; and the pitiful sight of two demands
on one supply was just showing itself here.

<p/>When standing before certain men the philosopher regrets that thinkers
are but perishable tissue, the artist that perishable tissue has to
think. Thus to deplore, each from his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) point of view, the mutually
destructive interdependence of spirit and flesh would have been
instinctive with these in critically observing Yeobright.

<p/>As for his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) look, it was a natural cheerfulness striving against
depression from without, and not quite succeeding. The look suggested
isolation, but it revealed something more. As is usual with bright
natures, the deity that lies ignominiously chained within an ephemeral
human carcase shone out of him (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>) like a ray.

<p/>The effect upon Eustacia was palpable. The extraordinary pitch of
excitement that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had reached beforehand would, indeed, have caused
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to be influenced by the most commonplace man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was troubled at
Yeobright's presence.

<p/>The remainder of the play ended--the Saracen's head was cut off, and
Saint George stood as victor. Nobody commented, any more than they would
have commented on the fact of mushrooms coming in autumn or snowdrops
in spring. They took the piece as phlegmatically as did the actors
themselves. It was a phase of cheerfulness which was, as a matter of
course, to be passed through every Christmas; and there was no more to
be said.

<p/>They sang the plaintive chant which follows the play, during which all
the dead men rise to their feet in a silent and awful manner, like the
ghosts of Napoleon's soldiers in the Midnight Review. Afterwards the
door opened, and Fairway appeared on the threshold, accompanied by
Christian and another. They had been waiting outside for the conclusion
of the play, as the players had waited for the conclusion of the dance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright; and Clym went forward to
welcome them. <div class="bookquote">``How is it you are so late? Grandfer Cantle has been here
ever so long, and we thought you'd have come with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as you live so
near one another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I should have come earlier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fairway</b></font>)</div>Mr. Fairway said and paused to
look along the beam of the ceiling for a nail to hang his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) hat on; but,
finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) accustomed one to be occupied by the mistletoe, and all
the nails in the walls to be burdened with bunches of holly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) at
last relieved himself of the hat by ticklishly balancing it between the
candle-box and the head of the clock-case. <div class="bookquote">``I should have come earlier,
ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fairway</b></font>) resumed, with a more composed air, <div class="bookquote">``but I know what parties
be, and how there's none too much room in folks' houses at such times,
so I thought I wouldn't come till you'd got settled a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I thought so too, Mrs. Yeobright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``but
Father there was so eager that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had no manners at all, and left home
almost afore `twas dark. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) `twas barely decent in a' old man to
come so oversoon; but words be wind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Klk! I wasn't going to bide waiting about, till half the game was over!
I'm as light as a kite when anything's going on!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>crowed Grandfer Cantle
from the chimneyseat.

<p/>Fairway had meanwhile concluded a critical gaze at Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``Now,
you may not believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) said to the rest of the room, <div class="bookquote">``but I should
never have knowed this gentleman if I had met him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) anywhere off his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'th--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s altered so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You too have altered, and for the better, I think Timothy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said
Yeobright, surveying the firm figure of Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master Yeobright, look me over too. I have altered for the better,
haven't I, hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, rising and placing himself
something above half a foot from Clym's eye, to induce the most
searching criticism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure we will,''  (<font color='red'><b>jerks</b></font>)</div>said Fairway, taking the candle and moving it over
the surface of the Grandfer's countenance, the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) scrutiny
irradiating himself with light and pleasant smiles, and giving himself
jerks of juvenility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't changed much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there's any difference, Grandfer is younger,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>appended Fairway
decisively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet not my own doing, and I feel no pride in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the pleased
ancient. <div class="bookquote">``But I can't be cured of my vagaries; them I plead guilty to.
Yes, Master Cantle always was that, as we know. But I am nothing by the
side of you, Mister Clym.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor any o' us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey, in a low rich tone of admiration, not
intended to reach anybody's ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, there would have been nobody here who could have stood as
decent second to him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), or even third, if I hadn't been a soldier in the
Bang-up Locals -LRB-as we was called for our smartness-RRB-,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer
Cantle. <div class="bookquote">``And even as `tis we all look a little scammish beside him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). But
in the year four `twas said there wasn't a finer figure in the whole
South Wessex than I, as I looked when dashing past the shop-winders with
the rest of our company on the day we ran out o' Budmouth because it was
thoughted that Boney had landed round the point. There was I, straight
as a young poplar, wi' my firelock, and my bagnet, and my spatterdashes,
and my stock sawing my jaws off, and my accoutrements sheening like
the seven stars! Yes, neighbours, I was a pretty sight in my soldiering
days. You ought to have seen me in four!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) mother's side where Master Clym's figure comes from, bless
ye,'' said Timothy. <div class="bookquote">``I know'd her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) brothers well. Longer coffins were
never made in the whole country of South Wessex, and `tis said that poor

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Coffins, where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>inquired Christian, drawing nearer. <div class="bookquote">``Have the ghost of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. Don't let your mind so mislead your ears, Christian; and be a
man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div>said Timothy reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian. <div class="bookquote">``But now I think o't my shadder last night
seemed just the shape of a coffin. What is it a sign of when your
shade's like a coffin, neighbours? It can't be nothing to be afeared of,
I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afeared, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Grandfer. <div class="bookquote">``Faith, I was never afeard of nothing
except Boney, or I shouldn't ha' been the soldier I was. Yes, `tis a
thousand pities you didn't see me in four!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mummers</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time the mummers were preparing to leave; but Mrs. Yeobright
stopped them by asking them to sit down and have a little supper. To
this invitation Father Christmas, in the name of them all, readily
agreed.

<p/>Eustacia was happy in the opportunity of staying a little longer.
The cold and frosty night without was doubly frigid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). But the
lingering was not without its difficulties. Mrs. Yeobright, for want
of room in the larger apartment, placed a bench for the mummers halfway
through the pantry door, which opened from the sitting-room. Here they
seated themselves in a row, the door being left open--thus they were
still virtually in the same apartment. Mrs. Yeobright now murmured a few
words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son, who crossed the room to the pantry door, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
head against the mistletoe as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) passed, and brought the mummers beef
and bread, cake pastry, mead, and elder-wine, the waiting being done by
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, that the little maid-servant might sit as guest. The
mummers doffed their helmets, and began to eat and drink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will surely have some?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Knight</b></font>)</div>said Clym to the Turkish Knight, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>)
stood before that warrior, tray in hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had refused, and still sat
covered, only the sparkle of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes being visible between the ribbons
which covered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>replied Eustacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)'s quite a youngster,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Saracen</b></font>)</div>said the Saracen apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``and you
must excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)'s not one of the old set, but have jined us because
t'other couldn't come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Saracen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) will take something?''  (<font color='red'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)</div>persisted Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``Try a glass of mead
or elder-wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you had better try that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Saracen</b></font>)</div>said the Saracen. <div class="bookquote">``It will keep the cold
out going home-along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Though Eustacia could not eat without uncovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could
drink easily enough beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) disguise. The elder-wine was accordingly
accepted, and the glass vanished inside the ribbons.

<p/>At moments during this performance Eustacia was half in doubt about
the security of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) position; yet it had a fearful joy. A series of
attentions paid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and yet not to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) but to some imaginary person,
by the first man she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had ever been inclined to adore, complicated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) emotions indescribably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
exceptional in this scene, partly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had determined to love
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), chiefly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was in desperate need of loving somebody
after wearying of Wildeve. Believing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) must love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in spite of
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had been influenced after the fashion of the second Lord
Lyttleton and other persons, who have dreamed that they were to die on a
certain day, and by stress of a morbid imagination have actually brought
about that event. Once let a maiden admit the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) being
stricken with love for someone at a certain hour and place, and the
thing is as good as done.

<p/>Did anything at this moment suggest to Yeobright the sex of the creature
whom that fantastic guise inclosed, how extended was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) scope both in
feeling and in making others feel, and how far her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) compass transcended
that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) companions in the band? When the disguised Queen of Love
appeared before Aeneas a preternatural perfume accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) presence
and betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) quality. If such a mysterious emanation ever was
projected by the emotions of an earthly woman upon their object, it must
have signified Eustacia's presence to Yeobright now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
wistfully, then seemed to fall into a reverie, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) were forgetting
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) observed. The momentary situation ended, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) passed on, and
Eustacia sipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) wine without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) drank. The man for
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had pre-determined to nourish a passion went into the small
room, and across it to the further extremity.

<p/>The mummers, as has been stated, were seated on a bench, one end of
which extended into the small apartment, or pantry, for want of space
in the outer room. Eustacia, partly from shyness, had chosen the midmost
seat, which thus commanded a view of the interior of the pantry as well
as the room containing the guests. When Clym passed down the pantry her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
eyes followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the gloom which prevailed there. At the remote
end was a door which, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was about to open it for himself, was
opened by somebody within; and light streamed forth.

<p/>The person was Thomasin, with a candle, looking anxious, pale, and
interesting. Yeobright appeared glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``That's right, Tamsie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said heartily, as though recalled to himself
by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you have decided to come down. I am glad of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush--no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I only came to speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not join us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot. At least I would rather not. I am not well enough, and we
shall have plenty of time together now you are going to be home a good
long holiday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't nearly so pleasant without you. Are you really ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a little, my old cousin--here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, playfully sweeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
hand across her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Mother should have asked somebody else to be present tonight,
perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, indeed. I merely stepped down, Clym, to ask you--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) through the doorway into the private room beyond, and,
the door closing, Eustacia and the mummer who sat next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), the only
other witness of the performance, saw and heard no more.

<p/>The heat flew to Eustacia's head and cheeks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) instantly guessed that
Clym, having been home only these two or three days, had not as yet
been made acquainted with Thomasin's painful situation with regard to
Wildeve; and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) living there just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had been living before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) left home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) naturally suspected nothing. Eustacia felt a wild
jealousy of Thomasin on the instant. Though Thomasin might possibly have
tender sentiments towards another man as yet, how long could they be
expected to last when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was shut up here with this interesting and
travelled cousin of hers? There was no knowing what affection might not
soon break out between the two, so constantly in each other's society,
and not a distracting object near. Clym's boyish love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) might have
languished, but it might easily be revived again.

<p/>Eustacia was nettled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own contrivances. What a sheer waste of
herself to be dressed thus while another was shining to advantage! Had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) known the full effect of the encounter she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would have moved heaven
and earth to get here in a natural manner. The power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face all
lost, the charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) emotions all disguised, the fascinations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
coquetry denied existence, nothing but a voice left to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had a
sense of the doom of Echo. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody here respects me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had
overlooked the fact that, in coming as a boy among other boys, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
would be treated as a boy. The slight, though of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own causing, and
self-explanatory, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was unable to dismiss as unwittingly shown, so
sensitive had the situation made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>Women have done much for themselves in histrionic dress. To look far
below those who, like a certain fair personator of Polly Peachum early
in the last century, and another of Lydia Languish early in this, -LRB-1-RRB-
have won not only love but ducal coronets into the bargain, whole shoals
of them have reached to the initial satisfaction of getting love almost
whence they would. But the Turkish Knight was denied even the chance
of achieving this by the fluttering ribbons which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) dared not brush
aside.

<p/>-LRB-1-RRB- Written in 1877.

<p/>Yeobright returned to the room without his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) cousin. When within two or
three feet of Eustacia he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) stopped, as if again arrested by a thought.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) looked another way, disconcerted, and wondered
how long this purgatory was to last. After lingering a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>)
passed on again.

<p/>To court their own discomfiture by love is a common instinct with
certain perfervid women. Conflicting sensations of love, fear, and shame
reduced Eustacia to a state of the utmost uneasiness. To escape was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
great and immediate desire. The other mummers appeared to be in no
hurry to leave; and murmuring to the lad who sat next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
preferred waiting for them outside the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) moved to the door as
imperceptibly as possible, opened it, and slipped out.

<p/>The calm, lone scene reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went forward to the palings and
leant over them, looking at the moon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had stood thus but a little
time when the door again opened. Expecting to see the remainder of the
band Eustacia turned; but no--Clym Yeobright came out as softly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
had done, and closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) advanced and stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have an odd opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and
should like to ask you a question. Are you a woman--or am I wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) eyes lingered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) with great interest. <div class="bookquote">``Do girls often play as
mummers now? They never used to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To get excitement and shake off depression,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said in low tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What depressed you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a cause of depression a good many have to put up with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A long silence. <div class="bookquote">``And do you find excitement?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Clym at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At this moment, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are vexed at being discovered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; though I thought I might be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would gladly have asked you to our party had I known you wished to
come. Have I ever been acquainted with you in my youth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you come in again, and stay as long as you like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I wish not to be further recognized.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are safe with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After remaining in thought a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
added gently, <div class="bookquote">``I will not intrude upon you longer. It is a strange way
of meeting, and I will not ask why I find a cultivated woman playing
such a part as this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not volunteer the reason which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) seemed to hope for, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) good night, going thence round to the back of the house,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) walked up and down by himself for some time before re-
entering.

<p/>Eustacia, warmed with an inner fire, could not wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) companions
after this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) flung back the ribbons from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face, opened the
gate, and at once struck into the heath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not hasten along. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
grandfather was in bed at this hour, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) so frequently walked upon
the hills on moonlight nights that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) took no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) comings and
goings, and, enjoying himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) own way, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to do likewise.
A more important subject than that of getting indoors now engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).
Yeobright, if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had the least curiosity, would infallibly discover her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
name. What then? She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) first felt a sort of exultation at the way in
which the adventure had terminated, even though at moments between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) exultations she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was abashed and blushful. Then this consideration
recurred to chill her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>): What was the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) exploit? She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was at
present a total stranger to the Yeobright family. The unreasonable
nimbus of romance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had encircled that man might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
misery. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) allow herself to become so infatuated with a
stranger? And to fill the cup of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sorrow there would be Thomasin,
living day after day in inflammable proximity to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had just
learnt that, contrary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) first belief, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was going to stay at home
some considerable time.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) reached the wicket at Mistover Knap, but before opening it she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
turned and faced the heath once more. The form of Rainbarrow stood above
the hills, and the moon stood above Rainbarrow. The air was charged with
silence and frost. The scene reminded Eustacia of a circumstance which
till that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had totally forgotten. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had promised to meet
Wildeve by the Barrow this very night at eight, to give a final answer
to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pleading for an elopement.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) herself had fixed the evening and the hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had probably come to
the spot, waited there in the cold, and been greatly disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, so much the better--it did not hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said serenely.
Wildeve had at present the rayless outline of the sun through smoked
glass, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could say such things as that with the greatest facility.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remained deeply pondering; and Thomasin's winning manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
cousin arose again upon Eustacia's mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been married to Damon before this!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would if it hadn't been for me! If I had only known--if I had only
known!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia once more lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) deep stormy eyes to the moonlight, and,
sighing that tragic sigh of hers which was so much like a shudder,
entered the shadow of the roof. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) threw off her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) trappings in the
outhouse, rolled them up, and went indoors to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) chamber.




<p/>7--A Coalition between Beauty and Oddness


<p/>The old captain's prevailing indifference to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) granddaughter's
movements left her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) free as a bird to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) own courses; but it so
happened that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) did take upon himself the next morning to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) why
she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) had walked out so late.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only in search of events, Grandfather,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) said, looking out of the
window with that drowsy latency of manner which discovered so much force
behind it whenever the trigger was pressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Search of events--one would think you were one of the bucks I knew at
one-and-twenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is lonely here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better. If I were living in a town my whole time would be
taken up in looking after you. I fully expected you would have been home
when I returned from the Woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't conceal what I did. I wanted an adventure, and I went with the
mummers. I played the part of the Turkish Knight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, never? Ha, ha! Good gad! I didn't expect it of you, Eustacia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my first performance, and it certainly will be my last. Now I
have told you--and remember it is a secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. But, Eustacia, you never did--ha! ha! Dammy, how `twould
have pleased me forty years ago! But remember, no more of it, my girl.
You may walk on the heath night or day, as you choose, so that you don't
bother me; but no figuring in breeches again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need have no fear for me, Grandpapa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the conversation ceased, Eustacia's moral training never exceeding
in severity a dialogue of this sort, which, if it ever became profitable
to good works, would be a result not dear at the price. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) thoughts
soon strayed far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own personality; and, full of a passionate and
indescribable solicitude for one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was not even a name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
went forth into the amplitude of tanned wild around her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), restless as
Ahasuerus the Jew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was about half a mile from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) residence when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) beheld a sinister redness arising from a ravine a little way in
advance--dull and lurid like a flame in sunlight and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) guessed it to
signify Diggory Venn.

<p/>When the farmers who had wished to buy in a new stock of reddle during
the last month had inquired where Venn was to be found, people replied,
<div class="bookquote">``On Egdon Heath.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>Day after day the answer was the same. Now, since
Egdon was populated with heath-croppers and furze-cutters rather than
with sheep and shepherds, and the downs where most of the latter were
to be found lay some to the north, some to the west of Egdon, his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>)
reason for camping about there like Israel in Zin was not apparent. The
position was central and occasionally desirable. But the sale of reddle
was not Diggory's primary object in remaining on the heath, particularly
at so late a period of the year, when most travellers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) class had
gone into winter quarters.

<p/>Eustacia looked at the lonely man. Wildeve had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) at their last
meeting that Venn had been thrust forward by Mrs. Yeobright as one ready
and anxious to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) place as Thomasin's betrothed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) figure
was perfect, his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) face young and well outlined, his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) eye bright, his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
intelligence keen, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) position one which he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) could readily better if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) chose. But in spite of possibilities it was not likely that Thomasin
would accept this Ishmaelitish creature while she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had a cousin like
Yeobright at her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) elbow, and Wildeve at the same time not absolutely
indifferent. Eustacia was not long in guessing that poor Mrs. Yeobright,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) niece's future, had mentioned this lover to
stimulate the zeal of the other. Eustacia was on the side of the
Yeobrights now, and entered into the spirit of the aunt's desire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cap of
hareskin, and apparently bearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) no ill-will from recollection of
their last meeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, reddleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, hardly troubling to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
heavily shaded eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I did not know you were so near. Is your
van here too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) elbow towards a hollow in which a dense brake of
purple-stemmed brambles had grown to such vast dimensions as almost to
form a dell. Brambles, though churlish when handled, are kindly shelter
in early winter, being the latest of the deciduous bushes to lose their
leaves.

<p/>The roof and chimney of Venn's caravan showed behind the tracery and
tangles of the brake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remain near this part?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) asked with more interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have business here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not altogether the selling of reddle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has nothing to do with that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has to do with Miss Yeobright?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face seemed to ask for an armed peace, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) therefore said
frankly, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss; it is on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On account of your approaching marriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn flushed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) stain. <div class="bookquote">``Don't make sport of me, Miss Vye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was thus convinced that the reddleman was a mere pis aller in Mrs.
Yeobright's mind; one, moreover, who had not even been informed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
promotion to that lowly standing. <div class="bookquote">``It was a mere notion of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
said quietly; and was about to pass by without further speech, when,
looking round to the right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) saw a painfully well-known figure
serpentining upwards by one of the little paths which led to the top
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) stood. Owing to the necessary windings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) course his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) back
was at present towards them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) glanced quickly round; to escape that
man there was only one way. Turning to Venn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Would you allow
me to rest a few minutes in your van? The banks are damp for sitting
on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, miss; I'll make a place for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) behind the dell of brambles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) wheeled dwelling
into which Venn mounted, placing the three-legged stool just within the
door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the best I can do for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said, stepping down and retiring
to the path, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) resumed the smoking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) pipe as he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) walked up
and down.

<p/>Eustacia bounded into the vehicle and sat on the stool, ensconced from
view on the side towards the trackway. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) heard the brushing of
other feet than the reddleman's, a not very friendly <div class="bookquote">``Good day''
 (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman a</b></font>)</div>uttered by two men in passing each other, and then the dwindling of the
foot-fall of one of them in a direction onwards. Eustacia stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
neck forward till she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) caught a glimpse of a receding back and shoulders;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) felt a wretched twinge of misery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew not why. It was the
sickening feeling which, if the changed heart has any generosity at all
in its composition, accompanies the sudden sight of a once-loved one who
is beloved no more.

<p/>When Eustacia descended to proceed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) way the reddleman came near.
<div class="bookquote">``That was Mr. Wildeve who passed, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said slowly, and expressed
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to feel vexed at having been sitting
unseen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) coming up the hill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>replied Eustacia. <div class="bookquote">``Why should
you tell me that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>It was a bold question, considering the reddleman's
knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) past love; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) undemonstrative manner had power to
repress the opinions of those she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) treated as remote from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear that you can ask it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman bluntly.
<div class="bookquote">``And, now I think of it, it agrees with what I saw last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--what was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>Eustacia wished to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), but wished to know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wildeve stayed at Rainbarrow a long time waiting for a lady who
didn't come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You waited too, it seems?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I always do. I was glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) disappointed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) will be there
again tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be again disappointed. The truth is, reddleman, that that lady, so
far from wishing to stand in the way of Thomasin's marriage with Mr.
Wildeve, would be very glad to promote it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn felt much astonishment at this avowal, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) did not show it
clearly; that exhibition may greet remarks which are one remove from
expectation, but it is usually withheld in complicated cases of two
removes and upwards. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that Mr. Wildeve will come to Rainbarrow again
tonight?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) say to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)'s in a regular temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia looked for a moment what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) felt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) murmured, lifting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) deep dark eyes anxiously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I wish I knew what to do. I don't
want to be uncivil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>); but I don't wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) again; and I have
some few little things to return to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you choose to send `em by me, miss, and a note to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) that you
wish to say no more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), I'll take it for you quite privately. That
would be the most straightforward way of letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) know your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia. <div class="bookquote">``Come towards my house, and I will bring it
out to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went on, and as the path was an infinitely small parting in the
shaggy locks of the heath, the reddleman followed exactly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) trail.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) saw from a distance that the captain was on the bank sweeping the
horizon with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) telescope; and bidding Venn to wait where he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) stood she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
entered the house alone.

<p/>In ten minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) returned with a parcel and a note, and said, in
placing them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``Why are you so ready to take these for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you ask that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you think to serve Thomasin in some way by it. Are you as
anxious as ever to help on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn was a little moved. <div class="bookquote">``I would sooner have married her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
said in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``But what I feel is that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) cannot be happy
without him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) I will do my duty in helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), as a man
ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia looked curiously at the singular man who spoke thus. What
a strange sort of love, to be entirely free from that quality of
selfishness which is frequently the chief constituent of the passion,
and sometimes its only one! The reddleman's disinterestedness was so
well deserving of respect that it overshot respect by being barely
comprehended; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) almost thought it absurd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we are both of one mind at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Venn gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``But if you would tell me, miss, why you
take such an interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), I should be easier. It is so sudden and
strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia appeared at a loss. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you that, reddleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
said coldly.

<p/>Venn said no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) pocketed the letter, and, bowing to Eustacia, went
away.

<p/>Rainbarrow had again become blended with night when Wildeve ascended the
long acclivity at its base. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) reaching the top a shape grew up from
the earth immediately behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). It was that of Eustacia's emissary.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) slapped Wildeve on the shoulder. The feverish young inn-keeper and
ex-engineer started like Satan at the touch of Ithuriel's spear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The meeting is always at eight o’clock, at this place,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn, <div class="bookquote">``and
here we are--we three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We three?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, looking quickly round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you, and I, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). This is she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) held up the letter and
parcel.

<p/>Wildeve took them wonderingly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite see what this means,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``How do you come here? There must be some mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be cleared from your mind when you have read the letter.
Lanterns for one.''  (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div>The reddleman struck a light, kindled an inch of
tallow-candle which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had brought, and sheltered it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, discerning by the candle-light an obscure
rubicundity of person in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``You are the reddleman I saw on
the hill this morning--why, you are the man who--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please read the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had come from the other one I shouldn't have been surprised,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>murmured Wildeve as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) opened the letter and read. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face grew
serious.


<p/>TO MR. WILDEVE.

<p/>After some thought I have decided once and for all that we must hold
no further communication. The more I consider the matter the more I am
convinced that there must be an end to our acquaintance. Had you been
uniformly faithful to me throughout these two years you might now have
some ground for accusing me of heartlessness; but if you calmly consider
what I bore during the period of your desertion, and how I passively put
up with your courtship of another without once interfering, you will, I
think, own that I have a right to consult my own feelings when you come
back to me again. That these are not what they were towards you may,
perhaps, be a fault in me, but it is one which you can scarcely reproach
me for when you remember how you left me for Thomasin.

<p/>The little articles you gave me in the early part of our friendship are
returned by the bearer of this letter. They should rightly have been
sent back when I first heard of your engagement to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).

<p/>EUSTACIA.



<p/>By the time that Wildeve reached her (<font color='blue'><b>EUSTACIA</b></font>) name the blankness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
had read the first half of the letter intensified to mortification. <div class="bookquote">``I
am made a great fool of, one way and another,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said pettishly. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you know what is in this letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman hummed a tune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you answer me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>asked Wildeve warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ru-um-tum-tum,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>sang the reddleman.

<p/>Wildeve stood looking on the ground beside Venn's feet, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) allowed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) eyes to travel upwards over Diggory's form, as illuminated by the
candle, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) head and face. <div class="bookquote">``Ha-ha! Well, I suppose I deserve it,
considering how I have played with them both,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said at last, as much
to himself as to Venn. <div class="bookquote">``But of all the odd things that ever I knew, the
oddest is that you should so run counter to your own interests as to
bring this to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My interests?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. `Twas your interest not to do anything which would send me
courting Thomasin again, now she (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) has accepted you--or something like it.
Mrs. Yeobright says you are to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). `Tisn't true, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord! I heard of this before, but didn't believe it. When did she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve began humming as the reddleman had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Venn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ru-um-tum-tum,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sang Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Lord--how we can imitate!''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Venn contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``I'll have this
out. I'll go straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Diggory withdrew with an emphatic step, Wildeve's eye passing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
form in withering derision, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) were no more than a heath-cropper.
When the reddleman's figure could no longer be seen, Wildeve himself
descended and plunged into the rayless hollow of the vale.

<p/>To lose the two women--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) who had been the well-beloved of both--was too
ironical an issue to be endured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) could only decently save himself
by Thomasin; and once he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) became her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) husband, Eustacia's repentance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
thought, would set in for a long and bitter term. It was no wonder that
Wildeve, ignorant of the new man at the back of the scene, should have
supposed Eustacia to be playing a part. To believe that the letter was
not the result of some momentary pique, to infer that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) really gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) up to Thomasin, would have required previous knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
transfiguration by that man's influence. Who was to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had
grown generous in the greediness of a new passion, that in coveting one
cousin she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was dealing liberally with another, that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eagerness to
appropriate she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) gave way?

<p/>Full of this resolve to marry in haste, and wring the heart of the proud
girl, Wildeve went his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) way.

<p/>Meanwhile Diggory Venn had returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) van, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) stood looking
thoughtfully into the stove. A new vista was opened up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>). But,
however promising Mrs. Yeobright's views of him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) might be as a candidate
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) niece's hand, one condition was indispensable to the favour of
Thomasin herself, and that was a renunciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) present wild mode
of life. In this he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) saw little difficulty.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) could not afford to wait till the next day before seeing Thomasin and
detailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) speedily plunged himself into toilet operations,
pulled a suit of cloth clothes from a box, and in about twenty minutes
stood before the van-lantern as a reddleman in nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) face, the
vermilion shades of which were not to be removed in a day. Closing the
door and fastening it with a padlock, Venn set off towards Blooms-End.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had reached the white palings and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) hand upon the gate when
the door of the house opened, and quickly closed again. A female form
had glided in. At the same time a man, who had seemingly been standing
with the woman in the porch, came forward from the house till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
face to face with Venn. It was Wildeve again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Man alive, you've been quick at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Diggory sarcastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you slow, as you will find,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
voice, <div class="bookquote">``you may as well go back again now. I've claimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), and got
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). Good night, reddleman!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Thereupon Wildeve walked away.

<p/>Venn's heart sank within him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>), though it had not risen unduly high.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) stood leaning over the palings in an indecisive mood for nearly a
quarter of an hour. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) went up the garden path, knocked, and asked
for Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/>Instead of requesting him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) to enter she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) came to the porch. A discourse
was carried on between them in low measured tones for the space of ten
minutes or more. At the end of the time Mrs. Yeobright went in, and Venn
sadly retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) steps into the heath. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had again regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
van he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) lit the lantern, and with an apathetic face at once began to pull
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) best clothes, till in the course of a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) reappeared
as the confirmed and irretrievable reddleman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had seemed before.




<p/>8--Firmness Is Discovered in a Gentle Heart


<p/>On that evening the interior of Blooms-End, though cosy and comfortable,
had been rather silent. Clym Yeobright was not at home. Since the
Christmas party he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had gone on a few days' visit to a friend about ten
miles off.

<p/>The shadowy form seen by Venn to part from Wildeve in the porch, and
quickly withdraw into the house, was Thomasin's. On entering she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) threw
down a cloak which had been carelessly wrapped round her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>), and came
forward to the light, where Mrs. Yeobright sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) work-table,
drawn up within the settle, so that part of it projected into the
chimney-corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like your going out after dark alone, Tamsin,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt
quietly, without looking up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only been just outside the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>inquired Mrs. Yeobright, struck by a change in the tone of
Thomasin's voice, and observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). Thomasin's cheek was flushed to a
pitch far beyond that which it had reached before her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) troubles, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
eyes glittered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was HE (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) who knocked,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought as much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) wishes the marriage to be at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! What--is he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) anxious?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Yeobright directed a searching look
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) niece. <div class="bookquote">``Why did not Mr. Wildeve come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) did not wish to. You are not friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) says. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would
like the wedding to be the day after tomorrow, quite privately; at the
church of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) parish--not at ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! And what did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I agreed to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Thomasin answered firmly. <div class="bookquote">``I am a practical woman
now. I don't believe in hearts at all. I would marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) under any
circumstances since--since Clym's letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>A letter was lying on Mrs. Yeobright's work-basket, and at Thomasin's
words her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt reopened it, and silently read for the tenth time that
day:--



<p/>What is the meaning of this silly story that people are circulating
about Thomasin and Mr. Wildeve? I should call such a scandal humiliating
if there was the least chance of its being true. How could such a gross
falsehood have arisen? It is said that one should go abroad to hear news
of home, and I appear to have done it. Of course I contradict the
tale everywhere; but it is very vexing, and I wonder how it could have
originated. It is too ridiculous that such a girl as Thomasin could so
mortify us as to get jilted on the wedding day. What has she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) done?



<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Yeobright said sadly, putting down the letter. <div class="bookquote">``If you
think you can marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), do so. And since Mr. Wildeve wishes it to be
unceremonious, let it be that too. I can do nothing. It is all in your
own hands now. My power over your welfare came to an end when you
left this house to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) to Anglebury.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) continued, half in
bitterness, <div class="bookquote">``I may almost ask, why do you consult me in the matter at
all? If you had gone and married him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) without saying a word to me, I
could hardly have been angry--simply because, poor girl, you can't do a
better thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that and dishearten me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right--I will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not plead for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), Aunt. Human nature is weak, and I am not a
blind woman to insist that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) is perfect. I did think so, but I don't
now. But I know my course, and you know that I know it. I hope for the
best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I, and we will both continue to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright, rising
and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Then the wedding, if it comes off, will be on the
morning of the very day Clym comes home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I decided that it ought to be over before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) came. After that you
can look him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) in the face, and so can I. Our concealments will matter
nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) head in thoughtful assent, and presently said,
<div class="bookquote">``Do you wish me to give you away? I am willing to undertake that, you
know, if you wish, as I was last time. After once forbidding the banns I
think I can do no less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I will ask you to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin reluctantly, but
with decision. <div class="bookquote">``It would be unpleasant, I am almost sure. Better let
there be only strangers present, and none of my relations at all. I
would rather have it so. I do not wish to do anything which may touch
your credit, and I feel that I should be uncomfortable if you were
there, after what has passed. I am only your niece, and there is no
necessity why you should concern yourself more about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has beaten us,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt said. <div class="bookquote">``It really seems as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had
been playing with you in this way in revenge for my humbling him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as I
did by standing up against him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>murmured Thomasin.

<p/>They said no more on the subject then. Diggory Venn's knock came soon
after; and Mrs. Yeobright, on returning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) interview with him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) in
the porch, carelessly observed, <div class="bookquote">``Another lover has come to ask for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that queer young man Venn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Asks to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) addresses to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin looked silently into the candle-flame. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Diggory!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
said, and then aroused herself to other things.

<p/>The next day was passed in mere mechanical deeds of preparation, both
the women being anxious to immerse themselves in these to escape the
emotional aspect of the situation. Some wearing apparel and other
articles were collected anew for Thomasin, and remarks on domestic
details were frequently made, so as to obscure any inner misgivings
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) future as Wildeve's wife.

<p/>The appointed morning came. The arrangement with Wildeve was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
should meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) at the church to guard against any unpleasant curiosity
which might have affected them had they been seen walking off together
in the usual country way.

<p/>Aunt and niece stood together in the bedroom where the bride was
dressing. The sun, where it could catch it, made a mirror of Thomasin's
hair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) always wore braided. It was braided according to a
calendar system--the more important the day the more numerous the
strands in the braid. On ordinary working-days she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) braided it in threes;
on ordinary Sundays in fours; at Maypolings, gipsyings, and the like,
she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) braided it in fives. Years ago she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had said that when she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) married
she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) would braid it in sevens. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had braided it in sevens today.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking that I will wear my blue silk after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``It is my wedding day, even though there may be something sad
about the time. I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) added, anxious to correct any wrong
impression, <div class="bookquote">``not sad in itself, but in its having had great
disappointment and trouble before it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright breathed in a way which might have been called a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I
almost wish Clym had been at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Of course you chose the
time because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) absence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly. I have felt that I acted unfairly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) in not telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>)
all; but, as it was done not to grieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>), I thought I would carry out
the plan to its end, and tell the whole story when the sky was clear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a practical little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish you and he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>)--no, I don't wish anything. There, it is nine o’clock,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) interrupted, hearing a whizz and a dinging downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told Damon I would leave at nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin, hastening out of
the room.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt followed. When Thomasin was going up the little walk from the
door to the wicket-gate, Mrs. Yeobright looked reluctantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), and
said, <div class="bookquote">``It is a shame to let you go alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>added her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt with forced cheerfulness, <div class="bookquote">``I shall
call upon you this afternoon, and bring the cake with me. If Clym has
returned by that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) will perhaps come too. I wish to show Mr.
Wildeve that I bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) no ill-will. Let the past be forgotten. Well,
God bless you! There, I don't believe in old superstitions, but I'll
do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) threw a slipper at the retreating figure of the girl, who
turned, smiled, and went on again.

<p/>A few steps further, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) looked back. <div class="bookquote">``Did you call me, Aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
tremulously inquired. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Moved by an uncontrollable feeling as she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) looked upon Mrs. Yeobright's
worn, wet face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) ran back, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt came forward, and they met
again. <div class="bookquote">``O--Tamsie,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the elder, weeping, <div class="bookquote">``I don't like to let you
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I am--''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Thomasin began, giving way likewise. But, quelling her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
grief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>again and went on.

<p/>Then Mrs. Yeobright saw a little figure wending its way between the
scratching furze-bushes, and diminishing far up the valley--a pale-blue
spot in a vast field of neutral brown, solitary and undefended except by
the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) own hope.

<p/>But the worst feature in the case was one which did not appear in the
landscape; it was the man.

<p/>The hour chosen for the ceremony by Thomasin and Wildeve had been so
timed as to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) to escape the awkwardness of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) cousin
Clym, who was returning the same morning. To own to the partial truth
of what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had heard would be distressing as long as the humiliating
position resulting from the event was unimproved. It was only after a
second and successful journey to the altar that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
head and prove the failure of the first attempt a pure accident.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had not been gone from Blooms-End more than half an hour when
Yeobright came by the meads from the other direction and entered the
house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had an early breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mother after greeting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Now I could eat a little more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat down to the repeated meal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) went on in a low, anxious
voice, apparently imagining that Thomasin had not yet come downstairs,
<div class="bookquote">``What's this I have heard about Thomasin and Mr. Wildeve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true in many points,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright quietly; <div class="bookquote">``but it is all
right now, I hope.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) looked at the clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomasin is gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym pushed away his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) breakfast. <div class="bookquote">``Then there is a scandal of some sort,
and that's what's the matter with Thomasin. Was it this that made her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Not a scandal--a misfortune. I will tell you all about it, Clym.
You must not be angry, but you must listen, and you'll find that what we
have done has been done for the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) then told him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) the circumstances. All that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had known of the affair
before he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) returned from Paris was that there had existed an
attachment between Thomasin and Wildeve, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mother had at first
discountenanced, but had since, owing to the arguments of Thomasin,
looked upon in a little more favourable light. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), therefore,
proceeded to explain all he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was greatly surprised and troubled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) determined that the wedding should be over before you came
back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright, <div class="bookquote">``that there might be no chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
meeting you, and having a very painful time of it. That's why she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has
gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); they have arranged to be married this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright, rising. ```Tis so unlike
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). I can see why you did not write to me after her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) unfortunate return
home. But why didn't you let me know when the wedding was going to
be--the first time?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I felt vexed with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) just then. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seemed to me to be
obstinate; and when I found that you were nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind I vowed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should be nothing in yours. I felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was only my
niece after all; I told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might marry, but that I should take no
interest in it, and should not bother you about it either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't have been bothering me. Mother, you did wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it might disturb you in your business, and that you might
throw up your situation, or injure your prospects in some way because of
it, so I said nothing. Of course, if they had married at that time in a
proper manner, I should have told you at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tamsin actually being married while we are sitting here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Unless some accident happens again, as it did the first time. It
may, considering he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s the same man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and I believe it will. Was it right to let her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) go? Suppose Wildeve
is really a bad fellow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) won't come, and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'ll come home again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have looked more into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is useless to say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mother answered with an impatient look
of sorrow. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know how bad it has been here with us all these
weeks, Clym. You don't know what a mortification anything of that sort
is to a woman. You don't know the sleepless nights we've had in this
house, and the almost bitter words that have passed between us since
that Fifth of November. I hope never to pass seven such weeks again.
Tamsin has not gone outside the door, and I have been ashamed to look
anybody in the face; and now you blame me for letting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) do the only
thing that can be done to set that trouble straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Upon the whole I don't blame you. But just
consider how sudden it seems to me. Here was I, knowing nothing; and
then I am told all at once that Tamsie is gone to be married. Well,
I suppose there was nothing better to do. Do you know, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
continued after a moment or two, looking suddenly interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) own
past history, <div class="bookquote">``I once thought of Tamsin as a sweetheart? Yes, I did. How
odd boys are! And when I came home and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) seemed so
much more affectionate than usual, that I was quite reminded of those
days, particularly on the night of the party, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was unwell. We
had the party just the same--was not that rather cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It made no difference. I had arranged to give one, and it was not worth
while to make more gloom than necessary. To begin by shutting ourselves
up and telling you of Tamsin's misfortunes would have been a poor sort
of welcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym remained thinking. <div class="bookquote">``I almost wish you had not had that party,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``and for other reasons. But I will tell you in a day or two. We
must think of Tamsin now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They lapsed into silence. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright again,
in a tone which showed some slumbering feeling still. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it
kind to Tamsin to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Tamsin</b></font>) be married like this, and neither of us there
to keep up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tamsin</b></font>) spirits or care a bit about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tamsin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tamsin</b></font>) hasn't disgraced
herself, or done anything to deserve that. It is bad enough that the
wedding should be so hurried and unceremonious, without our keeping away
from it in addition. Upon my soul, `tis almost a shame. I'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is over by this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mother with a sigh; <div class="bookquote">``unless they
were late, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Tamsin</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall be soon enough to see them come out. I don't quite like
your keeping me in ignorance, Mother, after all. Really, I half hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Tamsin</b></font>)
has failed to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) character?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense--that wouldn't ruin Thomasin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hat and hastily left the house. Mrs. Yeobright looked
rather unhappy, and sat still, deep in thought. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was not long
left alone. A few minutes later Clym came back again, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) company
came Diggory Venn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I find there isn't time for me to get there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) married?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Yeobright inquired, turning to the reddleman a
face in which a strange strife of wishes, for and against, was apparent.

<p/>Venn bowed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange it sounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>murmured Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tamsin</b></font>) didn't disappoint her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) this time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tamsin</b></font>) did not. And there is now no slight on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) name. I was hastening
ath'art to tell you at once, as I saw you were not there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How came you to be there? How did you know it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been in that neighbourhood for some time, and I saw them go in,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman. <div class="bookquote">``Wildeve came up to the door, punctual as the clock.
I didn't expect it of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tamsin</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) did not add, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) might have added, that
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) came to be in that neighbourhood was not by accident; that,
since Wildeve's resumption of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) right to Thomasin, Venn, with the
thoroughness which was part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) character, had determined to see the
end of the episode.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody hardly. I stood right out of the way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) did not see me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div>The reddleman spoke huskily, and looked into the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very remarkable! Miss Vye! It is to be considered an honour, I
suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's Miss Vye?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Vye's granddaughter, of Mistover Knap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A proud girl from Budmouth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``One not much to my
liking. People say she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s a witch, but of course that's absurd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The reddleman kept to himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) acquaintance with that fair personage,
and also that Eustacia was there because he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) went to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), in
accordance with a promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had given as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) learnt that the
marriage was to take place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) merely said, in continuation of the
story--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sitting on the churchyard wall when they came up, one from one
way, the other from the other; and Miss Vye was walking thereabouts,
looking at the headstones. As soon as they had gone in I went to the
door, feeling I should like to see it, as I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so well. I pulled
off my boots because they were so noisy, and went up into the gallery. I
saw then that the parson and clerk were already there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How came Miss Vye to have anything to do with it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) was only on a
walk that way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because there was nobody else. She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had gone into the church just before
me, not into the gallery. The parson looked round before beginning, and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) was the only one near he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) beckoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) went up to the
rails. After that, when it came to signing the book, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) pushed up her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)
veil and signed; and Tamsin seemed to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) kindness.''  (<font color='red'><b>The reddleman</b></font>)</div>The
reddleman told the tale thoughtfully for there lingered upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) vision
the changing colour of Wildeve, when Eustacia lifted the thick veil
which had concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) from recognition and looked calmly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
face. <div class="bookquote">``And then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Diggory sadly, <div class="bookquote">``I came away, for her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) history as
Tamsin Yeobright was over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I offered to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright regretfully. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) said it was
not necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is no matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman. <div class="bookquote">``The thing is done at last
as it was meant to be at first, and God send her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) happiness. Now I'll
wish you good morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) head and went out.

<p/>From that instant of leaving Mrs. Yeobright's door, the reddleman was
seen no more in or about Egdon Heath for a space of many months. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>)
vanished entirely. The nook among the brambles where his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) van had been
standing was as vacant as ever the next morning, and scarcely a sign
remained to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) had been there, excepting a few straws, and a
little redness on the turf, which was washed away by the next storm of
rain.

<p/>The report that Diggory had brought of the wedding, correct as far as it
went, was deficient in one significant particular, which had escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>)
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) being at some distance back in the church. When Thomasin
was tremblingly engaged in signing her (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) name Wildeve had flung towards
Eustacia a glance that said plainly, <div class="bookquote">``I have punished you now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) had
replied in a low tone--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) little thought how truly--<div class="bookquote">``You mistake; it
gives me sincerest pleasure to see her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) your wife today.''





 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>BOOK THREE -- THE FASCINATION




<p/>1--<div class="bookquote">``My Mind to Me a Kingdom Is''


 (<font color='red'><b>Clym Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>In Clym Yeobright's face could be dimly seen the typical countenance
of the future. Should there be a classic period to art hereafter, its
Pheidias may produce such faces. The view of life as a thing to be put
up with, replacing that zest for existence which was so intense in early
civilizations, must ultimately enter so thoroughly into the constitution
of the advanced races that its facial expression will become accepted
as a new artistic departure. People already feel that a man who lives
without disturbing a curve of feature, or setting a mark of mental
concern anywhere upon himself, is too far removed from modern
perceptiveness to be a modern type. Physically beautiful men--the glory
of the race when it was young--are almost an anachronism now; and we may
wonder whether, at some time or other, physically beautiful women may
not be an anachronism likewise.

<p/>The truth seems to be that a long line of disillusive centuries has
permanently displaced the Hellenic idea of life, or whatever it may
be called. What the Greeks only suspected we know well; what their
Aeschylus imagined our nursery children feel. That old-fashioned
revelling in the general situation grows less and less possible as we
uncover the defects of natural laws, and see the quandary that man is in
by their operation.

<p/>The lineaments which will get embodied in ideals based upon this new
recognition will probably be akin to those of Yeobright. The observer's
eye was arrested, not by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face as a picture, but by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face as a
page; not by what it was, but by what it recorded. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features were
attractive in the light of symbols, as sounds intrinsically common
become attractive in language, and as shapes intrinsically simple become
interesting in writing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been a lad of whom something was expected. Beyond this all had
been chaos. That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be successful in an original way, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would go to the dogs in an original way, seemed equally probable. The
only absolute certainty about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not stand still in
the circumstances amid which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was born.

<p/>Hence, when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was casually mentioned by neighbouring yeomen,
the listener said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Clym Yeobright--what is he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) doing now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the listener</b></font>)</div>When the
instinctive question about a person is, What is he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) doing? it is
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) will be found to be, like most of us, doing nothing in
particular. There is an indefinite sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) must be invading some
region of singularity, good or bad. The devout hope is that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) is doing
well. The secret faith is that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) is making a mess of it. Half a dozen
comfortable market-men, who were habitual callers at the Quiet Woman
as they passed by in their carts, were partial to the topic. In fact,
though they were not Egdon men, they could hardly avoid it while they
sucked their long clay tubes and regarded the heath through the window.
Clym had been so inwoven with the heath in his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) boyhood that hardly
anybody could look upon it without thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>). So the subject
recurred: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) were making a fortune and a name, so much the better
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>); if he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) were making a tragical figure in the world, so much the
better for a narrative.

<p/>The fact was that Yeobright's fame had spread to an awkward extent
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) left home. <div class="bookquote">``It is bad when your fame outruns your means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jesuit</b></font>)</div>said
the Spanish Jesuit Gracian. At the age of six he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) had asked a Scripture
riddle: <div class="bookquote">``Who was the first man known to wear breeches?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and applause
had resounded from the very verge of the heath. At seven he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) painted the
Battle of Waterloo with tiger-lily pollen and black-currant juice, in
the absence of water-colours. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) reached twelve he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) had in
this manner been heard of as artist and scholar for at least two miles
round. An individual whose fame spreads three or four thousand yards in
the time taken by the fame of others similarly situated to travel six or
eight hundred, must of necessity have something in him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>). Possibly Clym's
fame, like Homer's, owed something to the accidents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) situation;
nevertheless famous he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) was.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) grew up and was helped out in life. That waggery of fate which
started Clive as a writing clerk, Gay as a linen-draper, Keats as a
surgeon, and a thousand others in a thousand other odd ways, banished
the wild and ascetic heath lad to a trade whose sole concern was with
the especial symbols of self-indulgence and vainglory.

<p/>The details of this choice of a business for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) it is not necessary
to give. At the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father a neighbouring gentleman had kindly
undertaken to give the boy a start, and this assumed the form of sending
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to Budmouth. Yeobright did not wish to go there, but it was the only
feasible opening. Thence he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) went to London; and thence, shortly after,
to Paris, where he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had remained till now.

<p/>Something being expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had not been at home many days
before a great curiosity as to why he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) stayed on so long began to arise
in the heath. The natural term of a holiday had passed, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) still
remained. On the Sunday morning following the week of Thomasin's
marriage a discussion on this subject was in progress at a hair-cutting
before Fairway's house. Here the local barbering was always done at
this hour on this day, to be followed by the great Sunday wash of the
inhabitants at noon, which in its turn was followed by the great Sunday
dressing an hour later. On Egdon Heath Sunday proper did not begin till
dinner-time, and even then it was a somewhat battered specimen of the
day.

<p/>These Sunday-morning hair-cuttings were performed by Fairway; the victim
sitting on a chopping-block in front of the house, without a coat, and
the neighbours gossiping around, idly observing the locks of hair as
they rose upon the wind after the snip, and flew away out of sight to
the four quarters of the heavens. Summer and winter the scene was the
same, unless the wind were more than usually blusterous, when the stool
was shifted a few feet round the corner. To complain of cold in sitting
out of doors, hatless and coatless, while Fairway told true stories
between the cuts of the scissors, would have been to pronounce yourself
no man at once. To flinch, exclaim, or move a muscle of the face at
the small stabs under the ear received from those instruments, or at
scarifications of the neck by the comb, would have been thought a gross
breach of good manners, considering that Fairway did it all for nothing.
A bleeding about the poll on Sunday afternoons was amply accounted for
by the explanation. <div class="bookquote">``I have had my hair cut, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation on Yeobright had been started by a distant view of the
young man rambling leisurely across the heath before them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man who is doing well elsewhere wouldn't bide here two or three weeks
for nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got some project in `s head--depend
upon that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `a can't keep a diment shop here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have had them two heavy boxes home if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
not been going to bide; and what there is for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do here the Lord in
heaven knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Before many more surmises could be indulged in Yeobright had come near;
and seeing the hair-cutting group he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) turned aside to join them. Marching
up, and looking critically at their faces for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said, without
introduction, <div class="bookquote">``Now, folks, let me guess what you have been talking
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sure, if you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, it is a thing I shouldn't have dreamed of doing, otherwise,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Fairway in a tone of integrity; <div class="bookquote">``but since you have named it, Master
Yeobright, I'll own that we was talking about `ee. We were wondering
what could keep you home here mollyhorning about when you have made such
a world-wide name for yourself in the nick-nack trade--now, that's the
truth o't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright with unexpected earnestness. <div class="bookquote">``I am
not sorry to have the opportunity. I've come home because, all things
considered, I can be a trifle less useless here than anywhere else. But
I have only lately found this out. When I first got away from home I
thought this place was not worth troubling about. I thought our life
here was contemptible. To oil your boots instead of blacking them, to
dust your coat with a switch instead of a brush--was there ever anything
more ridiculous? I said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So `tis; so `tis!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no--you are wrong; it isn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beg your pardon, we thought that was your meaning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as my views changed my course became very depressing. I found
that I was trying to be like people who had hardly anything in common
with myself. I was endeavouring to put off one sort of life for another
sort of life, which was not better than the life I had known before. It
was simply different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True; a sight different,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Paris must be a taking place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey. <div class="bookquote">``Grand shop-winders,
trumpets, and drums; and here be we out of doors in all winds and
weathers--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you mistake me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pleaded Clym. <div class="bookquote">``All this was very depressing. But
not so depressing as something I next perceived--that my business was
the idlest, vainest, most effeminate business that ever a man could
be put to. That decided me--I would give it up and try to follow some
rational occupation among the people I knew best, and to whom I could
be of most use. I have come home; and this is how I mean to carry out
my plan. I shall keep a school as near to Egdon as possible, so as to be
able to walk over here and have a night-school in my mother's house.
But I must study a little at first, to get properly qualified. Now,
neighbours, I must go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And Clym resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) walk across the heath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>)'ll never carry it out in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``In a few weeks
he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>)'ll learn to see things otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis good-hearted of the young man,'' said another. <div class="bookquote">``But, for my part, I
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) had better mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) business.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Disappointment Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>2--The New Course Causes Disappointment


<p/>Yeobright loved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kind. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a conviction that the want of most men
was knowledge of a sort which brings wisdom rather than affluence. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wished to raise the class at the expense of individuals rather than
individuals at the expense of the class. What was more, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ready at
once to be the first unit sacrificed.

<p/>In passing from the bucolic to the intellectual life the intermediate
stages are usually two at least, frequently many more; and one of those
stages is almost sure to be worldly advanced. We can hardly imagine
bucolic placidity quickening to intellectual aims without imagining
social aims as the transitional phase. Yeobright's local peculiarity was
that in striving at high thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still cleaved to plain living--nay,
wild and meagre living in many respects, and brotherliness with clowns.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a John the Baptist who took ennoblement rather than repentance
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) text. Mentally he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in a provincial future, that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in
many points abreast with the central town thinkers of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) date. Much of
this development he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have owed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) studious life in Paris, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become acquainted with ethical systems popular at the time.

<p/>In consequence of this relatively advanced position, Yeobright might
have been called unfortunate. The rural world was not ripe for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). A
man should be only partially before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time--to be completely to the
vanward in aspirations is fatal to fame. Had Philip's warlike son been
intellectually so far ahead as to have attempted civilization without
bloodshed, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have been twice the godlike hero that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) seemed, but
nobody would have heard of an Alexander.

<p/>In the interests of renown the forwardness should lie chiefly in the
capacity to handle things. Successful propagandists have succeeded
because the doctrine they bring into form is that which their listeners
have for some time felt without being able to shape. A man who advocates
aesthetic effort and deprecates social effort is only likely to be
understood by a class to which social effort has become a stale matter.
To argue upon the possibility of culture before luxury to the bucolic
world may be to argue truly, but it is an attempt to disturb a sequence
to which humanity has been long accustomed. Yeobright preaching to
the Egdon eremites that they might rise to a serene comprehensiveness
without going through the process of enriching themselves was not unlike
arguing to ancient Chaldeans that in ascending from earth to the pure
empyrean it was not necessary to pass first into the intervening heaven
of ether.

<p/>Was Yeobright's mind well-proportioned? No. A well proportioned mind is
one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that
it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a
heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer. Also, on the other hand, that it
will never cause him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to be applauded as a prophet, revered as a priest,
or exalted as a king. Its usual blessings are happiness and mediocrity.
It produces the poetry of Rogers, the paintings of West, the statecraft
of North, the spiritual guidance of Tomline; enabling its possessors to
find their way to wealth, to wind up well, to step with dignity off the
stage, to die comfortably in their beds, and to get the decent monument
which, in many cases, they deserve. It never would have allowed
Yeobright to do such a ridiculous thing as throw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) business to
benefit his (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) fellow-creatures.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) walked along towards home without attending to paths. If anyone knew
the heath well it was Clym. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) was permeated with its scenes, with its
substance, and with its odours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) might be said to be its product. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>)
eyes had first opened thereon; with its appearance all the first images
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) memory were mingled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) estimate of life had been coloured by
it: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) toys had been the flint knives and arrow-heads which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) found
there, wondering why stones should <div class="bookquote">``grow''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to such odd shapes; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>)
flowers, the purple bells and yellow furze: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) animal kingdom, the
snakes and croppers; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) society, its human haunters. Take all the
varying hates felt by Eustacia Vye towards the heath, and translate
them into loves, and you have the heart of Clym. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) gazed upon the wide
prospect as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) walked, and was glad.

<p/>To many persons this Egdon was a place which had slipped out of its
century generations ago, to intrude as an uncouth object into this.
It was an obsolete thing, and few cared to study it. How could this
be otherwise in the days of square fields, plashed hedges, and meadows
watered on a plan so rectangular that on a fine day they looked like
silver gridirons? The farmer, in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) ride, who could smile at artificial
grasses, look with solicitude at the coming corn, and sigh with sadness
at the fly-eaten turnips, bestowed upon the distant upland of heath
nothing better than a frown. But as for Yeobright, when he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) looked
from the heights on his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) way he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could not help indulging in a barbarous
satisfaction at observing that, in some of the attempts at reclamation
from the waste, tillage, after holding on for a year or two, had receded
again in despair, the ferns and furze-tufts stubbornly reasserting
themselves.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) descended into the valley, and soon reached his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) home at Blooms-End.
His (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) mother was snipping dead leaves from the window-plants. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked
up at him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not understand the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) long stay with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face had worn that look for several days. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could perceive
that the curiosity which had been shown by the hair-cutting group
amounted in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) mother to concern. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had asked no question with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips, even when the arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) trunk suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was not
going to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soon. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) silence besought an explanation of him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) more
loudly than words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going back to Paris again, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``At least, in my
old capacity. I have given up the business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright turned in pained surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I thought something was
amiss, because of the boxes. I wonder you did not tell me sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to have done it. But I have been in doubt whether you would be
pleased with my plan. I was not quite clear on a few points myself. I am
going to take an entirely new course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am astonished, Clym. How can you want to do better than you've been
doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very easily. But I shall not do better in the way you mean; I suppose
it will be called doing worse. But I hate that business of mine, and I
want to do some worthy thing before I die. As a schoolmaster I think
to do it--a school-master to the poor and ignorant, to teach them what
nobody else will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After all the trouble that has been taken to give you a start, and when
there is nothing to do but to keep straight on towards affluence, you
say you will be a poor man's schoolmaster. Your fancies will be your
ruin, Clym.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright spoke calmly, but the force of feeling behind the words
was but too apparent to one who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son did. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did
not answer. There was in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face that hopelessness of being understood
which comes when the objector is constitutionally beyond the reach of
a logic that, even under favouring conditions, is almost too coarse a
vehicle for the subtlety of the argument.

<p/>No more was said on the subject till the end of dinner. His (<font color='blue'><b>objector</b></font>) mother then
began, as if there had been no interval since the morning. <div class="bookquote">``It disturbs
me, Clym, to find that you have come home with such thoughts as those. I
hadn't the least idea that you meant to go backward in the world by your
own free choice. Of course, I have always supposed you were going to
push straight on, as other men do--all who deserve the name--when they
have been put in a good way of doing well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym, in a troubled tone. <div class="bookquote">``Mother, I hate
the flashy business. Talk about men who deserve the name, can any man
deserving the name waste his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time in that effeminate way, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees
half the world going to ruin for want of somebody to buckle to and teach
them how to breast the misery they are born to? I get up every morning
and see the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain, as St. Paul
says, and yet there am I, trafficking in glittering splendours with
wealthy women and titled libertines, and pandering to the meanest
vanities--I, who have health and strength enough for anything. I have
been troubled in my mind about it all the year, and the end is that I
cannot do it any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't you do it as well as others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, except that there are many things other people care for
which I don't; and that's partly why I think I ought to do this. For one
thing, my body does not require much of me. I cannot enjoy delicacies;
good things are wasted upon me. Well, I ought to turn that defect to
advantage, and by being able to do without what other people require I
can spend what such things cost upon anybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, Yeobright, having inherited some of these very instincts from the
woman before him (<font color='blue'><b>objector</b></font>), could not fail to awaken a reciprocity in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) through
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings, if not by arguments, disguise it as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might for his (<font color='blue'><b>objector</b></font>)
good. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke with less assurance. <div class="bookquote">``And yet you might have been a
wealthy man if you had only persevered. Manager to that large diamond
establishment--what better can a man wish for? What a post of trust
and respect! I suppose you will be like your father; like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), you are
getting weary of doing well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``I am not weary of that, though I am weary of what
you mean by it. Mother, what is doing well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright was far too thoughtful a woman to be content with ready
definitions, and, like the <div class="bookquote">``What is wisdom?''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>of Plato's Socrates, and
the <div class="bookquote">``What is truth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Plato Socrates</b></font>)</div>of Pontius Pilate, Yeobright's burning question
received no answer.

<p/>The silence was broken by the clash of the garden gate, a tap at the
door, and its opening. Christian Cantle appeared in the room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>)
Sunday clothes.

<p/>It was the custom on Egdon to begin the preface to a story before
absolutely entering the house, so as to be well in for the body of the
narrative by the time visitor and visited stood face to face. Christian
had been saying to them while the door was leaving its latch, <div class="bookquote">``To think
that I, who go from home but once in a while, and hardly then, should
have been there this morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis news you have brought us, then, Christian?'' said Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sure, about a witch, and ye must overlook my time o' day; for, says
I, `I must go and tell `em, though they won't have half done dinner.' I
assure ye it made me shake like a driven leaf. Do ye think any harm will
come o't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This morning at church we was all standing up, and the pa'son said,
`Let us pray.' `Well,' thinks I, `one may as well kneel as stand'; so
down I went; and, more than that, all the rest were as willing to oblige
the man as I. We hadn't been hard at it for more than a minute when a
most terrible screech sounded through church, as if somebody had just
gied up their heart's blood. All the folk jumped up and then we found
that Susan Nunsuch had pricked Miss Vye with a long stocking-needle, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) had threatened to do as soon as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) could get the young lady to
church, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) don't come very often. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>)'ve waited for this chance
for weeks, so as to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) blood and put an end to the bewitching of
Susan's children that has been carried on so long. Sue followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) into
church, sat next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could find a chance in went
the stocking-needle into my lady's arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heaven, how horrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) that deep that the maid fainted away; and as I was
afeard there might be some tumult among us, I got behind the bass viol
and didn't see no more. But they carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) out into the air, `tis
said; but when they looked round for Sue she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was gone. What a scream
that girl gied, poor thing! There were the pa'son in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) surplice
holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hand and saying, `Sit down, my good people, sit down!'
But the deuce a bit would they sit down. O, and what d’ye think I
found out, Mrs. Yeobright? The pa'son wears a suit of clothes under his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
surplice!--I could see his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) black sleeves when he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis a cruel thing,'' said Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The nation ought to look into it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian. <div class="bookquote">``Here's Humphrey
coming, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div><p/>In came Humphrey. <div class="bookquote">``Well, have ye heard the news? But I see you have.
`Tis a very strange thing that whenever one of Egdon folk goes to church
some rum job or other is sure to be doing. The last time one of us was
there was when neighbour Fairway went in the fall; and that was the day
you forbad the banns, Mrs. Yeobright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has this cruelly treated girl been able to walk home?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) got better, and went home very well. And now I've told it
I must be moving homeward myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said Humphrey. <div class="bookquote">``Truly now we shall see if there's anything in
what folks say about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>When they were gone into the heath again Yeobright said quietly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)
mother, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I have turned teacher too soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is right that there should be schoolmasters, and missionaries, and
all such men,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``But it is right, too, that I should try to
lift you out of this life into something richer, and that you should not
come back again, and be as if I had not tried at all.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><p/>Later in the day Sam, the turf-cutter, entered. <div class="bookquote">``I've come a-borrowing,
Mrs. Yeobright. I suppose you have heard what's been happening to the
beauty on the hill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sam: half a dozen have been telling us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beauty?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, tolerably well-favoured,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>Sam replied. <div class="bookquote">``Lord! all the country owns
that `tis one of the strangest things in the world that such a woman
should have come to live up there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dark or fair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, though I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) twenty times, that's a thing I cannot call to
mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Darker than Tamsin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A woman who seems to care for nothing at all, as you may say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is melancholy, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mopes about by herself, and don't mix in with the people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a young lady inclined for adventures?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to my knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't join in with the lads in their games, to get some sort of
excitement in this lonely place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mumming, for instance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) notions be different. I should rather say her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts were far
away from here, with lords and ladies she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll never know, and mansions
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll never see again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Observing that Clym appeared singularly interested Mrs. Yeobright said
rather uneasily to Sam, <div class="bookquote">``You see more in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) than most of us do. Miss
Vye is to my mind too idle to be charming. I have never heard that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is of any use to herself or to other people. Good girls don't get
treated as witches even on Egdon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense--that proves nothing either way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of course I don't understand such niceties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam,
withdrawing from a possibly unpleasant argument; <div class="bookquote">``and what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is we
must wait for time to tell us. The business that I have really called
about is this, to borrow the longest and strongest rope you have. The
captain's bucket has dropped into the well, and they are in want of
water; and as all the chaps are at home today we think we can get it out
for him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). We have three cart-ropes already, but they won't reach to the
bottom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) might have whatever ropes he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) could find
in the outhouse, and Sam went out to search. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) passed by the door
Clym joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), and accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to the gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this young witch-lady going to stay long at Mistover?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a cruel shame to ill-use her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), She (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) must have suffered greatly--more
in mind than in body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twas a graceless trick--such a handsome girl, too. You ought to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Mr. Yeobright, being a young man come from far, and with a little
more to show for your years than most of us.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would like to teach children?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym.

<p/>Sam shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Quite a different sort of body from that, I
reckon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, it was merely something which occurred to me. It would of course be
necessary to see her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) and talk it over--not an easy thing, by the way,
for my family and hers are not very friendly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you how you mid see her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), Mr. Yeobright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam. <div class="bookquote">``We are
going to grapple for the bucket at six o’clock tonight at her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) house, and
you could lend a hand. There's five or six coming, but the well is deep,
and another might be useful, if you don't mind appearing in that shape.
She (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s sure to be walking round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright; and they parted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) thought of it a good deal; but nothing more was said about Eustacia
inside the house at that time. Whether this romantic martyr to
superstition and the melancholy mummer he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) had conversed with under the
full moon were one and the same person remained as yet a problem.




<p/>3--The First Act in a Timeworn Drama


<p/>The afternoon was fine, and Yeobright walked on the heath for an hour
with his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) mother. When they reached the lofty ridge which divided the
valley of Blooms-End from the adjoining valley they stood still and
looked round. The Quiet Woman Inn was visible on the low margin of the
heath in one direction, and afar on the other hand rose Mistover Knap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to call on Thomasin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But you need not come this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case I'll branch off here, Mother. I am going to Mistover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) inquiringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to help them get the bucket out of the captain's well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>)
continued. <div class="bookquote">``As it is so very deep I may be useful. And I should like
to see this Miss Vye--not so much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) good looks as for another
reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) mother asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And they parted. <div class="bookquote">``There is no help for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clym mother</b></font>)</div>murmured Clym's mother
gloomily as he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) withdrew. <div class="bookquote">``They are sure to see each other. I wish Sam
would carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) news to other houses than mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym's retreating figure got smaller and smaller as it rose and
fell over the hillocks on his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) way. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) is tender-hearted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Yeobright to herself while she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``otherwise it would matter
little. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'s going on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) was, indeed, walking with a will over the furze, as straight as a
line, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) life depended upon it. His (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) mother drew a long breath,
and, abandoning the visit to Thomasin, turned back. The evening films
began to make nebulous pictures of the valleys, but the high lands still
were raked by the declining rays of the winter sun, which glanced on
Clym as he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) walked forward, eyed by every rabbit and field-fare around, a
long shadow advancing in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>).

<p/>On drawing near to the furze-covered bank and ditch which fortified
the captain's dwelling he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) could hear voices within, signifying that
operations had been already begun. At the side-entrance gate he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) stopped
and looked over.

<p/>Half a dozen able-bodied men were standing in a line from the
well-mouth, holding a rope which passed over the well-roller into the
depths below. Fairway, with a piece of smaller rope round his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) body, made
fast to one of the standards, to guard against accidents, was leaning
over the opening, his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) right hand clasping the vertical rope that
descended into the well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, silence, folks,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/>The talking ceased, and Fairway gave a circular motion to the rope,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) were stirring batter. At the end of a minute a dull splashing
reverberated from the bottom of the well; the helical twist he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had
imparted to the rope had reached the grapnel below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haul!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway; and the men who held the rope began to gather it
over the wheel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we've got sommat,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one of the haulers-in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then pull steady,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/>They gathered up more and more, till a regular dripping into the well
could be heard below. It grew smarter with the increasing height of the
bucket, and presently a hundred and fifty feet of rope had been pulled
in.

<p/>Fairway then lit a lantern, tied it to another cord, and began lowering
it into the well beside the first: Clym came forward and looked down.
Strange humid leaves, which knew nothing of the seasons of the year,
and quaint-natured mosses were revealed on the wellside as the lantern
descended; till its rays fell upon a confused mass of rope and bucket
dangling in the dank, dark air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've only got en by the edge of the hoop--steady, for God's sake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/>They pulled with the greatest gentleness, till the wet bucket appeared
about two yards below them, like a dead friend come to earth again.
Three or four hands were stretched out, then jerk went the rope, whizz
went the wheel, the two foremost haulers fell backward, the beating of
a falling body was heard, receding down the sides of the well, and a
thunderous uproar arose at the bottom. The bucket was gone again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn the bucket!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lower again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm as stiff as a ram's horn stooping so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway, standing
up and stretching himself till his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) joints creaked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rest a few minutes, Timothy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``I'll take your place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The grapnel was again lowered. Its smart impact upon the distant water
reached their ears like a kiss, whereupon Yeobright knelt down, and
leaning over the well began dragging the grapnel round and round as
Fairway had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tie a rope round him (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>)--it is dangerous!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a soft and anxious voice
somewhere above them.

<p/>Everybody turned. The speaker was a woman, gazing down upon the group
from an upper window, whose panes blazed in the ruddy glare from the
west. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips were parted and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appeared for the moment to forget
where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was.

<p/>The rope was accordingly tied round his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) waist, and the work proceeded.
At the next haul the weight was not heavy, and it was discovered that
they had only secured a coil of the rope detached from the bucket. The
tangled mass was thrown into the background. Humphrey took Yeobright's
place, and the grapnel was lowered again.

<p/>Yeobright retired to the heap of recovered rope in a meditative mood. Of
the identity between the lady's voice and that of the melancholy
mummer he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had not a moment's doubt. <div class="bookquote">``How thoughtful of her (<font color='blue'><b>folks</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said to
himself.

<p/>Eustacia, who had reddened when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) perceived the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
exclamation upon the group below, was no longer to be seen at the
window, though Yeobright scanned it wistfully. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) stood there the
men at the well succeeded in getting up the bucket without a mishap. One
of them went to inquire for the captain, to learn what orders he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wished
to give for mending the well-tackle. The captain proved to be away from
home, and Eustacia appeared at the door and came out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had lapsed
into an easy and dignified calm, far removed from the intensity of life
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) words of solicitude for Clym's safety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be possible to draw water here tonight?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss; the bottom of the bucket is clean knocked out. And as we can
do no more now we'll leave off, and come again tomorrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No water,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) murmured, turning away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can send you up some from Blooms-End,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>said Clym, coming forward and
raising his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hat as the men retired.

<p/>Yeobright and Eustacia looked at each other for one instant, as if each
had in mind those few moments during which a certain moonlight scene was
common to both. With the glance the calm fixity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) features sublimed
itself to an expression of refinement and warmth; it was like garish
noon rising to the dignity of sunset in a couple of seconds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; it will hardly be necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you have no water?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is what I call no water,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, blushing, and lifting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) long-lashed eyelids as if to lift them were a work requiring
consideration. <div class="bookquote">``But my grandfather calls it water enough. I'll show you
what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) moved away a few yards, and Clym followed. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) reached the
corner of the enclosure, where the steps were formed for mounting the
boundary bank, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sprang up with a lightness which seemed strange after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) listless movement towards the well. It incidentally showed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
apparent languor did not arise from lack of force.

<p/>Clym ascended behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and noticed a circular burnt patch at the top
of the bank. <div class="bookquote">``Ashes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia. <div class="bookquote">``We had a little bonfire here last Fifth of
November, and those are the marks of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On that spot had stood the fire she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had kindled to attract Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the only kind of water we have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) continued, tossing a stone
into the pool, which lay on the outside of the bank like the white of
an eye without its pupil. The stone fell with a flounce, but no Wildeve
appeared on the other side, as on a previous occasion there. <div class="bookquote">``My
grandfather says he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) lived for more than twenty years at sea on water
twice as bad as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``and considers it quite good enough
for us here on an emergency.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as a matter of fact there are no impurities in the water of these
pools at this time of the year. It has only just rained into them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I am managing to exist in a wilderness, but I
cannot drink from a pond,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said.

<p/>Clym looked towards the well, which was now deserted, the men having
gone home. <div class="bookquote">``It is a long way to send for spring-water,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) said, after a
silence. <div class="bookquote">``But since you don't like this in the pond, I'll try to get you
some myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) went back to the well. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think I could do it by
tying on this pail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, since I would not trouble the men to get it, I cannot in
conscience let you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind the trouble at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) made fast the pail to the long coil of rope, put it over the wheel,
and allowed it to descend by letting the rope slip through his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) hands.
Before it had gone far, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) checked it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must make fast the end first, or we may lose the whole,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) said to
Eustacia, who had drawn near. <div class="bookquote">``Could you hold this a moment, while I do
it--or shall I call your servant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hold it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia; and he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) placed the rope in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hands,
going then to search for the end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I may let it slip down?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would advise you not to let it go far,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``It will get much
heavier, you will find.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>However, Eustacia had begun to pay out. While he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) was tying she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I
cannot stop it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) side, and found he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) could only check the rope by twisting
the loose part round the upright post, when it stopped with a jerk. <div class="bookquote">``Has
it hurt you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I think not.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hands. One of them was bleeding; the
rope had dragged off the skin. Eustacia wrapped it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have let go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said I was to hold on... This is the second time I have been
wounded today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; I have heard of it. I blush for my native Egdon. Was it a
serious injury you received in church, Miss Vye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>There was such an abundance of sympathy in Clym's tone that Eustacia
slowly drew up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sleeve and disclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) round white arm. A bright
red spot appeared on its smooth surface, like a ruby on Parian marble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) finger against the spot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was dastardly of the woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``Will not Captain Vye get
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) punished?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is gone from home on that very business. I did not know that I had
such a magic reputation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you fainted?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Clym, looking at the scarlet little puncture as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) would like to kiss it and make it well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it frightened me. I had not been to church for a long time. And
now I shall not go again for ever so long--perhaps never. I cannot face
their eyes after this. Don't you think it dreadfully humiliating? I
wished I was dead for hours after, but I don't mind now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come to clean away these cobwebs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``Would you
like to help me--by high-class teaching? We might benefit them much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite feel anxious to. I have not much love for my
fellow-creatures. Sometimes I quite hate them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still I think that if you were to hear my scheme you might take an
interest in it. There is no use in hating people--if you hate anything,
you should hate what produced them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean Nature? I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) already. But I shall be glad to hear
your scheme at any time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The situation had now worked itself out, and the next natural thing was
for them to part. Clym knew this well enough, and Eustacia made a move
of conclusion; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had one word more to say.
Perhaps if he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had not lived in Paris it would never have been uttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have met before,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) said, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) with rather more interest
than was necessary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not own it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia, with a repressed, still look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I may think what I like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are lonely here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot endure the heath, except in its purple season. The heath is a
cruel taskmaster to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``To my mind it is most exhilarating, and
strengthening, and soothing. I would rather live on these hills than
anywhere else in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well enough for artists; but I never would learn to draw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there is a very curious druidical stone just out there.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) threw a
pebble in the direction signified. <div class="bookquote">``Do you often go to see it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not even aware there existed any such curious druidical stone. I
am aware that there are boulevards in Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright looked thoughtfully on the ground. <div class="bookquote">``That means much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember when I had the same longing for town bustle. Five years of a
great city would be a perfect cure for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven send me such a cure! Now, Mr. Yeobright, I will go indoors and
plaster my wounded hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>They separated, and Eustacia vanished in the increasing shade. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
seemed full of many things. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) past was a blank, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) life had begun.
The effect upon Clym of this meeting he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) did not fully discover till some
time after. During his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) walk home his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) most intelligible sensation was
that his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) scheme had somehow become glorified. A beautiful woman had been
intertwined with it.

<p/>On reaching the house he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) went up to the room which was to be made his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>)
study, and occupied himself during the evening in unpacking his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) books
from the boxes and arranging them on shelves. From another box he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) drew
a lamp and a can of oil. He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) trimmed the lamp, arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) table, and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, I am ready to begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) rose early the next morning, read two hours before breakfast by the
light of his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) lamp--read all the morning, all the afternoon. Just when
the sun was going down his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) eyes felt weary, and he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) leant back in his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>)
chair.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) room overlooked the front of the premises and the valley of the
heath beyond. The lowest beams of the winter sun threw the shadow of the
house over the palings, across the grass margin of the heath, and far
up the vale, where the chimney outlines and those of the surrounding
tree-tops stretched forth in long dark prongs. Having been seated at
work all day, he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) decided to take a turn upon the hills before it got
dark; and, going out forthwith, he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) struck across the heath towards
Mistover.

<p/>It was an hour and a half later when he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) again appeared at the garden
gate. The shutters of the house were closed, and Christian Cantle, who
had been wheeling manure about the garden all day, had gone home. On
entering he (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) mother, after waiting a long time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>),
had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) meal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you been, Clym?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) immediately said. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell
me that you were going away at this time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been on the heath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll meet Eustacia Vye if you go up there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym paused a minute. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I met her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) said, as though
it were spoken under the sheer necessity of preserving honesty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wondered if you had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was no appointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; such meetings never are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not angry, Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly say that I am not. Angry? No. But when I consider the
usual nature of the drag which causes men of promise to disappoint the
world I feel uneasy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You deserve credit for the feeling, Mother. But I can assure you that
you need not be disturbed by it on my account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I think of you and your new crotchets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright,
with some emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``I naturally don't feel so comfortable as I did a
twelvemonth ago. It is incredible to me that a man accustomed to the
attractive women of Paris and elsewhere should be so easily worked upon
by a girl in a heath. You could just as well have walked another way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had been studying all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) added more hopefully, <div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking that you
might get on as a schoolmaster, and rise that way, since you really are
determined to hate the course you were pursuing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright was unwilling to disturb this idea, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) scheme was far
enough removed from one wherein the education of youth should be made
a mere channel of social ascent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) had no desires of that sort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) had
reached the stage in a young man's life when the grimness of the general
human situation first becomes clear; and the realization of this causes
ambition to halt awhile. In France it is not uncustomary to commit
suicide at this stage; in England we do much better, or much worse, as
the case may be.

<p/>The love between the young man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother was strangely invisible
now. Of love it may be said, the less earthly the less demonstrative. In
its absolutely indestructible form it reaches a profundity in which all
exhibition of itself is painful. It was so with these. Had conversations
between them been overheard, people would have said, <div class="bookquote">``How cold they are
to each other!''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) theory and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wishes about devoting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future to teaching had made
an impression on Mrs. Yeobright. Indeed, how could it be otherwise
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)--when their discourses were as if carried on
between the right and the left hands of the same body? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had despaired
of reaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) by argument; and it was almost as a discovery to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) by a magnetism which was as superior to words as
words are to yells.

<p/>Strangely enough he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to feel now that it would not be so hard
to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) who was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best friend that comparative poverty was
essentially the higher course for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as to reconcile to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings
the act of persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). From every provident point of view his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother
was so undoubtedly right, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not without a sickness of heart in
finding he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could shake her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a singular insight into life, considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had never
mixed with it. There are instances of persons who, without clear ideas
of the things they criticize have yet had clear ideas of the relations
of those things. Blacklock, a poet blind from his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) birth, could describe
visual objects with accuracy; Professor Sanderson, who was also blind,
gave excellent lectures on colour, and taught others the theory of ideas
which they had and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sanderson</b></font>) had not. In the social sphere these gifted ones
are mostly women; they can watch a world which they never saw, and
estimate forces of which they have only heard. We call it intuition.

<p/>What was the great world to Mrs. Yeobright? A multitude whose tendencies
could be perceived, though not its essences. Communities were seen by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) as from a distance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) saw them as we see the throngs which cover
the canvases of Sallaert, Van Alsloot, and others of that school--vast
masses of beings, jostling, zigzagging, and processioning in definite
directions, but whose features are indistinguishable by the very
comprehensiveness of the view.

<p/>One could see that, as far as it had gone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) life was very complete on
its reflective side. The philosophy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) nature, and its limitation by
circumstances, was almost written in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) movements. They had a majestic
foundation, though they were far from being majestic; and they had a
ground-work of assurance, but they were not assured. As her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) once elastic
walk had become deadened by time, so had her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) natural pride of life been
hindered in its blooming by her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) necessities.

<p/>The next slight touch in the shaping of Clym's destiny occurred a few
days after. A barrow was opened on the heath, and Yeobright attended the
operation, remaining away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) study during several hours. In the
afternoon Christian returned from a journey in the same direction, and
Mrs. Yeobright questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have dug a hole, and they have found things like flowerpots upside
down, Mis'ess Yeobright; and inside these be real charnel bones. They
have carried `em off to men's houses; but I shouldn't like to sleep
where they will bide. Dead folks have been known to come and claim their
own. Mr. Yeobright had got one pot of the bones, and was going to bring
`em home--real skellington bones--but `twas ordered otherwise. You'll be
relieved to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) gave away his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) pot and all, on second thoughts;
and a blessed thing for ye, Mis'ess Yeobright, considering the wind o'
nights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gave it away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. To Miss Vye. She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) has a cannibal taste for such churchyard
furniture seemingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vye was there too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, `a b'lieve she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>When Clym came home, which was shortly after, his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mother said, in a
curious tone, <div class="bookquote">``The urn you had meant for me you gave away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright made no reply; the current of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feeling was too pronounced
to admit it.

<p/>The early weeks of the year passed on. Yeobright certainly studied at
home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) also walked much abroad, and the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) walk was
always towards some point of a line between Mistover and Rainbarrow.

<p/>The month of March arrived, and the heath showed its first signs of
awakening from winter trance. The awakening was almost feline in its
stealthiness. The pool outside the bank by Eustacia's dwelling, which
seemed as dead and desolate as ever to an observer who moved and made
noises in his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) observation, would gradually disclose a state of great
animation when silently watched awhile. A timid animal world had come to
life for the season. Little tadpoles and efts began to bubble up through
the water, and to race along beneath it; toads made noises like very
young ducks, and advanced to the margin in twos and threes; overhead,
bumblebees flew hither and thither in the thickening light, their drone
coming and going like the sound of a gong.

<p/>On an evening such as this Yeobright descended into the Blooms-End
valley from beside that very pool, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had been standing with
another person quite silently and quite long enough to hear all this
puny stir of resurrection in nature; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had not heard it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) walk
was rapid as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) came down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) went with a springy trend. Before
entering upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mother's premises he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) stopped and breathed. The light
which shone forth on him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) from the window revealed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face was
flushed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eye bright. What it did not show was something which
lingered upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) lips like a seal set there. The abiding presence of
this impress was so real that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) hardly dared to enter the house, for it
seemed as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mother might say, <div class="bookquote">``What red spot is that glowing upon
your mouth so vividly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) entered soon after. The tea was ready, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) sat down opposite
his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not speak many words; and as for him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), something
had been just done and some words had been just said on the hill which
prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) from beginning a desultory chat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mother's taciturnity
was not without ominousness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) appeared not to care. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) knew why
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said so little, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could not remove the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bearing
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). These half-silent sittings were far from uncommon with them
now. At last Yeobright made a beginning of what was intended to strike
at the whole root of the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Five days have we sat like this at meals with scarcely a word. What's
the use of it, Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), in a heart-swollen tone. <div class="bookquote">``But there is only too good a
reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not when you know all. I have been wanting to speak about this, and I
am glad the subject is begun. The reason, of course, is Eustacia Vye.
Well, I confess I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) lately, and have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) a good many
times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; and I know what that amounts to. It troubles me, Clym. You
are wasting your life here; and it is solely on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). If
it had not been for that woman you would never have entertained this
teaching scheme at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym looked hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``You know that is not it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I know you had decided to attempt it before you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>); but
that would have ended in intentions. It was very well to talk of, but
ridiculous to put in practice. I fully expected that in the course of a
month or two you would have seen the folly of such self-sacrifice, and
would have been by this time back again to Paris in some business or
other. I can understand objections to the diamond trade--I really was
thinking that it might be inadequate to the life of a man like you even
though it might have made you a millionaire. But now I see how mistaken
you are about this girl I doubt if you could be correct about other
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I mistaken in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is lazy and dissatisfied. But that is not all of it. Supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
to be as good a woman as any you can find, which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) certainly is not,
why do you wish to connect yourself with anybody at present?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there are practical reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Clym began, and then almost broke
off under an overpowering sense of the weight of argument which could
be brought against his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) statement. <div class="bookquote">``If I take a school an educated woman
would be invaluable as a help to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you really mean to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be premature to state that plainly. But consider what obvious
advantages there would be in doing it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has any money. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hasn't a farthing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is excellently educated, and would make a good matron in a
boarding-school. I candidly own that I have modified my views a little,
in deference to you; and it should satisfy you. I no longer adhere to
my intention of giving with my own mouth rudimentary education to the
lowest class. I can do better. I can establish a good private school
for farmers' sons, and without stopping the school I can manage to
pass examinations. By this means, and by the assistance of a wife like
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Clym!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall ultimately, I hope, be at the head of one of the best schools
in the county.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright had enunciated the word <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>with a fervour which, in
conversation with a mother, was absurdly indiscreet. Hardly a maternal
heart within the four seas could in such circumstances, have helped
being irritated at that ill-timed betrayal of feeling for a new woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are blinded, Clym,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said warmly. <div class="bookquote">``It was a bad day for you when
you first set eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). And your scheme is merely a castle in the
air built on purpose to justify this folly which has seized you, and to
salve your conscience on the irrational situation you are in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, that's not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) firmly answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you maintain that I sit and tell untruths, when all I wish to do
is to save you from sorrow? For shame, Clym! But it is all through that
woman--a hussy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym reddened like fire and rose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mother's
shoulder and said, in a tone which hung strangely between entreaty and
command, <div class="bookquote">``I won't hear it. I may be led to answer you in a way which we
shall both regret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mother parted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips to begin some other vehement truth, but on
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face which led her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to leave the
words unsaid. Yeobright walked once or twice across the room, and then
suddenly went out of the house. It was eleven o’clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) came in,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had not been further than the precincts of the garden. His (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
mother was gone to bed. A light was left burning on the table, and
supper was spread. Without stopping for any food he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) secured the doors
and went upstairs.




<p/>4--An Hour of Bliss and Many Hours of Sadness


<p/>The next day was gloomy enough at Blooms-End. Yeobright remained in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) study, sitting over the open books; but the work of those hours was
miserably scant. Determined that there should be nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) conduct
towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) mother resembling sullenness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) had occasionally spoken to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on passing matters, and would take no notice of the brevity of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
replies. With the same resolve to keep up a show of conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>)
said, about seven o’clock in the evening, <div class="bookquote">``There's an eclipse of the
moon tonight. I am going out to see it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) overcoat,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>The low moon was not as yet visible from the front of the house, and
Yeobright climbed out of the valley until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) stood in the full flood
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) light. But even now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) walked on, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) steps were in the
direction of Rainbarrow.

<p/>In half an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) stood at the top. The sky was clear from verge to
verge, and the moon flung her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rays over the whole heath, but without
sensibly lighting it, except where paths and water-courses had laid bare
the white flints and glistening quartz sand, which made streaks upon the
general shade. After standing awhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) stooped and felt the heather. It
was dry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) flung himself down upon the barrow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) face towards the
moon, which depicted a small image of herself in each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) had often come up here without stating his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) purpose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) mother;
but this was the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) had been ostensibly frank as to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) purpose while really concealing it. It was a moral situation which,
three months earlier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) could hardly have credited of himself. In
returning to labour in this sequestered spot he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) had anticipated an
escape from the chafing of social necessities; yet behold they were
here also. More than ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) longed to be in some world where personal
ambition was not the only recognized form of progress--such, perhaps, as
might have been the case at some time or other in the silvery globe then
shining upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) eye travelled over the length and breadth of that
distant country--over the Bay of Rainbows, the sombre Sea of Crises,
the Ocean of Storms, the Lake of Dreams, the vast Walled Plains, and
the wondrous Ring Mountains--till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) almost felt himself to be voyaging
bodily through its wild scenes, standing on its hollow hills, traversing
its deserts, descending its vales and old sea bottoms, or mounting to
the edges of its craters.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) watched the far-removed landscape a tawny stain grew into being
on the lower verge--the eclipse had begun. This marked a preconcerted
moment--for the remote celestial phenomenon had been pressed into
sublunary service as a lover's signal. Yeobright's mind flew back to
earth at the sight; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arose, shook himself and listened. Minute after
minute passed by, perhaps ten minutes passed, and the shadow on the moon
perceptibly widened. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) heard a rustling on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) left hand, a cloaked
figure with an upturned face appeared at the base of the Barrow, and
Clym descended. In a moment the figure was in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arms, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lips
upon hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Eustacia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clym, dearest!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Such a situation had less than three months brought forth.

<p/>They remained long without a single utterance, for no language could
reach the level of their condition--words were as the rusty implements
of a by-gone barbarous epoch, and only to be occasionally tolerated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I began to wonder why you did not come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had
withdrawn a little from his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) embrace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said ten minutes after the first mark of shade on the edge of the
moon, and that's what it is now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let us only think that here we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, holding each other's hand, they were again silent, and the shadow
on the moon's disc grew a little larger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it seemed long since you last saw me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has seemed sad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not long? That's because you occupy yourself, and so blind yourself
to my absence. To me, who can do nothing, it has been like living under
stagnant water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather bear tediousness, dear, than have time made short by
such means as have shortened mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way is that? You have been thinking you wished you did not love
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can a man wish that, and yet love on? No, Eustacia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Men can, women cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, whatever I may have thought, one thing is certain--I do love
you--past all compass and description. I love you to oppressiveness--I,
who have never before felt more than a pleasant passing fancy for any
woman I have ever seen. Let me look right into your moonlit face and
dwell on every line and curve in it! Only a few hairbreadths make the
difference between this face and faces I have seen many times before I
knew you; yet what a difference--the difference between everything and
nothing at all. One touch on that mouth again! there, and there, and
there. Your eyes seem heavy, Eustacia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is my general way of looking. I think it arises from my feeling
sometimes an agonizing pity for myself that I ever was born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't feel it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Yet I know that we shall not love like this always. Nothing can
ensure the continuance of love. It will evaporate like a spirit, and so
I feel full of fears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you don't know. You have seen more than I, and have been into
cities and among people that I have only heard of, and have lived more
years than I; but yet I am older at this than you. I loved another man
once, and now I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In God's mercy don't talk so, Eustacia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do not think I shall be the one who wearies first. It will, I
fear, end in this way: your mother will find out that you meet me, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will influence you against me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That can never be. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knows of these meetings already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) speaks against me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, go away! Obey her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I shall ruin you. It is foolish of you
to meet me like this. Kiss me, and go away forever. Forever--do you
hear?--forever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your only chance. Many a man's love has been a curse to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are desperate, full of fancies, and wilful; and you misunderstand.
I have an additional reason for seeing you tonight besides love of you.
For though, unlike you, I feel our affection may be eternal. I feel with
you in this, that our present mode of existence cannot last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! `tis your mother. Yes, that's it! I knew it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what it is. Believe this, I cannot let myself lose you. I
must have you always with me. This very evening I do not like to let
you go. There is only one cure for this anxiety, dearest--you must be my
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) started--then endeavoured to say calmly, <div class="bookquote">``Cynics say that cures the
anxiety by curing the love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must answer me. Shall I claim you some day--I don't mean at
once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>Eustacia murmured. <div class="bookquote">``At present speak of Paris to me. Is
there any place like it on earth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very beautiful. But will you be mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be nobody else's in the world--does that satisfy you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, for the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now tell me of the Tuileries, and the Louvre,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) continued evasively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate talking of Paris! Well, I remember one sunny room in the
Louvre which would make a fitting place for you to live in--the Galerie
d’Apollon. Its windows are mainly east; and in the early morning,
when the sun is bright, the whole apartment is in a perfect blaze of
splendour. The rays bristle and dart from the encrustations of gilding
to the magnificent inlaid coffers, from the coffers to the gold and
silver plate, from the plate to the jewels and precious stones, from
these to the enamels, till there is a perfect network of light which
quite dazzles the eye. But now, about our marriage--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Versailles--the King's Gallery is some such gorgeous room, is it
not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But what's the use of talking of gorgeous rooms? By the way, the
Little Trianon would suit us beautifully to live in, and you might
walk in the gardens in the moonlight and think you were in some English
shrubbery; It is laid out in English fashion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hate to think that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you could keep to the lawn in front of the Grand Palace. All about
there you would doubtless feel in a world of historical romance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) went on, since it was all new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and described Fontainebleau,
St. Cloud, the Bois, and many other familiar haunts of the Parisians;
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When used you to go to these places?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On Sundays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes. I dislike English Sundays. How I should chime in with their
manners over there! Dear Clym, you'll go back again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym shook his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) head, and looked at the eclipse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll go back again I'll--be something,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said tenderly, putting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head near his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) breast. <div class="bookquote">``If you'll agree I'll give my promise, without
making you wait a minute longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How extraordinary that you and my mother should be of one mind about
this!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``I have vowed not to go back, Eustacia. It is not
the place I dislike; it is the occupation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can go in some other capacity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Besides, it would interfere with my scheme. Don't press that,
Eustacia. Will you marry me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now--never mind Paris; it is no better than other spots. Promise,
sweet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will never adhere to your education plan, I am quite sure; and then
it will be all right for me; and so I promise to be yours for ever and
ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face towards his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) by a gentle pressure of the hand, and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but you don't know what you have got in me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I
think there is not that in Eustacia Vye which will make a good
homespun wife. Well, let it go--see how our time is slipping, slipping,
slipping!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) pointed towards the half-eclipsed moon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too mournful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Only I dread to think of anything beyond the present. What is, we
know. We are together now, and it is unknown how long we shall be so;
the unknown always fills my mind with terrible possibilities, even
when I may reasonably expect it to be cheerful... Clym, the eclipsed
moonlight shines upon your face with a strange foreign colour, and shows
its shape as if it were cut out in gold. That means that you should be
doing better things than this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are ambitious, Eustacia--no, not exactly ambitious, luxurious. I
ought to be of the same vein, to make you happy, I suppose. And yet, far
from that, I could live and die in a hermitage here, with proper work to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lover</b></font>)</div><p/>There was that in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) tone which implied distrust of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) position as
a solicitous lover, a doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were acting fairly towards one whose
tastes touched his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own only at rare and infrequent points. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
meaning, and whispered, in a low, full accent of eager assurance <div class="bookquote">``Don't
mistake me, Clym--though I should like Paris, I love you for yourself
alone. To be your wife and live in Paris would be heaven to me; but I
would rather live with you in a hermitage here than not be yours at all.
It is gain to me either way, and very great gain. There's my too candid
confession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Spoken like a woman. And now I must soon leave you. I'll walk with you
towards your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But must you go home yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, the sand has nearly slipped
away, I see, and the eclipse is creeping on more and more. Don't go yet!
Stop till the hour has run itself out; then I will not press you any
more. You will go home and sleep well; I keep sighing in my sleep! Do
you ever dream of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot recollect a clear dream of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see your face in every scene of my dreams, and hear your voice in
every sound. I wish I did not. It is too much what I feel. They say
such love never lasts. But it must! And yet once, I remember, I saw an
officer of the Hussars ride down the street at Budmouth, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
was a total stranger and never spoke to me, I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) till I thought
I should really die of love--but I didn't die, and at last I left off
caring for him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). How terrible it would be if a time should come when I
could not love you, my Clym!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't say such reckless things. When we see such a time at hand
we will say, `I have outlived my faith and purpose,' and die. There, the
hour has expired--now let us walk on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Hand in hand they went along the path towards Mistover. When they were
near the house he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It is too late for me to see your grandfather
tonight. Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) will object to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>). I am so accustomed to be my own mistress that it
did not occur to me that we should have to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they lingeringly separated, and Clym descended towards Blooms-End.

<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) walked further and further from the charmed atmosphere of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
Olympian girl his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) face grew sad with a new sort of sadness. A perception
of the dilemma in which his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) love had placed him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) came back in full force.
In spite of Eustacia's apparent willingness to wait through the period
of an unpromising engagement, till he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should be established in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) new
pursuit, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could not but perceive at moments that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) rather
as a visitant from a gay world to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) rightly belonged than as
a man with a purpose opposed to that recent past of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) which so
interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). It meant that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) made no conditions as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
return to the French capital, this was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) secretly longed for in
the event of marriage; and it robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of many an otherwise pleasant
hour. Along with that came the widening breach between himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mother. Whenever any little occurrence had brought into more prominence
than usual the disappointment that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was causing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) it had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on
lone and moody walks; or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was kept awake a great part of the night
by the turmoil of spirit which such a recognition created. If Mrs.
Yeobright could only have been led to see what a sound and worthy
purpose this purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was and how little it was being affected by
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) devotions to Eustacia, how differently would she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) regard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!

<p/>Thus as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight grew accustomed to the first blinding halo kindled
about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by love and beauty, Yeobright began to perceive what a
strait he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never known Eustacia,
immediately to retract the wish as brutal. Three antagonistic growths
had to be kept alive: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plan for becoming a
teacher, and Eustacia's happiness. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fervid nature could not afford
to relinquish one of these, though two of the three were as many as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hope to preserve. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love was as chaste as that of
Petrarch for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Laura, it had made fetters of what previously was
only a difficulty. A position which was not too simple when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood
whole-hearted had become indescribably complicated by the addition of
Eustacia. Just when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother was beginning to tolerate one scheme
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had introduced another still bitterer than the first, and the
combination was more than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could bear.




<p/>5--Sharp Words Are Spoken, and a Crisis Ensues


<p/>When Yeobright was not with Eustacia he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sitting slavishly over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
books; when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not reading he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). These meetings were
carried on with the greatest secrecy.

<p/>One afternoon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother came home from a morning visit to Thomasin. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could see from a disturbance in the lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face that something had
happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been told an incomprehensible thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``The
captain has let out at the Woman that you and Eustacia Vye are engaged
to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``But it may not be yet for a very long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hardly think it WOULD be yet for a very long time! You will
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) to Paris, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke with weary hopelessness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going back to Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you do with a wife, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep a school in Budmouth, as I have told you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's incredible! The place is overrun with schoolmasters. You have no
special qualifications. What possible chance is there for such as you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no chance of getting rich. But with my system of education,
which is as new as it is true, I shall do a great deal of good to my
fellow-creatures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dreams, dreams! If there had been any system left to be invented they
would have found it out at the universities long before this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, Mother. They cannot find it out, because their teachers don't
come in contact with the class which demands such a system--that
is, those who have had no preliminary training. My plan is one for
instilling high knowledge into empty minds without first cramming them
with what has to be uncrammed again before true study begins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might have believed you if you had kept yourself free from
entanglements; but this woman--if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been a good girl it would have
been bad enough; but being--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a good girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you think. A Corfu bandmaster's daughter! What has her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) life been?
Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) surname even is not her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) true one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is Captain Vye's granddaughter, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father merely took her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
mother's name. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is a lady by instinct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They call him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) `captain,' but anybody is captain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was in the Royal Navy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) has been to sea in some tub or other. Why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) look
after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)? No lady would rove about the heath at all hours of the day
and night as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does. But that's not all of it. There was something
queer between her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and Thomasin's husband at one time--I am as sure of it
as that I stand here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eustacia has told me. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did pay her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a little attention a year ago; but
there's no harm in that. I like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) all the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clym,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother with firmness, <div class="bookquote">``I have no proofs against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
unfortunately. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) makes you a good wife, there has never been a
bad one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe me, you are almost exasperating,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright vehemently.
<div class="bookquote">``And this very day I had intended to arrange a meeting between you. But
you give me no peace; you try to thwart my wishes in everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate the thought of any son of mine marrying badly! I wish I had
never lived to see this; it is too much for me--it is more than I
dreamt!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned to the window. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breath was coming quickly, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips were pale, parted, and trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym, <div class="bookquote">``whatever you do, you will always be dear to
me--that you know. But one thing I have a right to say, which is, that
at my age I am old enough to know what is best for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright remained for some time silent and shaken, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could
say no more. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Best? Is it best for you to injure your
prospects for such a voluptuous, idle woman as that? Don't you see that
by the very fact of your choosing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) you prove that you do not know
what is best for you? You give up your whole thought--you set your whole
soul--to please a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. And that woman is you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you treat me so flippantly!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, turning again to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a tearful look. <div class="bookquote">``You are unnatural, Clym, and I did not expect
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheerlessly. <div class="bookquote">``You did not know the measure you
were going to mete me, and therefore did not know the measure that would
be returned to you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You answer me; you think only of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). You stick to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in all things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That proves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be worthy. I have never yet supported what is bad.
And I do not care only for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I care for you and for myself, and
for anything that is good. When a woman once dislikes another she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is
merciless!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Clym! please don't go setting down as my fault what is your obstinate
wrongheadedness. If you wished to connect yourself with an unworthy
person why did you come home here to do it? Why didn't you do it in
Paris?--it is more the fashion there. You have come only to distress me,
a lonely woman, and shorten my days! I wish that you would bestow your
presence where you bestow your love!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym said huskily, <div class="bookquote">``You are my mother. I will say no more--beyond this,
that I beg your pardon for having thought this my home. I will no longer
inflict myself upon you; I'll go.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went out with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/>It was a sunny afternoon at the beginning of summer, and the moist
hollows of the heath had passed from their brown to their green stage.
Yeobright walked to the edge of the basin which extended down from
Mistover and Rainbarrow.

<p/>By this time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was calm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked over the landscape. In the minor
valleys, between the hillocks which diversified the contour of the vale,
the fresh young ferns were luxuriantly growing up, ultimately to reach
a height of five or six feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) descended a little way, flung himself
down in a spot where a path emerged from one of the small hollows, and
waited. Hither it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had promised Eustacia to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother
this afternoon, that they might meet and be friends. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attempt had
utterly failed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in a nest of vivid green. The ferny vegetation round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though
so abundant, was quite uniform--it was a grove of machine-made foliage,
a world of green triangles with saw-edges, and not a single flower. The
air was warm with a vaporous warmth, and the stillness was unbroken.
Lizards, grasshoppers, and ants were the only living things to
be beheld. The scene seemed to belong to the ancient world of the
carboniferous period, when the forms of plants were few, and of the fern
kind; when there was neither bud nor blossom, nothing but a monotonous
extent of leafage, amid which no bird sang.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>) had reclined for some considerable time, gloomily pondering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>)
discerned above the ferns a drawn bonnet of white silk approaching from
the left, and Yeobright knew directly that it covered the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>) loved. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>) heart awoke from its apathy to a warm excitement, and,
jumping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>) said aloud, <div class="bookquote">``I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sure to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) vanished in a hollow for a few moments, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) whole form
unfolded itself from the brake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) exclaimed, with a disappointed air, whose
hollowness was proved by her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) rising redness and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) half-guilty low
laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Where is Mrs. Yeobright?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) has not come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>) replied in a subdued tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had known that you would be here alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said seriously,
<div class="bookquote">``and that we were going to have such an idle, pleasant time as this.
Pleasure not known beforehand is half wasted; to anticipate it is to
double it. I have not thought once today of having you all to myself
this afternoon, and the actual moment of a thing is so soon gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Clym!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) continued, looking tenderly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``You are
sad. Something has happened at your home. Never mind what is--let us
only look at what seems.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, darling, what shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still go on as we do now--just live on from meeting to meeting, never
minding about another day. You, I know, are always thinking of that--I
can see you are. But you must not--will you, dear Clym?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are just like all women. They are ever content to build their lives
on any incidental position that offers itself; whilst men would fain
make a globe to suit them. Listen to this, Eustacia. There is a subject
I have determined to put off no longer. Your sentiment on the wisdom
of Carpe diem does not impress me today. Our present mode of life must
shortly be brought to an end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is. I love you none the less in telling you; it is only right you
should know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have feared my bliss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, with the merest motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lips.
<div class="bookquote">``It has been too intense and consuming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is hope yet. There are forty years of work in me yet, and why
should you despair? I am only at an awkward turning. I wish people
wouldn't be so ready to think that there is no progress without
uniformity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--your mind runs off to the philosophical side of it. Well, these sad
and hopeless obstacles are welcome in one sense, for they enable us to
look with indifference upon the cruel satires that Fate loves to indulge
in. I have heard of people, who, upon coming suddenly into happiness,
have died from anxiety lest they should not live to enjoy it. I felt
myself in that whimsical state of uneasiness lately; but I shall be
spared it now. Let us walk on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym took the hand which was already bared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lizards</b></font>)--it was a favourite
way with them to walk bare hand in bare hand--and led her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) through the
ferns. They formed a very comely picture of love at full flush, as they
walked along the valley that late afternoon, the sun sloping down on
their right, and throwing their thin spectral shadows, tall as poplar
trees, far out across the furze and fern. Eustacia went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head
thrown back fancifully, a certain glad and voluptuous air of triumph
pervading her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes at having won by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own unaided self a man who was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) perfect complement in attainment, appearance, and age. On the young
man's part, the paleness of face which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
from Paris, and the incipient marks of time and thought, were less
perceptible than when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned, the healthful and energetic
sturdiness which was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by nature having partially recovered its
original proportions. They wandered onward till they reached the nether
margin of the heath, where it became marshy and merged in moorland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must part from you here, Clym,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/>They stood still and prepared to bid each other farewell. Everything
before them was on a perfect level. The sun, resting on the horizon
line, streamed across the ground from between copper-coloured and lilac
clouds, stretched out in flats beneath a sky of pale soft green. All
dark objects on the earth that lay towards the sun were overspread by
a purple haze, against which groups of wailing gnats shone out, rising
upwards and dancing about like sparks of fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O! this leaving you is too hard to bear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Eustacia in a
sudden whisper of anguish. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother will influence you too much;
I shall not be judged fairly, it will get afloat that I am not a good
girl, and the witch story will be added to make me blacker!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They cannot. Nobody dares to speak disrespectfully of you or of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh how I wish I was sure of never losing you--that you could not be
able to desert me anyhow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym stood silent a moment. His (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) feelings were high, the moment was
passionate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) cut the knot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall be sure of me, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) said, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) arms.
<div class="bookquote">``We will be married at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Clym!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you agree to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If--if we can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We certainly can, both being of full age. And I have not followed my
occupation all these years without having accumulated money; and if you
will agree to live in a tiny cottage somewhere on the heath, until I
take a house in Budmouth for the school, we can do it at a very little
expense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long shall we have to live in the tiny cottage, Clym?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About six months. At the end of that time I shall have finished my
reading--yes, we will do it, and this heart-aching will be over. We
shall, of course, live in absolute seclusion, and our married life will
only begin to outward view when we take the house in Budmouth, where I
have already addressed a letter on the matter. Would your grandfather
allow you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would--on the understanding that it should not last longer
than six months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will guarantee that, if no misfortune happens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If no misfortune happens,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) repeated slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is not likely. Dearest, fix the exact day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And then they consulted on the question, and the day was chosen. It was
to be a fortnight from that time.

<p/>This was the end of their talk, and Eustacia left him (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>). Clym watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) retired towards the sun. The luminous rays wrapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) up with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) increasing distance, and the rustle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) dress over the sprouting
sedge and grass died away. As he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) watched, the dead flat of the scenery
overpowered him (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) was fully alive to the beauty of that
untarnished early summer green which was worn for the nonce by the
poorest blade. There was something in its oppressive horizontality which
too much reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) of the arena of life; it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) a sense of bare
equality with, and no superiority to, a single living thing under the
sun.

<p/>Eustacia was now no longer the goddess but the woman to him (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>), a being
to fight for, support, help, be maligned for. Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) had reached
a cooler moment he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) would have preferred a less hasty marriage; but the
card was laid, and he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) determined to abide by the game. Whether Eustacia
was to add one other to the list of those who love too hotly to love
long and well, the forthcoming event was certainly a ready way of
proving.




<p/>6--Yeobright Goes, and the Breach Is Complete


<p/>All that evening smart sounds denoting an active packing up came from
Yeobright's room to the ears of his (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) mother downstairs.

<p/>Next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) departed from the house and again proceeded across the
heath. A long day's march was before him (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) object being to secure a
dwelling to which he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) might take Eustacia when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) became his (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) wife.
Such a house, small, secluded, and with its windows boarded up, he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) had
casually observed a month earlier, about two miles beyond the village
of East Egdon, and six miles distant altogether; and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) directed
his (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) steps today.

<p/>The weather was far different from that of the evening before. The
yellow and vapoury sunset which had wrapped up Eustacia from his (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) parting
gaze had presaged change. It was one of those not infrequent days of
an English June which are as wet and boisterous as November. The cold
clouds hastened on in a body, as if painted on a moving slide. Vapours
from other continents arrived upon the wind, which curled and parted
round him (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) walked on.

<p/>At length Clym reached the margin of a fir and beech plantation that had
been enclosed from heath land in the year of his (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) birth. Here the trees,
laden heavily with their new and humid leaves, were now suffering more
damage than during the highest winds of winter, when the boughs are
especially disencumbered to do battle with the storm. The wet young
beeches were undergoing amputations, bruises, cripplings, and harsh
lacerations, from which the wasting sap would bleed for many a day to
come, and which would leave scars visible till the day of their burning.
Each stem was wrenched at the root, where it moved like a bone in its
socket, and at every onset of the gale convulsive sounds came from the
branches, as if pain were felt. In a neighbouring brake a finch was
trying to sing; but the wind blew under his (<font color='blue'><b>finch</b></font>) feathers till they stood on
end, twisted round his (<font color='blue'><b>finch</b></font>) little tail, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>finch</b></font>) give up his (<font color='blue'><b>finch</b></font>) song.

<p/>Yet a few yards to Yeobright's left, on the open heath, how
ineffectively gnashed the storm! Those gusts which tore the trees merely
waved the furze and heather in a light caress. Egdon was made for such
times as these.

<p/>Yeobright reached the empty house about midday. It was almost as lonely
as that of Eustacia's grandfather, but the fact that it stood near
a heath was disguised by a belt of firs which almost enclosed the
premises. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) journeyed on about a mile further to the village in which
the owner lived, and, returning with him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to the house, arrangements were
completed, and the man undertook that one room at least should be ready
for occupation the next day. Clym's intention was to live there alone
until Eustacia should join him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on their wedding-day.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way homeward through the drizzle that had
so greatly transformed the scene. The ferns, among which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lain in
comfort yesterday, were dripping moisture from every frond, wetting
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs through as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brushed past; and the fur of the rabbits leaping
before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was clotted into dark locks by the same watery surrounding.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached home damp and weary enough after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ten-mile walk. It had
hardly been a propitious beginning, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had chosen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) course, and
would show no swerving. The evening and the following morning were spent
in concluding arrangements for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) departure. To stay at home a minute
longer than necessary after having once come to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) determination would
be, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt, only to give new pain to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother by some word, look, or
deed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hired a conveyance and sent off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goods by two o’clock that
day. The next step was to get some furniture, which, after serving
for temporary use in the cottage, would be available for the house
at Budmouth when increased by goods of a better description. A mart
extensive enough for the purpose existed at Anglebury, some miles beyond
the spot chosen for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) residence, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolved to pass the
coming night.

<p/>It now only remained to wish his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother good-bye. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sitting by the
window as usual when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, I am going to leave you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were, by your packing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Yeobright in a voice
from which every particle of emotion was painfully excluded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will part friends with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Clym.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to be married on the twenty-fifth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were going to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then--and then you must come and see us. You will understand me
better after that, and our situation will not be so wretched as it is
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think it likely I shall come to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it will not be my fault or Eustacia's, Mother. Good-bye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) cheek, and departed in great misery, which was several
hours in lessening itself to a controllable level. The position had
been such that nothing more could be said without, in the first place,
breaking down a barrier; and that was not to be done.

<p/>No sooner had Yeobright gone from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's house than her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face
changed its rigid aspect for one of blank despair. After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
wept, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tears brought some relief. During the rest of the day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
did nothing but walk up and down the garden path in a state bordering
on stupefaction. Night came, and with it but little rest. The next day,
with an instinct to do something which should reduce prostration
to mournfulness, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's room, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own hands
arranged it in order, for an imaginary time when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should return
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave some attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flowers, but it was perfunctorily
bestowed, for they no longer charmed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>It was a great relief when, early in the afternoon, Thomasin paid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) an
unexpected visit. This was not the first meeting between the relatives
since Thomasin's marriage; and past blunders having been in a rough way
rectified, they could always greet each other with pleasure and ease.

<p/>The oblique band of sunlight which followed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) through the door became
the young wife well. It illuminated her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) presence illuminated the
heath. In her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) movements, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gaze, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reminded the beholder of
the feathered creatures who lived around her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) home. All similes and
allegories concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began and ended with birds. There was as much
variety in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) motions as in their flight. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was musing she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
a kestrel, which hangs in the air by an invisible motion of its wings.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was in a high wind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) light body was blown against trees and
banks like a heron's. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was frightened she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) darted noiselessly
like a kingfisher. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was serene she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) skimmed like a swallow, and
that is how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was moving now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are looking very blithe, upon my word, Tamsie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Yeobright, with a sad smile. <div class="bookquote">``How is Damon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) is very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) kind to you, Thomasin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Yeobright observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) narrowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty fairly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that honestly said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Aunt. I would tell you if he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) were unkind.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) added, blushing,
and with hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>)--I don't know if I ought to complain to you
about this, but I am not quite sure what to do. I want some money, you
know, Aunt--some to buy little things for myself--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) doesn't give
me any. I don't like to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>); and yet, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) doesn't give it me
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) doesn't know. Ought I to mention it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>), Aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you ought. Have you never said a word on the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, I had some of my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin evasively, <div class="bookquote">``and I have
not wanted any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) until lately. I did just say something about it
last week; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) seems--not to remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) must be made to remember. You are aware that I have a little box
full of spade-guineas, which your uncle put into my hands to divide
between yourself and Clym whenever I chose. Perhaps the time has come
when it should be done. They can be turned into sovereigns at any
moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I should like to have my share--that is, if you don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall, if necessary. But it is only proper that you should first
tell your husband distinctly that you are without any, and see what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, I will... Aunt, I have heard about Clym. I know you are in
trouble about him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and that's why I have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright turned away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) features worked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) attempt to
conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) feelings. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) ceased to make any attempt, and said,
weeping, <div class="bookquote">``O Thomasin, do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hates me? How can he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bear to
grieve me so, when I have lived only for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) through all these years?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hate you--no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``It is only that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
too well. Look at it quietly--do. It is not so very bad of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Do you
know, I thought it not the worst match he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could have made. Miss Vye's
family is a good one on her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) mother's side; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) father was a romantic
wanderer--a sort of Greek Ulysses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no use, Thomasin; it is no use. Your intention is good; but I
will not trouble you to argue. I have gone through the whole that can be
said on either side times, and many times. Clym and I have not parted
in anger; we have parted in a worse way. It is not a passionate quarrel
that would have broken my heart; it is the steady opposition and
persistence in going wrong that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has shown. O Thomasin, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so good
as a little boy--so tender and kind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not think one whom I called mine would grow up to treat me like
this. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke to me as if I opposed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to injure him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). As though I
could wish him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ill!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are worse women in the world than Eustacia Vye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are too many better that's the agony of it. It was she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), Thomasin,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) only, who led your husband to act as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did--I would swear it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``It was before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew me that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought
of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and it was nothing but a mere flirtation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; we will let it be so. There is little use in unravelling
that now. Sons must be blind if they will. Why is it that a woman can
see from a distance what a man cannot see close? Clym must do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
will--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is nothing more to me. And this is maternity--to give one's
best years and best love to ensure the fate of being despised!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too unyielding. Think how many mothers there are whose sons
have brought them to public shame by real crimes before you feel so
deeply a case like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomasin, don't lecture me--I can't have it. It is the excess above
what we expect that makes the force of the blow, and that may not
be greater in their case than in mine--they may have foreseen the
worst... I am wrongly made, Thomasin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) added, with a mournful smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Some widows can guard against the wounds their children give them by
turning their hearts to another husband and beginning life again. But I
always was a poor, weak, one-idea'd creature--I had not the compass of
heart nor the enterprise for that. Just as forlorn and stupefied as
I was when my husband's spirit flew away I have sat ever since--never
attempting to mend matters at all. I was comparatively a young woman
then, and I might have had another family by this time, and have been
comforted by them for the failure of this one son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is more noble in you that you did not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The more noble, the less wise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forget it, and be soothed, dear Aunt. And I shall not leave you alone
for long. I shall come and see you every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>And for one week Thomasin literally fulfilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) endeavoured
to make light of the wedding; and brought news of the preparations, and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was invited to be present. The next week she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was rather unwell,
and did not appear. Nothing had as yet been done about the guineas, for
Thomasin feared to address her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) husband again on the subject, and Mrs.
Yeobright had insisted upon this.


<p/>One day just before this time Wildeve was standing at the door of
the Quiet Woman. In addition to the upward path through the heath
to Rainbarrow and Mistover, there was a road which branched from the
highway a short distance below the inn, and ascended to Mistover by a
circuitous and easy incline. This was the only route on that side for
vehicles to the captain's retreat. A light cart from the nearest town
descended the road, and the lad who was driving pulled up in front of
the inn for something to drink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You come from Mistover?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. They are taking in good things up there. Going to be a wedding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>And the driver buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) mug.

<p/>Wildeve had not received an inkling of the fact before, and a sudden
expression of pain overspread his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) turned for a moment into the
passage to hide it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) came back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean Miss Vye?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``How is it--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) can be married so
soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the will of God and a ready young man, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean Mr. Yeobright?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) has been creeping about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) all the spring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose--she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was immensely taken with him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) is crazy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), so their general servant of all work tells me.
And that lad Charley that looks after the horse is all in a daze about
it. The stun-poll has got fond-like of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) lively--is she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) glad? Going to be married so soon--well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't so very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not so very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve went indoors to the empty room, a curious heartache within him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) elbow upon the mantelpiece and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hand.
When Thomasin entered the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) did not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had heard.
The old longing for Eustacia had reappeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) soul--and it was
mainly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had discovered that it was another man's intention to
possess her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>To be yearning for the difficult, to be weary of that offered; to care
for the remote, to dislike the near; it was Wildeve's nature always.
This is the true mark of the man of sentiment. Though Wildeve's fevered
feeling had not been elaborated to real poetical compass, it was of the
standard sort. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) might have been called the Rousseau of Egdon.




<p/>7--The Morning and the Evening of a Day


<p/>The wedding morning came. Nobody would have imagined from appearances
that Blooms-End had any interest in Mistover that day. A solemn
stillness prevailed around the house of Clym's mother, and there was no
more animation indoors. Mrs. Yeobright, who had declined to attend the
ceremony, sat by the breakfast table in the old room which communicated
immediately with the porch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes listlessly directed towards the
open door. It was the room in which, six months earlier, the merry
Christmas party had met, to which Eustacia came secretly and as a
stranger. The only living thing that entered now was a sparrow; and
seeing no movements to cause alarm, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hopped boldly round the
room, endeavoured to go out by the window, and fluttered among the
pot-flowers. This roused the lonely sitter, who got up, released the
bird, and went to the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>sitter</b></font>) was expecting Thomasin, who had written
the night before to state that the time had come when she (<font color='blue'><b>sitter</b></font>) would wish to
have the money and that she (<font color='blue'><b>sitter</b></font>) would if possible call this day.

<p/>Yet Thomasin occupied Mrs. Yeobright's thoughts but slightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
looked up the valley of the heath, alive with butterflies, and with
grasshoppers whose husky noises on every side formed a whispered chorus.
A domestic drama, for which the preparations were now being made a mile
or two off, was but little less vividly present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes than if
enacted before her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) tried to dismiss the vision, and walked about
the garden plot; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes ever and anon sought out the direction
of the parish church to which Mistover belonged, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) excited fancy
clove the hills which divided the building from her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes. The morning
wore away. Eleven o’clock struck--could it be that the wedding was
then in progress? It must be so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) went on imagining the scene at
the church, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had by this time approached with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) bride. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
pictured the little group of children by the gate as the pony carriage
drove up in which, as Thomasin had learnt, they were going to perform
the short journey. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) saw them enter and proceed to the chancel
and kneel; and the service seemed to go on.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) covered her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``O, it is a mistake!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) groaned.
<div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) will rue it some day, and think of me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) remained thus, overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) forebodings, the old clock
indoors whizzed forth twelve strokes. Soon after, faint sounds floated
to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) ear from afar over the hills. The breeze came from that quarter,
and it had brought with it the notes of distant bells, gaily starting
off in a peal: one, two, three, four, five. The ringers at East Egdon
were announcing the nuptials of Eustacia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is over,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) murmured. ``Well, well! and life too will be over
soon. And why should I go on scalding my face like this? Cry about one
thing in life, cry about all; one thread runs through the whole piece.
And yet we say, `a time to laugh!'''

<p/>Towards evening Wildeve came. Since Thomasin's marriage Mrs. Yeobright
had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) that grim friendliness which at last arises in all such
cases of undesired affinity. The vision of what ought to have been
is thrown aside in sheer weariness, and browbeaten human endeavour
listlessly makes the best of the fact that is. Wildeve, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
justice, had behaved very courteously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife's aunt; and it was
with no surprise that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) enter now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomasin has not been able to come, as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) promised to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) replied
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) inquiry, which had been anxious, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) niece was
badly in want of money. <div class="bookquote">``The captain came down last night and
personally pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to join them today. So, not to be unpleasant,
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) determined to go. They fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) in the pony-chaise, and are
going to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``Have they gone to their new
home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I have had no news from Mistover since Thomasin left to
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not go with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), as if there might be good reasons
why.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, reddening slightly. <div class="bookquote">``We could not both
leave the house; it was rather a busy morning, on account of Anglebury
Great Market. I believe you have something to give to Thomasin? If you
like, I will take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright hesitated, and wondered if Wildeve knew what the
something was. <div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) tell you of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not particularly. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) casually dropped a remark about having arranged
to fetch some article or other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hardly necessary to send it. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) can have it whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) chooses
to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That won't be yet. In the present state of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) health she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) must not go
on walking so much as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has done.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) added, with a faint twang of
sarcasm, <div class="bookquote">``What wonderful thing is it that I cannot be trusted to take?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing worth troubling you with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One would think you doubted my honesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said, with a laugh, though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) colour rose in a quick resentfulness frequent with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need think no such thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) drily. <div class="bookquote">``It is simply that I,
in common with the rest of the world, feel that there are certain things
which had better be done by certain people than by others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you like, as you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve laconically. <div class="bookquote">``It is not worth
arguing about. Well, I think I must turn homeward again, as the inn must
not be left long in charge of the lad and the maid only.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) way, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) farewell being scarcely so courteous as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
greeting. But Mrs. Yeobright knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) thoroughly by this time, and took
little notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) manner, good or bad.

<p/>When Wildeve was gone Mrs. Yeobright stood and considered what would be
the best course to adopt with regard to the guineas, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had not
liked to entrust to Wildeve. It was hardly credible that Thomasin had
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) to ask for them, when the necessity for them had arisen
from the difficulty of obtaining money at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hands. At the same time
Thomasin really wanted them, and might be unable to come to Blooms-End
for another week at least. To take or send the money to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) at the inn
would be impolite, since Wildeve would pretty surely be present, or
would discover the transaction; and if, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt suspected, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) less kindly than she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) deserved to be treated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) might
then get the whole sum out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) gentle hands. But on this particular
evening Thomasin was at Mistover, and anything might be conveyed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) there without the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) husband. Upon the whole the
opportunity was worth taking advantage of.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son, too, was there, and was now married. There could be no more
proper moment to render him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) share of the money than the present.
And the chance that would be afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), by sending him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) this gift,
of showing how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was from bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ill-will, cheered the sad
mother's heart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) went upstairs and took from a locked drawer a little box, out of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) poured a hoard of broad unworn guineas that had lain there
many a year. There were a hundred in all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) divided them into two
heaps, fifty in each. Tying up these in small canvas bags, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) went down
to the garden and called to Christian Cantle, who was loitering about in
hope of a supper which was not really owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>). Mrs. Yeobright gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) the moneybags, charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) to go to Mistover, and on no account
to deliver them into any one's hands save her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son's and Thomasin's. On
further thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) deemed it advisable to tell Christian precisely
what the two bags contained, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) might be fully impressed with their
importance. Christian pocketed the moneybags, promised the greatest
carefulness, and set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``It will be better not to get
there till after dusk, and then nobody will notice you. Come back here
to supper, if it is not too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was nearly nine o’clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) began to ascend the vale towards
Mistover; but the long days of summer being at their climax, the first
obscurity of evening had only just begun to tan the landscape. At
this point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) journey Christian heard voices, and found that they
proceeded from a company of men and women who were traversing a hollow
ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), the tops only of their heads being visible.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) paused and thought of the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) carried. It was almost too early
even for Christian seriously to fear robbery; nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) took
a precaution which ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) boyhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had adopted whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
carried more than two or three shillings upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) person--a precaution
somewhat like that of the owner of the Pitt Diamond when filled with
similar misgivings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) boots, untied the guineas, and
emptied the contents of one little bag into the right boot, and of
the other into the left, spreading them as flatly as possible over the
bottom of each, which was really a spacious coffer by no means limited
to the size of the foot. Pulling them on again and lacing them to the
very top, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) proceeded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) way, more easy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) head than under his (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>)
soles.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) path converged towards that of the noisy company, and on coming
nearer he (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) found to his (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) relief that they were several Egdon people whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) knew very well, while with them walked Fairway, of Blooms-End.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Christian going too?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Fairway as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) recognized the
newcomer. <div class="bookquote">``You've got no young woman nor wife to your name to gie a
gown-piece to, I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What d’ye mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the raffle. The one we go to every year. Going to the raffle as
well as ourselves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never knew a word o't. Is it like cudgel playing or other sportful
forms of bloodshed? I don't want to go, thank you, Mister Fairway, and
no offence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Christian don't know the fun o't, and `twould be a fine sight for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said a buxom woman. <div class="bookquote">``There's no danger at all, Christian. Every man
puts in a shilling apiece, and one wins a gown-piece for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) wife or
sweetheart if he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)'s got one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as that's not my fortune there's no meaning in it to me. But I
should like to see the fun, if there's nothing of the black art in it,
and if a man may look on without cost or getting into any dangerous
wrangle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be no uproar at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy/Timothy Fairway</b></font>)</div>said Timothy. <div class="bookquote">``Sure, Christian, if
you'd like to come we'll see there's no harm done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And no ba'dy gaieties, I suppose? You see, neighbours, if so, it
would be setting father a bad example, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is so light moral'd. But
a gown-piece for a shilling, and no black art--`tis worth looking in to
see, and it wouldn't hinder me half an hour. Yes, I'll come, if you'll
step a little way towards Mistover with me afterwards, supposing night
should have closed in, and nobody else is going that way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One or two promised; and Christian, diverging from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) direct path,
turned round to the right with his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) companions towards the Quiet Woman.

<p/>When they entered the large common room of the inn they found assembled
there about ten men from among the neighbouring population, and the
group was increased by the new contingent to double that number. Most of
them were sitting round the room in seats divided by wooden elbows like
those of crude cathedral stalls, which were carved with the initials of
many an illustrious drunkard of former times who had passed his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) days
and his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) nights between them, and now lay as an alcoholic cinder in the
nearest churchyard. Among the cups on the long table before the
sitters lay an open parcel of light drapery--the gown-piece, as it was
called--which was to be raffled for. Wildeve was standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) back
to the fireplace smoking a cigar; and the promoter of the raffle, a
packman from a distant town, was expatiating upon the value of the
fabric as material for a summer dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>promoter</b></font>) continued, as the newcomers drew up to the table,
<div class="bookquote">``there's five have entered, and we want four more to make up the number.
I think, by the faces of those gentlemen who have just come in, that
they are shrewd enough to take advantage of this rare opportunity of
beautifying their ladies at a very trifling expense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the newcomers</b></font>)</div><p/>Fairway, Sam, and another placed their shillings on the table, and the
man turned to Christian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian, drawing back, with a quick gaze of misgiving.
<div class="bookquote">``I am only a poor chap come to look on, an it please ye, sir. I don't
so much as know how you do it. If so be I was sure of getting it I would
put down the shilling; but I couldn't otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you might almost be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the pedlar</b></font>)</div>said the pedlar. <div class="bookquote">``In fact, now I
look into your face, even if I can't say you are sure to win, I can say
that I never saw anything look more like winning in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll anyhow have the same chance as the rest of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the extra luck of being the last comer,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I was born wi' a caul, and perhaps can be no more ruined than
drowned?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>Christian added, beginning to give way.

<p/>Ultimately Christian laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) shilling, the raffle began, and the
dice went round. When it came to Christian's turn he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) took the box with a
trembling hand, shook it fearfully, and threw a pair-royal. Three of the
others had thrown common low pairs, and all the rest mere points.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The gentleman looked like winning, as I said,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed the chapman
blandly. <div class="bookquote">``Take it, sir; the article is yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haw-haw-haw!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``I'm damned if this isn't the quarest start
that ever I knowed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>asked Christian, with a vacant stare from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) target eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I--I
haven't got neither maid, wife, nor widder belonging to me at all, and
I'm afeard it will make me laughed at to ha’e it, Master Traveller. What
with being curious to join in I never thought of that! What shall I do
wi' a woman's clothes in MY bedroom, and not lose my decency!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep `em, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway, <div class="bookquote">``if it is only for luck. Perhaps
`twill tempt some woman that thy poor carcase had no power over when
standing empty-handed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep it, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, who had idly watched the scene from
a distance.

<p/>The table was then cleared of the articles, and the men began to drink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian, half to himself. <div class="bookquote">``To think I should
have been born so lucky as this, and not have found it out until now!
What curious creatures these dice be--powerful rulers of us all, and
yet at my command! I am sure I never need be afeared of anything after
this.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) handled the dice fondly one by one. <div class="bookquote">``Why, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) said in a
confidential whisper to Wildeve, who was near his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) left hand, <div class="bookquote">``if I could
only use this power that's in me of multiplying money I might do some
good to a near relation of yours, seeing what I've got about me of
hers--eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) tapped one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) money-laden boots upon the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a secret. Well, I must be going now.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) looked anxiously
towards Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>Wildeve asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Mistover Knap. I have to see Mrs. Thomasin there--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going there, too, to fetch Mrs. Wildeve. We can walk together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve became lost in thought, and a look of inward illumination came
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) eyes. It was money for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife that Mrs. Yeobright could not
trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) with. <div class="bookquote">``Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) could trust this fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said to himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Why doesn't that which belongs to the wife belong to the husband too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) called to the pot-boy to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hat, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Now,
Christian, I am ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wildeve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian timidly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) turned to leave the room,
<div class="bookquote">``would you mind lending me them wonderful little things that carry my
luck inside `em, that I might practise a bit by myself, you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
looked wistfully at the dice and box lying on the mantlepiece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``They were only cut out by some
lad with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) knife, and are worth nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>And Christian went back and
privately pocketed them.

<p/>Wildeve opened the door and looked out. The night was warm and cloudy.
<div class="bookquote">``By Gad! `tis dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``But I suppose we shall find our
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we should lose the path it might be awkward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian. <div class="bookquote">``A
lantern is the only shield that will make it safe for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's have a lantern by all means.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The stable lantern was fetched and
lighted. Christian took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) gownpiece, and the two set out to ascend
the hill.

<p/>Within the room the men fell into chat till their attention was for a
moment drawn to the chimney-corner. This was large, and, in addition
to its proper recess, contained within its jambs, like many on Egdon, a
receding seat, so that a person might sit there absolutely unobserved,
provided there was no fire to light him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) up, as was the case now and
throughout the summer. From the niche a single object protruded into the
light from the candles on the table. It was a clay pipe, and its colour
was reddish. The men had been attracted to this object by a voice behind
the pipe asking for a light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my life, it fairly startled me when the man spoke!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway,
handing a candle. <div class="bookquote">``Oh--`tis the reddleman! You've kept a quiet tongue,
young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I had nothing to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Venn. In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) arose
and wished the company good night.

<p/>Meanwhile Wildeve and Christian had plunged into the heath.

<p/>It was a stagnant, warm, and misty night, full of all the heavy perfumes
of new vegetation not yet dried by hot sun, and among these particularly
the scent of the fern. The lantern, dangling from Christian's hand,
brushed the feathery fronds in passing by, disturbing moths and other
winged insects, which flew out and alighted upon its horny panes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you have money to carry to Mrs. Wildeve?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian's
companion, after a silence. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think it very odd that it
shouldn't be given to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As man and wife be one flesh, `twould have been all the same, I should
think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian. <div class="bookquote">``But my strict documents was, to give the money
into Mrs. Wildeve's hand--and `tis well to do things right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. Any person who had known the circumstances
might have perceived that Wildeve was mortified by the discovery that
the matter in transit was money, and not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had supposed when at
Blooms-End, some fancy nick-nack which only interested the two women
themselves. Mrs. Yeobright's refusal implied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) honour was not
considered to be of sufficiently good quality to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) a safer bearer
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife's property.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very warm it is tonight, Christian!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said, panting, when they
were nearly under Rainbarrow. <div class="bookquote">``Let us sit down for a few minutes, for
Heaven's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve flung himself down on the soft ferns; and Christian, placing the
lantern and parcel on the ground, perched himself in a cramped position
hard by, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) knees almost touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) chin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) presently thrust one
hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) coat-pocket and began shaking it about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you rattling in there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only the dice, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian, quickly withdrawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``What magical machines these little things be, Mr. Wildeve! `Tis a
game I should never get tired of. Would you mind my taking `em out and
looking at `em for a minute, to see how they are made? I didn't like
to look close before the other men, for fear they should think it bad
manners in me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>Christian took them out and examined them in the hollow
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) hand by the lantern light. <div class="bookquote">``That these little things should carry
such luck, and such charm, and such a spell, and such power in `em,
passes all I ever heard or zeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) went on, with a fascinated gaze at
the dice, which, as is frequently the case in country places, were made
of wood, the points being burnt upon each face with the end of a wire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are a great deal in a small compass, You think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Do ye suppose they really be the devil's playthings, Mr. Wildeve?
If so, `tis no good sign that I be such a lucky man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to win some money, now that you've got them. Any woman would
marry you then. Now is your time, Christian, and I would recommend you
not to let it slip. Some men are born to luck, some are not. I belong to
the latter class.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever know anybody who was born to it besides myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes. I once heard of an Italian, who sat down at a gaming table with
only a louis, -LRB-that's a foreign sovereign-RRB-, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) played on
for twenty-four hours, and won ten thousand pounds, stripping the
bank he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had played against. Then there was another man who had lost a
thousand pounds, and went to the broker's next day to sell stock, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might pay the debt. The man to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owed the money went with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
in a hackney-coach; and to pass the time they tossed who should pay
the fare. The ruined man won, and the other was tempted to continue the
game, and they played all the way. When the coachman stopped he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was told
to drive home again: the whole thousand pounds had been won back by the
man who was going to sell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha--ha--splendid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Christian. <div class="bookquote">``Go on--go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there was a man of London, who was only a waiter at White's
clubhouse. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) began playing first half-crown stakes, and then higher and
higher, till he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) became very rich, got an appointment in India, and rose
to be Governor of Madras. His (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) daughter married a member of Parliament,
and the Bishop of Carlisle stood godfather to one of the children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonderful! wonderful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And once there was a young man in America who gambled till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last dollar. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) staked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch and chain, and lost as before;
staked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) umbrella, lost again; staked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, lost again; staked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
coat and stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shirt-sleeves, lost again. Began taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
breeches, and then a looker-on gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a trifle for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pluck. With
this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won. Won back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat, won back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, won back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) umbrella,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, and went out of the door a rich man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, `tis too good--it takes away my breath! Mr. Wildeve, I think I will
try another shilling with you, as I am one of that sort; no danger can
come o't, and you can afford to lose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, rising. Searching about with the lantern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
found a large flat stone, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) placed between himself and Christian,
and sat down again. The lantern was opened to give more light, and it's
rays directed upon the stone. Christian put down a shilling, Wildeve
another, and each threw. Christian won. They played for two, Christian
won again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us try four,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. They played for four. This time the
stakes were won by Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, those little accidents will, of course, sometimes happen, to the
luckiest man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I have no more money!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>explained Christian excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``And yet,
if I could go on, I should get it back again, and more. I wish this was
mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) boot upon the ground, so that the guineas chinked
within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you have not put Mrs. Wildeve's money there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. `Tis for safety. Is it any harm to raffle with a married lady's
money when, if I win, I shall only keep my winnings, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
own all the same; and if t'other man wins, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) money will go to the
lawful owner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve had been brooding ever since they started on the mean estimation
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was held by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife's friends; and it cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) heart
severely. As the minutes passed he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had gradually drifted into a
revengeful intention without knowing the precise moment of forming it.
This was to teach Mrs. Yeobright a lesson, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) considered it to be;
in other words, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) could that her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) niece's husband was the
proper guardian of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) niece's money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, here goes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian, beginning to unlace one boot. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall dream of it nights and nights, I suppose; but I shall always swear
my flesh don't crawl when I think o't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) hand into the boot and withdrew one of poor Thomasin's
precious guineas, piping hot. Wildeve had already placed a sovereign on
the stone. The game was then resumed. Wildeve won first, and Christian
ventured another, winning himself this time. The game fluctuated, but
the average was in Wildeve's favour. Both men became so absorbed in
the game that they took no heed of anything but the pigmy objects
immediately beneath their eyes, the flat stone, the open lantern, the
dice, and the few illuminated fern-leaves which lay under the light,
were the whole world to them.

<p/>At length Christian lost rapidly; and presently, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) horror, the
whole fifty guineas belonging to Thomasin had been handed over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
adversary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care--I don't care!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) moaned, and desperately set about
untying his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) left boot to get at the other fifty. <div class="bookquote">``The devil will toss me
into the flames on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) three-pronged fork for this night's work, I know!
But perhaps I shall win yet, and then I'll get a wife to sit up with
me o' nights and I won't be afeard, I won't! Here's another for'ee, my
man!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) slapped another guinea down upon the stone, and the dice-box
was rattled again.

<p/>Time passed on. Wildeve began to be as excited as Christian himself.
When commencing the game his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) intention had been nothing further than
a bitter practical joke on Mrs. Yeobright. To win the money, fairly
or otherwise, and to hand it contemptuously to Thomasin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) aunt's
presence, had been the dim outline of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) purpose. But men are drawn
from their intentions even in the course of carrying them out, and
it was extremely doubtful, by the time the twentieth guinea had been
reached, whether Wildeve was conscious of any other intention than that
of winning for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) own personal benefit. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was now no longer
gambling for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife's money, but for Yeobright's; though of this fact
Christian, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) apprehensiveness, did not inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) till afterwards.

<p/>It was nearly eleven o’clock, when, with almost a shriek, Christian
placed Yeobright's last gleaming guinea upon the stone. In thirty
seconds it had gone the way of its companions.

<p/>Christian turned and flung himself on the ferns in a convulsion of
remorse, <div class="bookquote">``O, what shall I do with my wretched self?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) groaned. <div class="bookquote">``What
shall I do? Will any good Heaven hae mercy upon my wicked soul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do? Live on just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't live on just the same! I'll die! I say you are a--a--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man sharper than my neighbour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a man sharper than my neighbour; a regular sharper!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor chips-in-porridge, you are very unmannerly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that! And I say you be unmannerly! You've got money
that isn't your own. Half the guineas are poor Mr. Clym's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I had to gie fifty of `em to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Mrs. Yeobright said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh?... Well, `twould have been more graceful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) to have given them
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wife Eustacia. But they are in my hands now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div><p/>Christian pulled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) boots, and with heavy breathings, which could be
heard to some distance, dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) limbs together, arose, and tottered
away out of sight. Wildeve set about shutting the lantern to return to
the house, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) deemed it too late to go to Mistover to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife,
who was to be driven home in the captain's four-wheel. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was
closing the little horn door a figure rose from behind a neighbouring
bush and came forward into the lantern light. It was the reddleman
approaching.




<p/>8--A New Force Disturbs the Current


<p/>Wildeve stared. Venn looked coolly towards Wildeve, and, without a word
being spoken, he (<font color='blue'><b>bush</b></font>) deliberately sat himself down where Christian had been
seated, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) pocket, drew out a sovereign, and laid
it on the stone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been watching us from behind that bush?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/>The reddleman nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Down with your stake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Or haven't you
pluck enough to go on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, gambling is a species of amusement which is much more easily begun
with full pockets than left off with the same; and though Wildeve in
a cooler temper might have prudently declined this invitation, the
excitement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) recent success carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) completely away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) placed
one of the guineas on a slab beside the reddleman's sovereign. <div class="bookquote">``Mine is
a guinea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A guinea that's not your own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Venn sarcastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>answered Wildeve haughtily. <div class="bookquote">``It is my wife's, and what
is hers is mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; let's make a beginning.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) shook the box, and threw eight,
ten, and nine; the three casts amounted to twenty-seven.

<p/>This encouraged Wildeve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) took the box; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) three casts amounted
to forty-five.

<p/>Down went another of the reddleman's sovereigns against his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) first one
which Wildeve laid. This time Wildeve threw fifty-one points, but no
pair. The reddleman looked grim, threw a raffle of aces, and pocketed
the stakes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``Double the stakes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) laid two of Thomasin's guineas, and the reddleman his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) two pounds.
Venn won again. New stakes were laid on the stone, and the gamblers
proceeded as before.

<p/>Wildeve was a nervous and excitable man, and the game was beginning
to tell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) writhed, fumed, shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) seat, and the
beating of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) heart was almost audible. Venn sat with lips impassively
closed and eyes reduced to a pair of unimportant twinkles; he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) scarcely
appeared to breathe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) might have been an Arab, or an automaton; he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
would have been like a red sandstone statue but for the motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
arm with the dice-box.

<p/>The game fluctuated, now in favour of one, now in favour of the other,
without any great advantage on the side of either. Nearly twenty minutes
were passed thus. The light of the candle had by this time attracted
heath-flies, moths, and other winged creatures of night, which floated
round the lantern, flew into the flame, or beat about the faces of the
two players.

<p/>But neither of the men paid much attention to these things, their eyes
being concentrated upon the little flat stone, which to them was an
arena vast and important as a battlefield. By this time a change had
come over the game; the reddleman won continually. At length sixty
guineas--Thomasin's fifty, and ten of Clym's--had passed into his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hands.
Wildeve was reckless, frantic, exasperated.

<p/>```Won back his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) coat,''' said Venn slily.

<p/>Another throw, and the money went the same way.

<p/>```Won back his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hat,''' continued Venn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/>```Won back his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) watch, won back his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) money, and went out of the door a
rich man,''' added Venn sentence by sentence, as stake after stake passed
over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Five more!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted Wildeve, dashing down the money. <div class="bookquote">``And three casts
be hanged--one shall decide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The red automaton opposite lapsed into silence, nodded, and followed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) example. Wildeve rattled the box, and threw a pair of sixes and five
points. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hands; <div class="bookquote">``I have done it this time--hurrah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two playing, and only one has thrown,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman,
quietly bringing down the box. The eyes of each were then so intently
converged upon the stone that one could fancy their beams were visible,
like rays in a fog.

<p/>Venn lifted the box, and behold a triplet of sixes was disclosed.

<p/>Wildeve was full of fury. While the reddleman was grasping the stakes
Wildeve seized the dice and hurled them, box and all, into the darkness,
uttering a fearful imprecation. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) arose and began stamping up and
down like a madman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all over, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``I mean to have another chance yet. I must!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my good man, what have you done with the dice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I threw them away--it was a momentary irritation. What a fool I am!
Here--come and help me to look for them--we must find them again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve snatched up the lantern and began anxiously prowling among the
furze and fern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not likely to find them there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn, following. <div class="bookquote">``What did
you do such a crazy thing as that for? Here's the box. The dice can't be
far off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve turned the light eagerly upon the spot where Venn had found
the box, and mauled the herbage right and left. In the course of a few
minutes one of the dice was found. They searched on for some time, but
no other was to be seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve; <div class="bookquote">``let's play with one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Agreed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn.

<p/>Down they sat again, and recommenced with single guinea stakes; and the
play went on smartly. But Fortune had unmistakably fallen in love
with the reddleman tonight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) won steadily, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was the owner of
fourteen more of the gold pieces. Seventy-nine of the hundred guineas
were his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), Wildeve possessing only twenty-one. The aspect of the two
opponents was now singular. Apart from motions, a complete diorama
of the fluctuations of the game went on in their eyes. A diminutive
candle-flame was mirrored in each pupil, and it would have been possible
to distinguish therein between the moods of hope and the moods of
abandonment, even as regards the reddleman, though his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) facial muscles
betrayed nothing at all. Wildeve played on with the recklessness of
despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) suddenly exclaimed, hearing a rustle; and they both
looked up.

<p/>They were surrounded by dusky forms between four and five feet high,
standing a few paces beyond the rays of the lantern. A moment's
inspection revealed that the encircling figures were heath-croppers,
their heads being all towards the players, at whom they gazed intently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hoosh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, and the whole forty or fifty animals at once
turned and galloped away. Play was again resumed.

<p/>Ten minutes passed away. Then a large death's head moth advanced from
the obscure outer air, wheeled twice round the lantern, flew straight
at the candle, and extinguished it by the force of the blow. Wildeve had
just thrown, but had not lifted the box to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had cast; and now
it was impossible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the infernal!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) shrieked. <div class="bookquote">``Now, what shall we do? Perhaps I have
thrown six--have you any matches?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Christian had some--I wonder where he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is. Christian!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>But there was no reply to Wildeve's shout, save a mournful whining
from the herons which were nesting lower down the vale. Both men looked
blankly round without rising. As their eyes grew accustomed to the
darkness they perceived faint greenish points of light among the
grass and fern. These lights dotted the hillside like stars of a low
magnitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--glowworms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute. We can continue the
game.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn sat still, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) companion went hither and thither till he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had
gathered thirteen glowworms--as many as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) could find in a space of four
or five minutes--upon a fox-glove leaf which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) pulled for the purpose.
The reddleman vented a low humorous laugh when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) adversary
return with these. <div class="bookquote">``Determined to go on, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve angrily. And shaking the glowworms from
the leaf he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) ranged them with a trembling hand in a circle on the stone,
leaving a space in the middle for the descent of the dice-box, over
which the thirteen tiny lamps threw a pale phosphoric shine. The game
was again renewed. It happened to be that season of the year at which
glowworms put forth their greatest brilliancy, and the light they
yielded was more than ample for the purpose, since it is possible on
such nights to read the handwriting of a letter by the light of two or
three.

<p/>The incongruity between the men's deeds and their environment was great.
Amid the soft juicy vegetation of the hollow in which they sat, the
motionless and the uninhabited solitude, intruded the chink of guineas,
the rattle of dice, the exclamations of the reckless players.

<p/>Wildeve had lifted the box as soon as the lights were obtained, and the
solitary die proclaimed that the game was still against him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't play any more--you've been tampering with the dice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How--when they were your own?''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll change the game: the lowest point shall win the stake--it may cut
off my ill luck. Do you refuse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, there they are again--damn them!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Wildeve, looking up. The
heath-croppers had returned noiselessly, and were looking on with erect
heads just as before, their timid eyes fixed upon the scene, as if they
were wondering what mankind and candlelight could have to do in these
haunts at this untoward hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a plague those creatures are--staring at me so!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said, and
flung a stone, which scattered them; when the game was continued as
before.

<p/>Wildeve had now ten guineas left; and each laid five. Wildeve threw
three points; Venn two, and raked in the coins. The other seized the
die, and clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) teeth upon it in sheer rage, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would bite
it in pieces. <div class="bookquote">``Never give in--here are my last five!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) cried, throwing
them down. <div class="bookquote">``Hang the glowworms--they are going out. Why don't you burn,
you little fools? Stir them up with a thorn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) probed the glowworms with a bit of stick, and rolled them over, till
the bright side of their tails was upwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's light enough. Throw on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Venn.

<p/>Wildeve brought down the box within the shining circle and looked
eagerly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had thrown ace. <div class="bookquote">``Well done!--I said it would turn, and it
has turned.''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>Venn said nothing; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) hand shook slightly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) threw ace also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``Curse me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The die smacked the stone a second time. It was ace again. Venn looked
gloomy, threw--the die was seen to be lying in two pieces, the cleft
sides uppermost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've thrown nothing at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Serves me right--I split the die with my teeth. Here--take your money.
Blank is less than one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it, I say--you've won it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>And Wildeve threw the stakes against
the reddleman's chest. Venn gathered them up, arose, and withdrew from
the hollow, Wildeve sitting stupefied.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had come to himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) also arose, and, with the extinguished
lantern in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hand, went towards the highroad. On reaching it he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) stood
still. The silence of night pervaded the whole heath except in one
direction; and that was towards Mistover. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) could hear the noise
of light wheels, and presently saw two carriagelamps descending the
hill. Wildeve screened himself under a bush and waited.

<p/>The vehicle came on and passed before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). It was a hired carriage,
and behind the coachman were two persons whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) knew well. There sat
Eustacia and Yeobright, the arm of the latter being round her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) waist.
They turned the sharp corner at the bottom towards the temporary home
which Clym had hired and furnished, about five miles to the eastward.

<p/>Wildeve forgot the loss of the money at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) lost love,
whose preciousness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) eyes was increasing in geometrical progression
with each new incident that reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) of their hopeless division.
Brimming with the subtilized misery that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was capable of feeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
followed the opposite way towards the inn.

<p/>About the same moment that Wildeve stepped into the highway Venn also
had reached it at a point a hundred yards further on; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), hearing
the same wheels, likewise waited till the carriage should come up. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) saw who sat therein he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) seemed to be disappointed. Reflecting a minute
or two, during which interval the carriage rolled on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) crossed the
road, and took a short cut through the furze and heath to a point where
the turnpike road bent round in ascending a hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was now again in
front of the carriage, which presently came up at a walking pace. Venn
stepped forward and showed himself.

<p/>Eustacia started when the lamp shone upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>), and Clym's arm was
involuntarily withdrawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) waist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What, Diggory? You are
having a lonely walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I beg your pardon for stopping you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn. <div class="bookquote">``But I am
waiting about for Mrs. Wildeve: I have something to give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) from Mrs.
Yeobright. Can you tell me if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s gone home from the party yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will be leaving soon. You may possibly meet her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at the
corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn made a farewell obeisance, and walked back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) former position,
where the byroad from Mistover joined the highway. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) remained
fixed for nearly half an hour, and then another pair of lights came down
the hill. It was the old-fashioned wheeled nondescript belonging to the
captain, and Thomasin sat in it alone, driven by Charley.

<p/>The reddleman came up as they slowly turned the corner. <div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon
for stopping you, Mrs. Wildeve,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I have something to
give you privately from Mrs. Yeobright.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) handed a small parcel; it
consisted of the hundred guineas he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had just won, roughly twisted up in
a piece of paper.

<p/>Thomasin recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) surprise, and took the packet. <div class="bookquote">``That's all,
ma’am--I wish you good night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said, and vanished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) view.

<p/>Thus Venn, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) anxiety to rectify matters, had placed in Thomasin's
hands not only the fifty guineas which rightly belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), but also
the fifty intended for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) cousin Clym. His (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mistake had been based upon
Wildeve's words at the opening of the game, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) indignantly denied
that the guinea was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) own. It had not been comprehended by the
reddleman that at halfway through the performance the game was continued
with the money of another person; and it was an error which afterwards
helped to cause more misfortune than treble the loss in money value
could have done.

<p/>The night was now somewhat advanced; and Venn plunged deeper into the
heath, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) came to a ravine where his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) van was standing--a spot
not more than two hundred yards from the site of the gambling bout. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
entered this movable home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>), lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) lantern, and, before closing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) door for the night, stood reflecting on the circumstances of the
preceding hours. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) stood the dawn grew visible in the northeast
quarter of the heavens, which, the clouds having cleared off, was bright
with a soft sheen at this midsummer time, though it was only between one
and two o’clock. Venn, thoroughly weary, then shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) door and flung
himself down to sleep.





<p/>BOOK FOUR -- THE CLOSED DOOR




<p/>1--The Rencounter by the Pool


<p/>The July sun shone over Egdon and fired its crimson heather to scarlet.
It was the one season of the year, and the one weather of the season,
in which the heath was gorgeous. This flowering period represented the
second or noontide division in the cycle of those superficial changes
which alone were possible here; it followed the green or young-fern
period, representing the morn, and preceded the brown period, when the
heathbells and ferns would wear the russet tinges of evening; to be in
turn displaced by the dark hue of the winter period, representing night.

<p/>Clym and Eustacia, in their little house at Alderworth, beyond East
Egdon, were living on with a monotony which was delightful to them. The
heath and changes of weather were quite blotted out from their eyes for
the present. They were enclosed in a sort of luminous mist, which hid
from them surroundings of any inharmonious colour, and gave to all
things the character of light. When it rained they were charmed, because
they could remain indoors together all day with such a show of reason;
when it was fine they were charmed, because they could sit together on
the hills. They were like those double stars which revolve round and
round each other, and from a distance appear to be one. The absolute
solitude in which they lived intensified their reciprocal thoughts; yet
some might have said that it had the disadvantage of consuming their
mutual affections at a fearfully prodigal rate. Yeobright did not fear
for his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own part; but recollection of Eustacia's old speech about the
evanescence of love, now apparently forgotten by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), sometimes caused
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to ask himself a question; and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) recoiled at the thought that the
quality of finiteness was not foreign to Eden.

<p/>When three or four weeks had been passed thus, Yeobright resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
reading in earnest. To make up for lost time he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) studied indefatigably,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wished to enter his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) new profession with the least possible delay.

<p/>Now, Eustacia's dream had always been that, once married to Clym,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would have the power of inducing him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to return to Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
carefully withheld all promise to do so; but would he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) be proof against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) coaxing and argument? She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had calculated to such a degree on the
probability of success that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had represented Paris, and not Budmouth,
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather as in all likelihood their future home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hopes
were bound up in this dream. In the quiet days since their marriage,
when Yeobright had been poring over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lips, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes, and the lines of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had mused and mused on the subject, even while in the
act of returning his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) gaze; and now the sight of the books, indicating a
future which was antagonistic to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) dream, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) with a positively
painful jar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was hoping for the time when, as the mistress of some
pretty establishment, however small, near a Parisian Boulevard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
would be passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) days on the skirts at least of the gay world, and
catching stray wafts from those town pleasures she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was so well fitted
to enjoy. Yet Yeobright was as firm in the contrary intention as if
the tendency of marriage were rather to develop the fantasies of young
philanthropy than to sweep them away.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) anxiety reached a high pitch; but there was something in Clym's
undeviating manner which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hesitate before sounding him (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) on the
subject. At this point in their experience, however, an incident helped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). It occurred one evening about six weeks after their union, and
arose entirely out of the unconscious misapplication of Venn of the
fifty guineas intended for Yeobright.

<p/>A day or two after the receipt of the money Thomasin had sent a note to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) aunt to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had been surprised at the largeness of the
amount; but as no sum had ever been mentioned she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) set that down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
late uncle's generosity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had been strictly charged by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) aunt to
say nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband of this gift; and Wildeve, as was natural
enough, had not brought himself to mention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife a single
particular of the midnight scene in the heath. Christian's terror,
in like manner, had tied his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) tongue on the share he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) took in that
proceeding; and hoping that by some means or other the money had gone
to its proper destination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) simply asserted as much, without giving
details.

<p/>Therefore, when a week or two had passed away, Mrs. Yeobright began to
wonder why she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) never heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son of the receipt of the present;
and to add gloom to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) perplexity came the possibility that resentment
might be the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could hardly believe as much, but
why did he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) not write? She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) questioned Christian, and the confusion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
answers would at once have led her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) to believe that something was wrong,
had not one-half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) story been corroborated by Thomasin's note.

<p/>Mrs. Yeobright was in this state of uncertainty when she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was informed
one morning that her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son's wife was visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) grandfather at
Mistover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) determined to walk up the hill, see Eustacia, and
ascertain from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) daughter-in-law's lips whether the family guineas,
which were to Mrs. Yeobright what family jewels are to wealthier
dowagers, had miscarried or not.

<p/>When Christian learnt where she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was going his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) concern reached its
height. At the moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) departure he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could prevaricate no longer,
and, confessing to the gambling, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) the truth as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) knew
it--that the guineas had been won by Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) going to keep them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Yeobright cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope and trust not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>moaned Christian. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a good man, and perhaps
will do right things. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said you ought to have gied Mr. Clym's share to
Eustacia, and that's perhaps what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'ll do himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>To Mrs. Yeobright, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could calmly reflect, there was much
likelihood in this, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) could hardly believe that Wildeve would
really appropriate money belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son. The intermediate course
of giving it to Eustacia was the sort of thing to please Wildeve's
fancy. But it filled the mother with anger none the less. That Wildeve
should have got command of the guineas after all, and should rearrange
the disposal of them, placing Clym's share in Clym's wife's hands,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) own sweetheart, and might be so still, was as
irritating a pain as any that Mrs. Yeobright had ever borne.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) instantly dismissed the wretched Christian from her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) employ for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
conduct in the affair; but, feeling quite helpless and unable to do
without him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), told him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) might stay a little longer
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) chose. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) hastened off to Eustacia, moved by a much less
promising emotion towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) daughter-in-law than she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had felt half an
hour earlier, when planning her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) journey. At that time it was to inquire
in a friendly spirit if there had been any accidental loss; now it was
to ask plainly if Wildeve had privately given her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) money which had been
intended as a sacred gift to Clym.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) started at two o’clock, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) meeting with Eustacia was hastened
by the appearance of the young lady beside the pool and bank which
bordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather's premises, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stood surveying the
scene, and perhaps thinking of the romantic enactments it had witnessed
in past days. When Mrs. Yeobright approached, Eustacia surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) with
the calm stare of a stranger.

<p/>The mother-in-law was the first to speak. <div class="bookquote">``I was coming to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia with surprise, for Mrs. Yeobright, much to the
girl's mortification, had refused to be present at the wedding. <div class="bookquote">``I did
not at all expect you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was coming on business only,''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>said the visitor, more coldly than at
first. <div class="bookquote">``Will you excuse my asking this--Have you received a gift from
Thomasin's husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A gift?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean money!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--I myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I meant yourself, privately--though I was not going to put it in
that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Money from Mr. Wildeve? No--never! Madam, what do you mean by that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>Eustacia fired up all too quickly, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own consciousness of the old
attachment between herself and Wildeve led her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to jump to the conclusion
that Mrs. Yeobright also knew of it, and might have come to accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
of receiving dishonourable presents from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I simply ask the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``I have been--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have better opinions of me--I feared you were against me
from the first!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Eustacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I was simply for Clym,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Yeobright, with too much
emphasis in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) earnestness. <div class="bookquote">``It is the instinct of everyone to look
after their own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) required guarding against me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>cried
Eustacia, passionate tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I have not injured him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) by
marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)! What sin have I done that you should think so ill of me?
You had no right to speak against me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) when I have never wronged
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only did what was fair under the circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright
more softly. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather not have gone into this question at
present, but you compel me. I am not ashamed to tell you the honest
truth. I was firmly convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) ought not to marry you--therefore
I tried to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) by all the means in my power. But it is done
now, and I have no idea of complaining any more. I am ready to welcome
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes, it is very well to see things in that business point of view,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>murmured Eustacia with a smothered fire of feeling. <div class="bookquote">``But why should you
think there is anything between me and Mr. Wildeve? I have a spirit
as well as you. I am indignant; and so would any woman be. It was a
condescension in me to be Clym's wife, and not a manoeuvre, let me
remind you; and therefore I will not be treated as a schemer whom it
becomes necessary to bear with because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has crept into the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright, vainly endeavouring to control her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) anger. <div class="bookquote">``I
have never heard anything to show that my son's lineage is not as
good as the Vyes'--perhaps better. It is amusing to hear you talk of
condescension.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was condescension, nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``And if
I had known then what I know now, that I should be living in this wild
heath a month after my marriage, I--I should have thought twice before
agreeing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be better not to say that; it might not sound truthful. I
am not aware that any deception was used on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) part--I know there was
not--whatever might have been the case on the other side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is too exasperating!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>answered the younger woman huskily, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face
crimsoning, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes darting light. <div class="bookquote">``How can you dare to speak to me
like that? I insist upon repeating to you that had I known that my life
would from my marriage up to this time have been as it is, I should have
said NO. I don't complain. I have never uttered a sound of such a thing
to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but it is true. I hope therefore that in the future you will be
silent on my eagerness. If you injure me now you injure yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Injure you? Do you think I am an evil-disposed person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You injured me before my marriage, and you have now suspected me of
secretly favouring another man for money!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not help what I thought. But I have never spoken of you outside
my house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You spoke of me within it, to Clym, and you could not do worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did my duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll do mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A part of which will possibly be to set him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother. It is
always so. But why should I not bear it as others have borne it before
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia, breathless with emotion. <div class="bookquote">``You
think me capable of every bad thing. Who can be worse than a wife who
encourages a lover, and poisons her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's mind against his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) relative?
Yet that is now the character given to me. Will you not come and drag
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) out of my hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright gave back heat for heat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't rage at me, madam! It ill becomes your beauty, and I am not worth
the injury you may do it on my account, I assure you. I am only a poor
old woman who has lost a son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had treated me honourably you would have had him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>Eustacia said, while scalding tears trickled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You have
brought yourself to folly; you have caused a division which can never be
healed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done nothing. This audacity from a young woman is more than I
can bear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was asked for; you have suspected me, and you have made me speak of
my husband in a way I would not have done. You will let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) know that I
have spoken thus, and it will cause misery between us. Will you go away
from me? You are no friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go when I have spoken a word. If anyone says I have come here to
question you without good grounds for it, that person speaks untruly.
If anyone says that I attempted to stop your marriage by any but honest
means, that person, too, does not speak the truth. I have fallen on an
evil time; God has been unjust to me in letting you insult me! Probably
my son's happiness does not lie on this side of the grave, for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is a
foolish man who neglects the advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) parent. You, Eustacia, stand
on the edge of a precipice without knowing it. Only show my son one-half
the temper you have shown me today--and you may before long--and you
will find that though he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is as gentle as a child with you now, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) can be
as hard as steel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The excited mother then withdrew, and Eustacia, panting, stood looking
into the pool.




<p/>2--He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) Is Set upon by Adversities but He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) Sings a Song


<p/>The result of that unpropitious interview was that Eustacia, instead
of passing the afternoon with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather, hastily returned home to
Clym, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) arrived three hours earlier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had been expected.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) came indoors with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face flushed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes still showing
traces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) recent excitement. Yeobright looked up astonished; he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had
never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in any way approaching to that state before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
passed him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) by, and would have gone upstairs unnoticed, but Clym was so
concerned that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) immediately followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, Eustacia?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was standing on the
hearthrug in the bedroom, looking upon the floor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hands clasped in
front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bonnet yet unremoved. For a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not answer;
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied in a low voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen your mother; and I will never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A weight fell like a stone upon Clym. That same morning, when Eustacia
had arranged to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather, Clym had expressed a wish
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would drive down to Blooms-End and inquire for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mother-in-
law, or adopt any other means she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) might think fit to bring about a
reconciliation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had set out gaily; and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had hoped for much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell--I cannot remember. I met your mother. And I will never
meet her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I know about Mr. Wildeve now? I won't have wicked opinions
passed on me by anybody. O! it was too humiliating to be asked if I
had received any money from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), or encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), or something of the
sort--I don't exactly know what!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) have asked you that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there must have been some meaning in it. What did my mother say
besides?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, except in so far as this, that we both said
words which can never be forgiven!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there must be some misapprehension. Whose fault was it that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
meaning was not made clear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather not say. It may have been the fault of the
circumstances, which were awkward at the very least. O Clym--I cannot
help expressing it--this is an unpleasant position that you have placed
me in. But you must improve it--yes, say you will--for I hate it all
now! Yes, take me to Paris, and go on with your old occupation, Clym! I
don't mind how humbly we live there at first, if it can only be Paris,
and not Egdon Heath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have quite given up that idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright, with surprise.
<div class="bookquote">``Surely I never led you to expect such a thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I own it. Yet there are thoughts which cannot be kept out of mind, and
that one was mine. Must I not have a voice in the matter, now I am your
wife and the sharer of your doom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there are things which are placed beyond the pale of discussion;
and I thought this was specially so, and by mutual agreement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clym, I am unhappy at what I hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said in a low voice; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
eyes drooped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned away.

<p/>This indication of an unexpected mine of hope in Eustacia's bosom
disconcerted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband. It was the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had confronted
the fact of the indirectness of a woman's movement towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desire.
But his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) intention was unshaken, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved Eustacia well. All the
effect that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remark had upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a resolve to chain himself more
closely than ever to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) books, so as to be the sooner enabled to appeal
to substantial results from another course in arguing against her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) whim.

<p/>Next day the mystery of the guineas was explained. Thomasin paid them
a hurried visit, and Clym's share was delivered up to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own
hands. Eustacia was not present at the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then this is what my mother meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Clym. <div class="bookquote">``Thomasin, do you
know that they have had a bitter quarrel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little more reticence now than formerly in Thomasin's manner
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cousin. It is the effect of marriage to engender in several
directions some of the reserve it annihilates in one. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother
told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came back to my house after seeing
Eustacia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The worst thing I dreaded has come to pass. Was Mother much disturbed
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) came to you, Thomasin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym leant his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) elbow upon the post of the garden gate, and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't trouble about it, Clym. They may get to be friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Not two people with inflammable natures like theirs.
Well, what must be will be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One thing is cheerful in it--the guineas are not lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather have lost them twice over than have had this happen.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Amid these jarring events Yeobright felt one thing to be
indispensable--that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should speedily make some show of progress in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
scholastic plans. With this view he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) read far into the small hours during
many nights.

<p/>One morning, after a severer strain than usual, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) awoke with a
strange sensation in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) eyes. The sun was shining directly upon the
window-blind, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) first glance thitherward a sharp pain obliged
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to close his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) eyelids quickly. At every new attempt to look about
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) the same morbid sensibility to light was manifested, and excoriating
tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) cheeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was obliged to tie a bandage over his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) brow
while dressing; and during the day it could not be abandoned. Eustacia
was thoroughly alarmed. On finding that the case was no better the next
morning they decided to send to Anglebury for a surgeon.

<p/>Towards evening he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) arrived, and pronounced the disease to be acute
inflammation induced by Clym's night studies, continued in spite of a
cold previously caught, which had weakened his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) eyes for the time.

<p/>Fretting with impatience at this interruption to a task he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was so
anxious to hasten, Clym was transformed into an invalid. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was shut
up in a room from which all light was excluded, and his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) condition would
have been one of absolute misery had not Eustacia read to him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) by the
glimmer of a shaded lamp. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hoped that the worst would soon be over;
but at the surgeon's third visit he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) learnt to his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) dismay that although
he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) might venture out of doors with shaded eyes in the course of a
month, all thought of pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) work, or of reading print of any
description, would have to be given up for a long time to come.

<p/>One week and another week wore on, and nothing seemed to lighten the
gloom of the young couple. Dreadful imaginings occurred to Eustacia, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) carefully refrained from uttering them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband. Suppose
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should become blind, or, at all events, never recover sufficient
strength of sight to engage in an occupation which would be congenial to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) feelings, and conduce to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) removal from this lonely dwelling among
the hills? That dream of beautiful Paris was not likely to cohere into
substance in the presence of this misfortune. As day after day passed
by, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got no better, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind ran more and more in this mournful
groove, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would go away from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) into the garden and weep
despairing tears.

<p/>Yeobright thought he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would send for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
would not. Knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) state could only make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the more unhappy;
and the seclusion of their life was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would hardly be likely
to learn the news except through a special messenger. Endeavouring to
take the trouble as philosophically as possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) waited on till the
third week had arrived, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went into the open air for the first
time since the attack. The surgeon visited him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) again at this stage, and
Clym urged him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) to express a distinct opinion. The young man learnt with
added surprise that the date at which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might expect to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
labours was as uncertain as ever, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes being in that peculiar state
which, though affording him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight enough for walking about, would not
admit of their being strained upon any definite object without incurring
the risk of reproducing ophthalmia in its acute form.

<p/>Clym was very grave at the intelligence, but not despairing. A quiet
firmness, and even cheerfulness, took possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
to be blind; that was enough. To be doomed to behold the world through
smoked glass for an indefinite period was bad enough, and fatal to any
kind of advance; but Yeobright was an absolute stoic in the face
of mishaps which only affected his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) social standing; and, apart from
Eustacia, the humblest walk of life would satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if it could be
made to work in with some form of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) culture scheme. To keep a cottage
night-school was one such form; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affliction did not master his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
spirit as it might otherwise have done.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked through the warm sun westward into those tracts of Egdon with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was best acquainted, being those lying nearer to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old home.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in one of the valleys the gleaming of whetted iron,
and advancing, dimly perceived that the shine came from the tool of a
man who was cutting furze. The worker recognized Clym, and Yeobright
learnt from the voice that the speaker was Humphrey.

<p/>Humphrey expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) sorrow at Clym's condition, and added, <div class="bookquote">``Now, if
yours was low-class work like mine, you could go on with it just the
same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright musingly. <div class="bookquote">``How much do you get for
cutting these faggots?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half-a-crown a hundred, and in these long days I can live very well on
the wages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>During the whole of Yeobright's walk home to Alderworth he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was lost in
reflections which were not of an unpleasant kind. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) coming up to
the house Eustacia spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) from the open window, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) went across
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am much happier. And if my mother were reconciled
to me and to you I should, I think, be happy quite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear that will never be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, looking afar with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) beautiful
stormy eyes. <div class="bookquote">``How CAN you say `I am happier,' and nothing changed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It arises from my having at last discovered something I can do, and get
a living at, in this time of misfortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to be a furze- and turf-cutter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Clym!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, the slight hopefulness previously apparent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
face going off again, and leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) worse than before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely I shall. Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the
little money we've got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest
occupation? The outdoor exercise will do me good, and who knows but that
in a few months I shall be able to go on with my reading again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my grandfather offers to assist us, if we require assistance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't require it. If I go furze-cutting we shall be fairly well
off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In comparison with slaves, and the Israelites in Egypt, and such
people!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>A bitter tear rolled down Eustacia's face, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) did not
see. There had been nonchalance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) tone, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) felt no
absolute grief at a consummation which to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was a positive horror.

<p/>The very next day Yeobright went to Humphrey's cottage, and borrowed of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) leggings, gloves, a whetstone, and a hook, to use till he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) should be
able to purchase some for himself. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) sallied forth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) new
fellow-labourer and old acquaintance, and selecting a spot where the
furze grew thickest he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) struck the first blow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) adopted calling. His (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)
sight, like the wings in Rasselas, though useless to him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) grand
purpose, sufficed for this strait, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) found that when a little
practice should have hardened his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) palms against blistering he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) would be
able to work with ease.

<p/>Day after day he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) rose with the sun, buckled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) leggings, and went
off to the rendezvous with Humphrey. His (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) custom was to work from four
o’clock in the morning till noon; then, when the heat of the day was at
its highest, to go home and sleep for an hour or two; afterwards coming
out again and working till dusk at nine.

<p/>This man from Paris was now so disguised by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leather accoutrements,
and by the goggles he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obliged to wear over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
closest friend might have passed by without recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a
brown spot in the midst of an expanse of olive-green gorse, and nothing
more. Though frequently depressed in spirit when not actually at work,
owing to thoughts of Eustacia's position and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's estrangement,
when in the full swing of labour he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was cheerfully disposed and calm.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daily life was of a curious microscopic sort, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole world being
limited to a circuit of a few feet from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) person. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) familiars were
creeping and winged things, and they seemed to enroll him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in their band.
Bees hummed around his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears with an intimate air, and tugged at the
heath and furze-flowers at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side in such numbers as to weigh them
down to the sod. The strange amber-coloured butterflies which Egdon
produced, and which were never seen elsewhere, quivered in the breath of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) lips, alighted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) bowed back, and sported with the
glittering point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) hook as he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) flourished it up and down. Tribes of
emerald-green grasshoppers leaped over his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) feet, falling awkwardly on
their backs, heads, or hips, like unskilful acrobats, as chance might
rule; or engaged themselves in noisy flirtations under the fern-fronds
with silent ones of homely hue. Huge flies, ignorant of larders and
wire-netting, and quite in a savage state, buzzed about him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) without
knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) was a man. In and out of the fern-dells snakes glided
in their most brilliant blue and yellow guise, it being the season
immediately following the shedding of their old skins, when their
colours are brightest. Litters of young rabbits came out from their
forms to sun themselves upon hillocks, the hot beams blazing through the
delicate tissue of each thin-fleshed ear, and firing it to a blood-red
transparency in which the veins could be seen. None of them feared
him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>).

<p/>The monotony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) occupation soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>), and was in itself
a pleasure. A forced limitation of effort offered a justification of
homely courses to an unambitious man, whose conscience would hardly have
allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to remain in such obscurity while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) powers were unimpeded.
Hence Yeobright sometimes sang to himself, and when obliged to accompany
Humphrey in search of brambles for faggot-bonds he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) would amuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)
companion with sketches of Parisian life and character, and so while
away the time.

<p/>On one of these warm afternoons Eustacia walked out alone in the
direction of Yeobright's place of work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) was busily chopping away
at the furze, a long row of faggots which stretched downward from his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)
position representing the labour of the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) did not observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
approach, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stood close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>), and heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) undercurrent of
song. It shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) there, a poor afflicted man, earning
money by the sweat of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brow, had at first moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to tears; but to
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sing and not at all rebel against an occupation which, however
satisfactory to himself, was degrading to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), as an educated lady-
wife, wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) through. Unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) presence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still went
on singing:--

<p/>``Le point du jour
A nos bosquets rend toute leur parure;
Flore est plus belle a son retour;
L’oiseau reprend doux chant d’amour;
Tout celebre dans la nature
Le point du jour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Le point du jour
Cause parfois, cause douleur extreme;
Que l’espace des nuits est court
Pour le berger brulant d’amour,
Force de quitter ce qu’il aime
Au point du jour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>It was bitterly plain to Eustacia that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not care much about
social failure; and the proud fair woman bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and wept in sick
despair at thought of the blasting effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own life of that mood
and condition in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would starve rather than do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``And you
can sing! I will go and live with my grandfather again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eustacia! I did not see you, though I noticed something moving,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said gently. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came forward, pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) huge leather glove, and
took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you speak in such a strange way? It is only a
little old song which struck my fancy when I was in Paris, and now
just applies to my life with you. Has your love for me all died, then,
because my appearance is no longer that of a fine gentleman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest, you must not question me unpleasantly, or it may make me not
love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe it possible that I would run the risk of doing that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you follow out your own ideas, and won't give in to mine when
I wish you to leave off this shameful labour. Is there anything you
dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes? I am your wife,
and why will you not listen? Yes, I am your wife indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what that tone means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What tone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``The tone in which you said, `Your wife indeed.' It meant, `Your wife,
worse luck.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hard in you to probe me with that remark. A woman may have
reason, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not without heart, and if I felt `worse luck,' it
was no ignoble feeling--it was only too natural. There, you see that at
any rate I do not attempt untruths. Do you remember how, before we were
married, I warned you that I had not good wifely qualities?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mock me to say that now. On that point at least the only noble
course would be to hold your tongue, for you are still queen of me,
Eustacia, though I may no longer be king of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are my husband. Does not that content you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not unless you are my wife without regret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot answer you. I remember saying that I should be a serious
matter on your hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I saw that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you were too quick to see! No true lover would have seen any such
thing; you are too severe upon me, Clym--I won't like your speaking so
at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I married you in spite of it, and don't regret doing so. How
cold you seem this afternoon! and yet I used to think there never was a
warmer heart than yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I fear we are cooling--I see it as well as you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sighed
mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``And how madly we loved two months ago! You were never tired
of contemplating me, nor I of contemplating you. Who could have thought
then that by this time my eyes would not seem so very bright to yours,
nor your lips so very sweet to mine? Two months--is it possible? Yes,
`tis too true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You sigh, dear, as if you were sorry for it; and that's a hopeful
sign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I don't sigh for that. There are other things for me to sigh for,
or any other woman in my place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That your chances in life are ruined by marrying in haste an
unfortunate man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why will you force me, Clym, to say bitter things? I deserve pity as
much as you. As much?--I think I deserve it more. For you can sing! It
would be a strange hour which should catch me singing under such a cloud
as this! Believe me, sweet, I could weep to a degree that would astonish
and confound such an elastic mind as yours. Even had you felt careless
about your own affliction, you might have refrained from singing out
of sheer pity for mine. God! if I were a man in such a position I would
curse rather than sing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright placed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``Now, don't you suppose, my
inexperienced girl, that I cannot rebel, in high Promethean fashion,
against the gods and fate as well as you. I have felt more steam and
smoke of that sort than you have ever heard of. But the more I see of
life the more do I perceive that there is nothing particularly great in
its greatest walks, and therefore nothing particularly small in mine of
furze-cutting. If I feel that the greatest blessings vouchsafed to us
are not very valuable, how can I feel it to be any great hardship when
they are taken away? So I sing to pass the time. Have you indeed lost
all tenderness for me, that you begrudge me a few cheerful moments?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have still some tenderness left for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your words have no longer their old flavour. And so love dies with good

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot listen to this, Clym--it will end bitterly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said in a

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>3--She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Goes Out to Battle against Depression


<p/>A few days later, before the month of August has expired, Eustacia and
Yeobright sat together at their early dinner.

<p/>Eustacia's manner had become of late almost apathetic. There was a
forlorn look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) beautiful eyes which, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) deserved it or
not, would have excited pity in the breast of anyone who had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
during the full flush of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) love for Clym. The feelings of husband and
wife varied, in some measure, inversely with their positions. Clym, the
afflicted man, was cheerful; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even tried to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), who had
never felt a moment of physical suffering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) whole life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, brighten up, dearest; we shall be all right again. Some day
perhaps I shall see as well as ever. And I solemnly promise that I'll
leave off cutting furze as soon as I have the power to do anything
better. You cannot seriously wish me to stay idling at home all day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is so dreadful--a furze-cutter! and you a man who have lived
about the world, and speak French, and German, and who are fit for what
is so much better than this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose when you first saw me and heard about me I was wrapped in a
sort of golden halo to your eyes--a man who knew glorious things,
and had mixed in brilliant scenes--in short, an adorable, delightful,
distracting hero?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I am a poor fellow in brown leather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't taunt me. But enough of this. I will not be depressed any more.
I am going from home this afternoon, unless you greatly object. There is
to be a village picnic--a gipsying, they call it--at East Egdon, and I
shall go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To dance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? You can sing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, as you will. Must I come to fetch you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you return soon enough from your work. But do not inconvenience
yourself about it. I know the way home, and the heath has no terror for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And can you cling to gaiety so eagerly as to walk all the way to a
village festival in search of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you don't like my going alone! Clym, you are not jealous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But I would come with you if it could give you any pleasure;
though, as things stand, perhaps you have too much of me already. Still,
I somehow wish that you did not want to go. Yes, perhaps I am jealous;
and who could be jealous with more reason than I, a half-blind man, over
such a woman as you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think like it. Let me go, and don't take all my spirits away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather lose all my own, my sweet wife. Go and do whatever you
like. Who can forbid your indulgence in any whim? You have all my heart
yet, I believe; and because you bear with me, who am in truth a drag
upon you, I owe you thanks. Yes, go alone and shine. As for me, I will
stick to my doom. At that kind of meeting people would shun me. My hook
and gloves are like the St. Lazarus rattle of the leper, warning the
world to get out of the way of a sight that would sadden them.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), put on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leggings, and went out.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hands and said to herself,
<div class="bookquote">``Two wasted lives--his (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) and mine. And I am come to this! Will it drive me
out of my mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cast about for any possible course which offered the least
improvement on the existing state of things, and could find none. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
imagined how all those Budmouth ones who should learn what had become
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``Look at the girl for whom nobody was good enough!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>To Eustacia the situation seemed such a mockery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hopes that death
appeared the only door of relief if the satire of Heaven should go much
further.

<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) aroused herself and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``But I'll shake it off. Yes,
I WILL shake it off! No one shall know my suffering. I'll be bitterly
merry, and ironically gay, and I'll laugh in derision. And I'll begin by
going to this dance on the green.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) ascended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bedroom and dressed herself with scrupulous care.
To an onlooker her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) beauty would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) feelings almost
seem reasonable. The gloomy corner into which accident as much as
indiscretion had brought this woman might have led even a moderate
partisan to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had cogent reasons for asking the Supreme
Power by what right a being of such exquisite finish had been placed
in circumstances calculated to make of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) charms a curse rather than a
blessing.

<p/>It was five in the afternoon when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came out from the house ready
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walk. There was material enough in the picture for twenty new
conquests. The rebellious sadness that was rather too apparent when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
sat indoors without a bonnet was cloaked and softened by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) outdoor
attire, which always had a sort of nebulousness about it, devoid of
harsh edges anywhere; so that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face looked from its environment as
from a cloud, with no noticeable lines of demarcation between flesh and
clothes. The heat of the day had scarcely declined as yet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went
along the sunny hills at a leisurely pace, there being ample time for
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) idle expedition. Tall ferns buried her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in their leafage whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
path lay through them, which now formed miniature forests, though not
one stem of them would remain to bud the next year.

<p/>The site chosen for the village festivity was one of the lawnlike oases
which were occasionally, yet not often, met with on the plateaux of the
heath district. The brakes of furze and fern terminated abruptly round
the margin, and the grass was unbroken. A green cattletrack skirted the
spot, without, however, emerging from the screen of fern, and this path
Eustacia followed, in order to reconnoitre the group before joining it.
The lusty notes of the East Egdon band had directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) unerringly, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) now beheld the musicians themselves, sitting in a blue wagon with
red wheels scrubbed as bright as new, and arched with sticks, to which
boughs and flowers were tied. In front of this was the grand central
dance of fifteen or twenty couples, flanked by minor dances of inferior
individuals whose gyrations were not always in strict keeping with the
tune.

<p/>The young men wore blue and white rosettes, and with a flush on their
faces footed it to the girls, who, with the excitement and the exercise,
blushed deeper than the pink of their numerous ribbons. Fair ones with
long curls, fair ones with short curls, fair ones with lovelocks, fair
ones with braids, flew round and round; and a beholder might well have
wondered how such a prepossessing set of young women of like size, age,
and disposition, could have been collected together where there were
only one or two villages to choose from. In the background was one happy
man dancing by himself, with closed eyes, totally oblivious of all the
rest. A fire was burning under a pollard thorn a few paces off, over
which three kettles hung in a row. Hard by was a table where elderly
dames prepared tea, but Eustacia looked among them in vain for the
cattle-dealer's wife who had suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) should come, and had
promised to obtain a courteous welcome for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>This unexpected absence of the only local resident whom Eustacia knew
considerably damaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) scheme for an afternoon of reckless gaiety.
Joining in became a matter of difficulty, notwithstanding that, were she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
to advance, cheerful dames would come forward with cups of tea and make
much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) as a stranger of superior grace and knowledge to themselves.
Having watched the company through the figures of two dances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
decided to walk a little further, to a cottage where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) might get some
refreshment, and then return homeward in the shady time of evening.

<p/>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did, and by the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) retraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) steps towards the
scene of the gipsying, which it was necessary to repass on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) way to
Alderworth, the sun was going down. The air was now so still that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
could hear the band afar off, and it seemed to be playing with more
spirit, if that were possible, than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had come away. On reaching
the hill the sun had quite disappeared; but this made little difference
either to Eustacia or to the revellers, for a round yellow moon was
rising before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), though its rays had not yet outmastered those from
the west. The dance was going on just the same, but strangers had
arrived and formed a ring around the figure, so that Eustacia could
stand among these without a chance of being recognized.

<p/>A whole village-full of sensuous emotion, scattered abroad all the year
long, surged here in a focus for an hour. The forty hearts of those
waving couples were beating as they had not done since, twelve months
before, they had come together in similar jollity. For the time paganism
was revived in their hearts, the pride of life was all in all, and they
adored none other than themselves.

<p/>How many of those impassioned but temporary embraces were destined to
become perpetual was possibly the wonder of some of those who indulged
in them, as well as of Eustacia who looked on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) began to envy those
pirouetters, to hunger for the hope and happiness which the fascination
of the dance seemed to engender within them. Desperately fond of
dancing herself, one of Eustacia's expectations of Paris had been the
opportunity it might afford her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) of indulgence in this favourite pastime.
Unhappily, that expectation was now extinct within her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) for ever.

<p/>Whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) abstractedly watched them spinning and fluctuating in the
increasing moonlight she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) suddenly heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) name whispered by a voice
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) shoulder. Turning in surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) beheld at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) elbow one
whose presence instantly caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to flush to the temples.

<p/>It was Wildeve. Till this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had not met her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eye since the
morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) marriage, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had been loitering in the church,
and had startled him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) by lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) veil and coming forward to sign the
register as witness. Yet why the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) should have instigated
that sudden rush of blood she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could not tell.

<p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could speak he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Do you like dancing as much as
ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you dance with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a great change for me; but will it not seem strange?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What strangeness can there be in relations dancing together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--yes, relations. Perhaps none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, if you don't like to be seen, pull down your veil; though there
is not much risk of being known by this light. Lots of strangers are
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did as he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) suggested; and the act was a tacit acknowledgment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) offer.

<p/>Wildeve gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) arm and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) down on the outside of the ring
to the bottom of the dance, which they entered. In two minutes more they
were involved in the figure and began working their way upwards to the
top. Till they had advanced halfway thither Eustacia wished more than
once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had not yielded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) request; from the middle to the
top she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) felt that, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had come out to seek pleasure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was only
doing a natural thing to obtain it. Fairly launched into the ceaseless
glides and whirls which their new position as top couple opened up to
them, Eustacia's pulses began to move too quickly for long rumination of
any kind.

<p/>Through the length of five-and-twenty couples they threaded their giddy
way, and a new vitality entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) form. The pale ray of evening lent
a fascination to the experience. There is a certain degree and tone
of light which tends to disturb the equilibrium of the senses, and to
promote dangerously the tenderer moods; added to movement, it drives
the emotions to rankness, the reason becoming sleepy and unperceiving in
inverse proportion; and this light fell now upon these two from the disc
of the moon. All the dancing girls felt the symptoms, but Eustacia most
of all. The grass under their feet became trodden away, and the hard,
beaten surface of the sod, when viewed aslant towards the moonlight,
shone like a polished table. The air became quite still, the flag above
the wagon which held the musicians clung to the pole, and the players
appeared only in outline against the sky; except when the circular
mouths of the trombone, ophicleide, and French horn gleamed out like
huge eyes from the shade of their figures. The pretty dresses of the
maids lost their subtler day colours and showed more or less of a misty
white. Eustacia floated round and round on Wildeve's arm, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face
rapt and statuesque; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) soul had passed away from and forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
features, which were left empty and quiescent, as they always are when
feeling goes beyond their register.

<p/>How near she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was to Wildeve! it was terrible to think of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could feel
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) breathing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), of course, could feel hers. How badly she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had
treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)! yet, here they were treading one measure. The enchantment
of the dance surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). A clear line of difference divided like
a tangible fence her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) experience within this maze of motion from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
experience without it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) beginning to dance had been like a change
of atmosphere; outside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had been steeped in arctic frigidity by
comparison with the tropical sensations here. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had entered the dance
from the troubled hours of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) late life as one might enter a brilliant
chamber after a night walk in a wood. Wildeve by himself would have been
merely an agitation; Wildeve added to the dance, and the moonlight, and
the secrecy, began to be a delight. Whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) personality supplied the
greater part of this sweetly compounded feeling, or whether the dance
and the scene weighed the more therein, was a nice point upon which
Eustacia herself was entirely in a cloud.

<p/>People began to say <div class="bookquote">``Who are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>but no invidious inquiries were
made. Had Eustacia mingled with the other girls in their ordinary
daily walks the case would have been different: here she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was not
inconvenienced by excessive inspection, for all were wrought to their
brightest grace by the occasion. Like the planet Mercury surrounded
by the lustre of sunset, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) permanent brilliancy passed without much
notice in the temporary glory of the situation.

<p/>As for Wildeve, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) feelings are easy to guess. Obstacles were a
ripening sun to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) love, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was at this moment in a delirium of
exquisite misery. To clasp as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) for five minutes what was another
man's through all the rest of the year was a kind of thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) of all men
could appreciate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had long since begun to sigh again for Eustacia;
indeed, it may be asserted that signing the marriage register with
Thomasin was the natural signal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) heart to return to its first
quarters, and that the extra complication of Eustacia's marriage was the
one addition required to make that return compulsory.

<p/>Thus, for different reasons, what was to the rest an exhilarating
movement was to these two a riding upon the whirlwind. The dance had
come like an irresistible attack upon whatever sense of social order
there was in their minds, to drive them back into old paths which were
now doubly irregular. Through three dances in succession they spun their
way; and then, fatigued with the incessant motion, Eustacia turned to
quit the circle in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had already remained too long. Wildeve
led her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to a grassy mound a few yards distant, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sat down, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
partner standing beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). From the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) at the
beginning of the dance till now they had not exchanged a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dance and the walking have tired you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not greatly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is strange that we should have met here of all places, after missing
each other so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have missed because we tried to miss, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But you began that proceeding--by breaking a promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is scarcely worth while to talk of that now. We have formed other
ties since then--you no less than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear that your husband is ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is not ill--only incapacitated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--that is what I mean. I sincerely sympathize with you in your
trouble. Fate has treated you cruelly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was silent awhile. <div class="bookquote">``Have you heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has chosen to work as a
furze-cutter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said in a low, mournful voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been mentioned to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>answered Wildeve hesitatingly. <div class="bookquote">``But I
hardly believed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true. What do you think of me as a furze-cutter's wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the same as ever of you, Eustacia. Nothing of that sort can
degrade you--you ennoble the occupation of your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any chance of Mr. Yeobright getting better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) thinks so. I doubt it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was quite surprised to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had taken a cottage. I thought,
in common with other people, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) would have taken you off to a home
in Paris immediately after you had married him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). `What a gay, bright
future she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) has before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)!' I thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) will, I suppose, return there
with you, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) sight gets strong again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not reply he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) more closely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was
almost weeping. Images of a future never to be enjoyed, the revived
sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bitter disappointment, the picture of the neighbour's
suspended ridicule which was raised by Wildeve's words, had been too
much for proud Eustacia's equanimity.

<p/>Wildeve could hardly control his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) own too forward feelings when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) silent perturbation. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) affected not to notice this, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
soon recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) calmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not intend to walk home by yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia. <div class="bookquote">``What could hurt me on this heath, who have
nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By diverging a little I can make my way home the same as yours. I
shall be glad to keep you company as far as Throope Corner.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>Seeing that
Eustacia sat on in hesitation he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you think it unwise to
be seen in the same road with me after the events of last summer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I think no such thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said haughtily. <div class="bookquote">``I shall accept
whose company I choose, for all that may be said by the miserable
inhabitants of Egdon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let us walk on--if you are ready. Our nearest way is towards that
holly bush with the dark shadow that you see down there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia arose, and walked beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) in the direction signified,
brushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) way over the damping heath and fern, and followed by the
strains of the merrymakers, who still kept up the dance. The moon had
now waxed bright and silvery, but the heath was proof against such
illumination, and there was to be observed the striking scene of a dark,
rayless tract of country under an atmosphere charged from its zenith to
its extremities with whitest light. To an eye above them their two
faces would have appeared amid the expanse like two pearls on a table of
ebony.

<p/>On this account the irregularities of the path were not visible, and
Wildeve occasionally stumbled; whilst Eustacia found it necessary
to perform some graceful feats of balancing whenever a small tuft of
heather or root of furze protruded itself through the grass of the
narrow track and entangled her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) feet. At these junctures in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) progress
a hand was invariably stretched forward to steady her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
firmly until smooth ground was again reached, when the hand was again
withdrawn to a respectful distance.

<p/>They performed the journey for the most part in silence, and drew near
to Throope Corner, a few hundred yards from which a short path branched
away to Eustacia's house. By degrees they discerned coming towards them
a pair of human figures, apparently of the male sex.

<p/>When they came a little nearer Eustacia broke the silence by saying,
<div class="bookquote">``One of those men is my husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) promised to come to meet me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the other is my greatest enemy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks like Diggory Venn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an awkward meeting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but such is my fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows
too much about me, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could know more, and so prove to himself
that what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now knows counts for nothing. Well, let it be--you must
deliver me up to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will think twice before you direct me to do that. Here is a man
who has not forgotten an item in our meetings at Rainbarrow--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in
company with your husband. Which of them, seeing us together here, will
believe that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy party was by chance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) whispered gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``Leave me before they come up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) a tender farewell, and plunged across the fern and
furze, Eustacia slowly walking on. In two or three minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
husband and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My journey ends here for tonight, reddleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I turn back with this lady. Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, Mr. Yeobright,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn. <div class="bookquote">``I hope to see you better soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>The moonlight shone directly upon Venn's face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) spoke, and revealed
all its lines to Eustacia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) was looking suspiciously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). That
Venn's keen eye had discerned what Yeobright's feeble vision had not--a
man in the act of withdrawing from Eustacia's side--was within the
limits of the probable.

<p/>If Eustacia had been able to follow the reddleman she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would soon have
found striking confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) thought. No sooner had Clym given her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) off the scene than the reddleman turned back from
the beaten track towards East Egdon, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been strolling
merely to accompany Clym in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walk, Diggory's van being again in the
neighbourhood. Stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long legs, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crossed the pathless
portion of the heath somewhat in the direction which Wildeve had taken.
Only a man accustomed to nocturnal rambles could at this hour have
descended those shaggy slopes with Venn's velocity without falling
headlong into a pit, or snapping off his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) leg by jamming his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) foot into
some rabbit burrow. But Venn went on without much inconvenience to
himself, and the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) scamper was towards the Quiet Woman Inn.
This place he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) reached in about half an hour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) was well aware that
no person who had been near Throope Corner when he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) started could have
got down here before him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>).

<p/>The lonely inn was not yet closed, though scarcely an individual was
there, the business done being chiefly with travellers who passed the
inn on long journeys, and these had now gone on their way. Venn went to
the public room, called for a mug of ale, and inquired of the maid in an
indifferent tone if Mr. Wildeve was at home.

<p/>Thomasin sat in an inner room and heard Venn's voice. When customers
were present she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) seldom showed herself, owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) inherent dislike
for the business; but perceiving that no one else was there tonight she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
came out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) is not at home yet, Diggory,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said pleasantly. <div class="bookquote">``But I expected
him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) sooner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) has been to East Egdon to buy a horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) wear a light wideawake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) at Throope Corner, leading one home,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn drily.
<div class="bookquote">``A beauty, with a white face and a mane as black as night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) will soon
be here, no doubt.''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Rising and looking for a moment at the pure, sweet
face of Thomasin, over which a shadow of sadness had passed since the
time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had last seen her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) ventured to add, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wildeve seems
to be often away at this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>cried Thomasin in what was intended to be a tone of gaiety.
<div class="bookquote">``Husbands will play the truant, you know. I wish you could tell me of
some secret plan that would help me to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) home at my will in the
evenings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will consider if I know of one,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Venn in that same light
tone which meant no lightness. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) bowed in a manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) own
invention and moved to go. Thomasin offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hand; and without a
sigh, though with food for many, the reddleman went out.

<p/>When Wildeve returned, a quarter of an hour later Thomasin said simply,
and in the abashed manner usual with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) now, <div class="bookquote">``Where is the horse,
Damon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I have not bought it, after all. The man asks too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But somebody saw you at Throope Corner leading it home--a beauty, with
a white face and a mane as black as night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``who told you that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Venn the reddleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>The expression of Wildeve's face became curiously condensed. <div class="bookquote">``That is
a mistake--it must have been someone else,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said slowly and testily,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) perceived that Venn's countermoves had begun again.




<p/>4--Rough Coercion Is Employed


<p/>Those words of Thomasin, which seemed so little, but meant so much,
remained in the ears of Diggory Venn: <div class="bookquote">``Help me to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home in the
evenings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>On this occasion Venn had arrived on Egdon Heath only to cross to the
other side--he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had no further connection with the interests of the
Yeobright family, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had a business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) own to attend to. Yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) suddenly began to feel himself drifting into the old track of
manoeuvring on Thomasin's account.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) van and considered. From Thomasin's words and manner
he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had plainly gathered that Wildeve neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>). For whom could
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) neglect her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) if not for Eustacia? Yet it was scarcely credible
that things had come to such a head as to indicate that Eustacia
systematically encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). Venn resolved to reconnoitre somewhat
carefully the lonely road which led along the vale from Wildeve's
dwelling to Clym's house at Alderworth.

<p/>At this time, as has been seen, Wildeve was quite innocent of any
predetermined act of intrigue, and except at the dance on the green he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
had not once met Eustacia since her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) marriage. But that the spirit of
intrigue was in him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had been shown by a recent romantic habit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)--a
habit of going out after dark and strolling towards Alderworth, there
looking at the moon and stars, looking at Eustacia's house, and walking
back at leisure.

<p/>Accordingly, when watching on the night after the festival, the
reddleman saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) ascend by the little path, lean over the front gate
of Clym's garden, sigh, and turn to go back again. It was plain that
Wildeve's intrigue was rather ideal than real. Venn retreated before him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
down the hill to a place where the path was merely a deep groove
between the heather; here he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) mysteriously bent over the ground for a few
minutes, and retired. When Wildeve came on to that spot his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) ankle was
caught by something, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) fell headlong.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had recovered the power of respiration he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) sat up and
listened. There was not a sound in the gloom beyond the spiritless stir
of the summer wind. Feeling about for the obstacle which had flung
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) discovered that two tufts of heath had been tied together
across the path, forming a loop, which to a traveller was certain
overthrow. Wildeve pulled off the string that bound them, and went on
with tolerable quickness. On reaching home he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) found the cord to be of a
reddish colour. It was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had expected.

<p/>Although his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) weaknesses were not specially those akin to physical fear,
this species of coup-de-Jarnac from one he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) knew too well troubled the
mind of Wildeve. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) movements were unaltered thereby. A night
or two later he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) again went along the vale to Alderworth, taking the
precaution of keeping out of any path. The sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was watched,
that craft was employed to circumvent his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) errant tastes, added piquancy
to a journey so entirely sentimental, so long as the danger was of no
fearful sort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) imagined that Venn and Mrs. Yeobright were in league,
and felt that there was a certain legitimacy in combating such a
coalition.

<p/>The heath tonight appeared to be totally deserted; and Wildeve, after
looking over Eustacia's garden gate for some little time, with a cigar
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mouth, was tempted by the fascination that emotional smuggling
had for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) nature to advance towards the window, which was not quite
closed, the blind being only partly drawn down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) could see into the
room, and Eustacia was sitting there alone. Wildeve contemplated her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
for a minute, and then retreating into the heath beat the ferns lightly,
whereupon moths flew out alarmed. Securing one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) returned to the
window, and holding the moth to the chink, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hand. The moth
made towards the candle upon Eustacia's table, hovered round it two or
three times, and flew into the flame.

<p/>Eustacia started up. This had been a well-known signal in old times when
Wildeve had used to come secretly wooing to Mistover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) at once knew
that Wildeve was outside, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could consider what to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
husband came in from upstairs. Eustacia's face burnt crimson at the
unexpected collision of incidents, and filled it with an animation that
it too frequently lacked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a very high colour, dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) came
close enough to see it. <div class="bookquote">``Your appearance would be no worse if it were
always so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am warm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia. <div class="bookquote">``I think I will go into the air for a few
minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I go with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no. I am only going to the gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) arose, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had time to get out of the room a loud rapping
began upon the front door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go--I'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia in an unusually quick tone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>);
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) glanced eagerly towards the window whence the moth had flown;
but nothing appeared there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better not at this time of the evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said. Clym stepped
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) into the passage, and Eustacia waited, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) somnolent manner
covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) inner heat and agitation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) listened, and Clym opened the door. No words were uttered outside,
and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) closed it and came back, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Nobody was there. I
wonder what that could have meant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was left to wonder during the rest of the evening, for no explanation
offered itself, and Eustacia said nothing, the additional fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
knew of only adding more mystery to the performance.

<p/>Meanwhile a little drama had been acted outside which saved Eustacia
from all possibility of compromising herself that evening at least.
Whilst Wildeve had been preparing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) moth-signal another person had
come behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) up to the gate. This man, who carried a gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand,
looked on for a moment at the other's operation by the window, walked
up to the house, knocked at the door, and then vanished round the corner
and over the hedge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) has been watching me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) signal had been rendered futile by this uproarious rapping
Wildeve withdrew, passed out at the gate, and walked quickly down the
path without thinking of anything except getting away unnoticed. Halfway
down the hill the path ran near a knot of stunted hollies, which in the
general darkness of the scene stood as the pupil in a black eye. When
Wildeve reached this point a report startled his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) ear, and a few spent
gunshots fell among the leaves around him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/>There was no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) himself was the cause of that gun's
discharge; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) rushed into the clump of hollies, beating the bushes
furiously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) stick; but nobody was there. This attack was a
more serious matter than the last, and it was some time before Wildeve
recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) equanimity. A new and most unpleasant system of menace
had begun, and the intent appeared to be to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) grievous bodily harm.
Wildeve had looked upon Venn's first attempt as a species of horseplay,
which the reddleman had indulged in for want of knowing better; but
now the boundary line was passed which divides the annoying from the
perilous.

<p/>Had Wildeve known how thoroughly in earnest Venn had become he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) might
have been still more alarmed. The reddleman had been almost exasperated
by the sight of Wildeve outside Clym's house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was prepared to go
to any lengths short of absolutely shooting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), to terrify the young
innkeeper out of his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) recalcitrant impulses. The doubtful legitimacy of
such rough coercion did not disturb the mind of Venn. It troubles few
such minds in such cases, and sometimes this is not to be regretted.
From the impeachment of Strafford to Farmer Lynch's short way with the
scamps of Virginia there have been many triumphs of justice which are
mockeries of law.

<p/>About half a mile below Clym's secluded dwelling lay a hamlet where
lived one of the two constables who preserved the peace in the parish of
Alderworth, and Wildeve went straight to the constable's cottage. Almost
the first thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) saw on opening the door was the constable's
truncheon hanging to a nail, as if to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) that here were the
means to his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) purpose. On inquiry, however, of the constable's wife he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>)
learnt that the constable was not at home. Wildeve said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would wait.

<p/>The minutes ticked on, and the constable did not arrive. Wildeve cooled
down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) state of high indignation to a restless dissatisfaction
with himself, the scene, the constable's wife, and the whole set of
circumstances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) arose and left the house. Altogether, the experience
of that evening had had a cooling, not to say a chilling, effect on
misdirected tenderness, and Wildeve was in no mood to ramble again to
Alderworth after nightfall in hope of a stray glance from Eustacia.

<p/>Thus far the reddleman had been tolerably successful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) rude
contrivances for keeping down Wildeve's inclination to rove in the
evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had nipped in the bud the possible meeting between Eustacia
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) old lover this very night. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had not anticipated that the
tendency of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) action would be to divert Wildeve's movement rather than
to stop it. The gambling with the guineas had not conduced to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) a
welcome guest to Clym; but to call upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife's relative was natural,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was determined to see Eustacia. It was necessary to choose some
less untoward hour than ten o’clock at night. <div class="bookquote">``Since it is unsafe to go
in the evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go by day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile Venn had left the heath and gone to call upon Mrs. Yeobright,
with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had been on friendly terms since she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had learnt what a
providential countermove he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had made towards the restitution of the
family guineas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) wondered at the lateness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) call, but had no
objection to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) a full account of Clym's affliction, and of the state in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was living; then, referring to Thomasin, touched gently upon
the apparent sadness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) days. <div class="bookquote">``Now, ma’am, depend upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``you couldn't do a better thing for either of `em than to make yourself
at home in their houses, even if there should be a little rebuff at
first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both she (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) and my son disobeyed me in marrying; therefore I have no
interest in their households. Their troubles are of their own making.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Yeobright tried to speak severely; but the account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son's
state had moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) cared to show.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your visits would make Wildeve walk straighter than he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is inclined to
do, and might prevent unhappiness down the heath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw something tonight out there which I didn't like at all. I wish
your son's house and Mr. Wildeve's were a hundred miles apart instead of
four or five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there WAS an understanding between him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) and Clym's wife when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
made a fool of Thomasin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll hope there's no understanding now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And our hope will probably be very vain. O Clym! O Thomasin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no harm done yet. In fact, I've persuaded Wildeve to mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
own business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, not by talking--by a plan of mine called the silent system.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll succeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall if you help me by calling and making friends with your son.
You'll have a chance then of using your eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, since it has come to this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeobright sadly, <div class="bookquote">``I will
own to you, reddleman, that I thought of going. I should be much happier
if we were reconciled. The marriage is unalterable, my life may be cut
short, and I should wish to die in peace. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is my only son; and since
sons are made of such stuff I am not sorry I have no other. As for
Thomasin, I never expected much from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has not disappointed
me. But I forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) long ago; and I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) now. I'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>At this very time of the reddleman's conversation with Mrs. Yeobright
at Blooms-End another conversation on the same subject was languidly
proceeding at Alderworth.

<p/>All the day Clym had borne himself as if his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mind were too full of its
own matter to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to care about outward things, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) words now
showed what had occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) thoughts. It was just after the mysterious
knocking that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) began the theme. <div class="bookquote">``Since I have been away today,
Eustacia, I have considered that something must be done to heal up this
ghastly breach between my dear mother and myself. It troubles me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you propose to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia abstractedly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could
not clear away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) the excitement caused by Wildeve's recent
manoeuvre for an interview.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to take a very mild interest in what I propose, little or
much,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym, with tolerable warmth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mistake me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) answered, reviving at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) reproach. <div class="bookquote">``I am only
thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly of that moth whose skeleton is getting burnt up in the wick of
the candle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``But you know I always take an interest in
what you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, dear. Then I think I must go and call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>...He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) went
on with tender feeling: <div class="bookquote">``It is a thing I am not at all too proud to do,
and only a fear that I might irritate her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has kept me away so long. But
I must do something. It is wrong in me to allow this sort of thing to go
on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you to blame yourself about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is getting old, and her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) life is lonely, and I am her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) only son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has Thomasin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomasin is not her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) daughter; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) were that would not excuse me.
But this is beside the point. I have made up my mind to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and
all I wish to ask you is whether you will do your best to help me--that
is, forget the past; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shows her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) willingness to be reconciled,
meet her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) halfway by welcoming her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to our house, or by accepting a
welcome to hers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>At first Eustacia closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lips as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would rather do anything
on the whole globe than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) suggested. But the lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mouth
softened with thought, though not so far as they might have softened,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will put nothing in your way; but after what has passed
it is asking too much that I go and make advances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never distinctly told me what did pass between you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not do it then, nor can I now. Sometimes more bitterness is
sown in five minutes than can be got rid of in a whole life; and that
may be the case here.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) paused a few moments, and added, <div class="bookquote">``If you had
never returned to your native place, Clym, what a blessing it would have
been for you!... It has altered the destinies of--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>Eustacia thought; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) kept that in.




<p/>5--The Journey across the Heath


<p/>Thursday, the thirty-first of August, was one of a series of days during
which snug houses were stifling, and when cool draughts were treats;
when cracks appeared in clayey gardens, and were called <div class="bookquote">``earthquakes''  (<font color='red'><b>Heath</b></font>)</div>by
apprehensive children; when loose spokes were discovered in the wheels
of carts and carriages; and when stinging insects haunted the air, the
earth, and every drop of water that was to be found.

<p/>In Mrs. Yeobright's garden large-leaved plants of a tender kind flagged
by ten o’clock in the morning; rhubarb bent downward at eleven; and even
stiff cabbages were limp by noon.

<p/>It was about eleven o’clock on this day that Mrs. Yeobright started
across the heath towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son's house, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) best in getting
reconciled with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and Eustacia, in conformity with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) words to the
reddleman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had hoped to be well advanced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) walk before the heat
of the day was at its highest, but after setting out she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) found that this
was not to be done. The sun had branded the whole heath with its mark,
even the purple heath-flowers having put on a brownness under the dry
blazes of the few preceding days. Every valley was filled with air like
that of a kiln, and the clean quartz sand of the winter water-courses,
which formed summer paths, had undergone a species of incineration since
the drought had set in.

<p/>In cool, fresh weather Mrs. Yeobright would have found no inconvenience
in walking to Alderworth, but the present torrid attack made the journey
a heavy undertaking for a woman past middle age; and at the end of the
third mile she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had hired Fairway to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a portion
at least of the distance. But from the point at which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had arrived it
was as easy to reach Clym's house as to get home again. So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on,
the air around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pulsating silently, and oppressing the earth with
lassitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at the sky overhead, and saw that the sapphirine
hue of the zenith in spring and early summer had been replaced by a
metallic violet.

<p/>Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to a spot where independent worlds of ephemerons
were passing their time in mad carousal, some in the air, some on the
hot ground and vegetation, some in the tepid and stringy water of a
nearly dried pool. All the shallower ponds had decreased to a vaporous
mud amid which the maggoty shapes of innumerable obscure creatures could
be indistinctly seen, heaving and wallowing with enjoyment. Being a
woman not disinclined to philosophize she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sometimes sat down under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
umbrella to rest and to watch their happiness, for a certain hopefulness
as to the result of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visit gave ease to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind, and between
important thoughts left it free to dwell on any infinitesimal matter
which caught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Mrs. Yeobright had never before been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son's house, and its exact
position was unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) tried one ascending path and another,
and found that they led her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) astray. Retracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) steps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) came again
to an open level, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) perceived at a distance a man at work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
went towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and inquired the way.

<p/>The labourer pointed out the direction, and added, <div class="bookquote">``Do you see that
furze-cutter, ma’am, going up that footpath yond?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The labourer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes, and at last said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) did perceive
him (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you follow him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) you can make no mistake. He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s going to the same
place, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) followed the figure indicated. He (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) appeared of a russet hue, not more
distinguishable from the scene around him (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) than the green caterpillar
from the leaf it feeds on. His (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) progress when actually walking was more
rapid than Mrs. Yeobright's; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was enabled to keep at an equable
distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) habit of stopping whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) came to a brake
of brambles, where he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) paused awhile. On coming in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) turn to each of
these spots she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) found half a dozen long limp brambles which he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) had cut
from the bush during his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) halt and laid out straight beside the path.
They were evidently intended for furze-faggot bonds which he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) meant to
collect on his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) return.

<p/>The silent being who thus occupied himself seemed to be of no more
account in life than an insect. He (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) appeared as a mere parasite of
the heath, fretting its surface in his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) daily labour as a moth frets a
garment, entirely engrossed with its products, having no knowledge of
anything in the world but fern, furze, heath, lichens, and moss.

<p/>The furze-cutter was so absorbed in the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) journey that he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>)
never turned his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) head; and his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) leather-legged and gauntleted form at
length became to her (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) as nothing more than a moving handpost to show her (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>)
the way. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) was attracted to his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) individuality by observing
peculiarities in his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) walk. It was a gait she (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) had seen somewhere before;
and the gait revealed the man to her (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>), as the gait of Ahimaaz in the
distant plain made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) known to the watchman of the king. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) walk
is exactly as my husband's used to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) said; and then the thought
burst upon her (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) that the furze-cutter was her (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) son.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) was scarcely able to familiarize herself with this strange reality.
She (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) had been told that Clym was in the habit of cutting furze, but she (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>)
had supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) occupied himself with the labour only at odd times,
by way of useful pastime; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) now beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as a furze-cutter and
nothing more--wearing the regulation dress of the craft, and thinking
the regulation thoughts, to judge by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) motions. Planning a dozen hasty
schemes for at once preserving him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and Eustacia from this mode of life,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) throbbingly followed the way, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) enter his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own door.

<p/>At one side of Clym's house was a knoll, and on the top of the knoll a
clump of fir trees so highly thrust up into the sky that their foliage
from a distance appeared as a black spot in the air above the crown
of the hill. On reaching this place Mrs. Yeobright felt distressingly
agitated, weary, and unwell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) ascended, and sat down under their
shade to recover herself, and to consider how best to break the ground
with Eustacia, so as not to irritate a woman underneath whose apparent
indolence lurked passions even stronger and more active than her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own.

<p/>The trees beneath which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sat were singularly battered, rude, and
wild, and for a few minutes Mrs. Yeobright dismissed thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) own
storm-broken and exhausted state to contemplate theirs. Not a bough in
the nine trees which composed the group but was splintered, lopped,
and distorted by the fierce weather that there held them at its mercy
whenever it prevailed. Some were blasted and split as if by lightning,
black stains as from fire marking their sides, while the ground at their
feet was strewn with dead fir-needles and heaps of cones blown down in
the gales of past years. The place was called the Devil's Bellows, and
it was only necessary to come there on a March or November night to
discover the forcible reasons for that name. On the present heated
afternoon, when no perceptible wind was blowing, the trees kept up a
perpetual moan which one could hardly believe to be caused by the air.

<p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sat for twenty minutes or more ere she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) could summon resolution
to go down to the door, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) courage being lowered to zero by her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
physical lassitude. To any other person than a mother it might have
seemed a little humiliating that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), the elder of the two women, should
be the first to make advances. But Mrs. Yeobright had well considered
all that, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) only thought how best to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) visit appear to
Eustacia not abject but wise.

<p/>From her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) elevated position the exhausted woman could perceive the roof
of the house below, and the garden and the whole enclosure of the
little domicile. And now, at the moment of rising, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) saw a second man
approaching the gate. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner was peculiar, hesitating, and not that
of a person come on business or by invitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) surveyed the house
with interest, and then walked round and scanned the outer boundary
of the garden, as one might have done had it been the birthplace of
Shakespeare, the prison of Mary Stuart, or the Chateau of Hougomont.
After passing round and again reaching the gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) went in. Mrs.
Yeobright was vexed at this, having reckoned on finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) son and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
wife by themselves; but a moment's thought showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) that the
presence of an acquaintance would take off the awkwardness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) first
appearance in the house, by confining the talk to general matters until
she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had begun to feel comfortable with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) came down the hill to
the gate, and looked into the hot garden.

<p/>There lay the cat asleep on the bare gravel of the path, as if beds,
rugs, and carpets were unendurable. The leaves of the hollyhocks hung
like half-closed umbrellas, the sap almost simmered in the stems, and
foliage with a smooth surface glared like metallic mirrors. A small
apple tree, of the sort called Ratheripe, grew just inside the gate, the
only one which throve in the garden, by reason of the lightness of
the soil; and among the fallen apples on the ground beneath were wasps
rolling drunk with the juice, or creeping about the little caves in each
fruit which they had eaten out before stupefied by its sweetness. By the
door lay Clym's furze-hook and the last handful of faggot-bonds she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) gather; they had plainly been thrown down there as he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) entered
the house.




<p/>6--A Conjuncture, and Its Result upon the Pedestrian


<p/>Wildeve, as has been stated, was determined to visit Eustacia boldly, by
day, and on the easy terms of a relation, since the reddleman had spied
out and spoilt his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) walks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) by night. The spell that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had thrown
over him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) in the moonlight dance made it impossible for a man having no
strong puritanic force within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to keep away altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) merely
calculated on meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband in an ordinary manner,
chatting a little while, and leaving again. Every outward sign was to be
conventional; but the one great fact would be there to satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not even desire Clym's absence, since it was just
possible that Eustacia might resent any situation which could compromise
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) dignity as a wife, whatever the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) heart towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
Women were often so.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went accordingly; and it happened that the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrival
coincided with that of Mrs. Yeobright's pause on the hill near the
house. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had looked round the premises in the manner she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had
noticed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went and knocked at the door. There was a few minutes'
interval, and then the key turned in the lock, the door opened, and
Eustacia herself confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Nobody could have imagined from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bearing now that here stood the
woman who had joined with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the impassioned dance of the week
before, unless indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have penetrated below the surface and
gauged the real depth of that still stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you reached home safely?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) carelessly returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And were you not tired the next day? I feared you might be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was rather. You need not speak low--nobody will over-hear us. My
small servant is gone on an errand to the village.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Clym is not at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O! I thought that perhaps you had locked the door because you were
alone and were afraid of tramps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--here is my husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had been standing in the entry. Closing the front door and turning
the key, as before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) threw open the door of the adjoining room and
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) to walk in. Wildeve entered, the room appearing to be empty;
but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had advanced a few steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) started. On the hearthrug
lay Clym asleep. Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) were the leggings, thick boots, leather
gloves, and sleeve-waistcoat in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) worked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may go in; you will not disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, following behind.
<div class="bookquote">``My reason for fastening the door is that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may not be intruded upon
by any chance comer while lying here, if I should be in the garden or
upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sleeping there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve in low tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is very weary. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went out at half-past four this morning, and has
been working ever since. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cuts furze because it is the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
can do that does not put any strain upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) poor eyes.''  (<font color='red'><b>the sleeper</b></font>)</div>The contrast
between the sleeper's appearance and Wildeve's at this moment was
painfully apparent to Eustacia, Wildeve being elegantly dressed in a new
summer suit and light hat; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``Ah! you don't know how
differently he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appeared when I first met him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), though it is such a little
while ago. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands were as white and soft as mine; and look at them
now, how rough and brown they are! His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) complexion is by nature fair, and
that rusty look he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has now, all of a colour with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) leather clothes, is
caused by the burning of the sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) go out at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>Wildeve whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hates to be idle; though what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) earns doesn't add much to
our exchequer. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) says that when people are living upon their
capital they must keep down current expenses by turning a penny where
they can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fates have not been kind to you, Eustacia Yeobright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to thank them for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor has he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--except for their one great gift to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in the eyes.

<p/>Eustacia blushed for the first time that day. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I am a questionable
gift,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you meant the gift of content--which
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has, and I have not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can understand content in such a case--though how the outward
situation can attract him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) puzzles me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's because you don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s an enthusiast about ideas, and
careless about outward things. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) often reminds me of the Apostle Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'s so grand in character as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but the worst of it is that though Paul was excellent as a man in
the Bible he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would hardly have done in real life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their voices had instinctively dropped lower, though at first they had
taken no particular care to avoid awakening Clym. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if that means
that your marriage is a misfortune to you, you know who is to blame,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The marriage is no misfortune in itself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) retorted with some little
petulance. <div class="bookquote">``It is simply the accident which has happened since that has
been the cause of my ruin. I have certainly got thistles for figs in a
worldly sense, but how could I tell what time would bring forth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes, Eustacia, I think it is a judgment upon you. You rightly
belonged to me, you know; and I had no idea of losing you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it was not my fault! Two could not belong to you; and remember
that, before I was aware, you turned aside to another woman. It was
cruel levity in you to do that. I never dreamt of playing such a game on
my side till you began it on yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant nothing by it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>replied Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``It was a mere interlude. Men
are given to the trick of having a passing fancy for somebody else in
the midst of a permanent love, which reasserts itself afterwards just as
before. On account of your rebellious manner to me I was tempted to go
further than I should have done; and when you still would keep playing
the same tantalizing part I went further still, and married her (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Turning and looking again at the unconscious form of Clym, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) murmured,
<div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that you don't value your prize, Clym... He (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) ought to be
happier than I in one thing at least. He (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) may know what it is to come
down in the world, and to be afflicted with a great personal calamity;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) probably doesn't know what it is to lose the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) loved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) is not ungrateful for winning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>whispered Eustacia, <div class="bookquote">``and in that
respect he (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) is a good man. Many women would go far for such a husband.
But do I desire unreasonably much in wanting what is called life--music,
poetry, passion, war, and all the beating and pulsing that are going on
in the great arteries of the world? That was the shape of my youthful
dream; but I did not get it. Yet I thought I saw the way to it in my
Clym.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you only married him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on that account?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you mistake me. I married him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) because I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), but I won't
say that I didn't love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) partly because I thought I saw a promise of
that life in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have dropped into your old mournful key.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not going to be depressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cried perversely. <div class="bookquote">``I began a
new system by going to that dance, and I mean to stick to it. Clym can
sing merrily; why should not I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve looked thoughtfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is easier to say you will sing
than to do it; though if I could I would encourage you in your attempt.
But as life means nothing to me, without one thing which is now
impossible, you will forgive me for not being able to encourage you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Damon, what is the matter with you, that you speak like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
asked, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) deep shady eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a thing I shall never tell plainly; and perhaps if I try to tell
you in riddles you will not care to guess them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia remained silent for a minute, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``We are in a
strange relationship today. You mince matters to an uncommon nicety. You
mean, Damon, that you still love me. Well, that gives me sorrow, for I
am not made so entirely happy by my marriage that I am willing to spurn
you for the information, as I ought to do. But we have said too much
about this. Do you mean to wait until my husband is awake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); but it is unnecessary, Eustacia, if I offend
you by not forgetting you, you are right to mention it; but do not talk
of spurning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not reply, and they stood looking musingly at Clym as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) slept
on in that profound sleep which is the result of physical labour carried
on in circumstances that wake no nervous fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God, how I envy him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that sweet sleep!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``I have not slept
like that since I was a boy--years and years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>While they thus watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) a click at the gate was audible, and a knock
came to the door. Eustacia went to a window and looked out.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) countenance changed. First she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) became crimson, and then the red
subsided till it even partially left her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I go away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, standing up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Yeobright. O, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said to me that day! I cannot understand
this visit--what does she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) mean? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) suspects that past time of
ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in your hands. If you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had better not see me here I'll go
into the next room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes--go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve at once withdrew; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had been half a minute in the
adjoining apartment Eustacia came after him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we won't have any of this. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) comes in she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) must see
you--and think if she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) likes there's something wrong! But how can I open
the door to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) dislikes me--wishes to see not me, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
son? I won't open the door!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright knocked again more loudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) knocking will, in all likelihood, awaken him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>continued Eustacia,
<div class="bookquote">``and then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will let her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) in himself. Ah--listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>They could hear Clym moving in the other room, as if disturbed by the
knocking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) uttered the word <div class="bookquote">``Mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is awake--he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will go to the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, with a breath of
relief. <div class="bookquote">``Come this way. I have a bad name with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), and you must not
be seen. Thus I am obliged to act by stealth, not because I do ill, but
because others are pleased to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) to the back door, which was open,
disclosing a path leading down the garden. <div class="bookquote">``Now, one word, Damon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
remarked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) stepped forth. <div class="bookquote">``This is your first visit here; let it
be your last. We have been hot lovers in our time, but it won't do now.
Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``I have had all I came for, and I am
satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sight of you. Upon my eternal honour I came for no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hand to the beautiful girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) addressed, and passed
into the garden, where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) down the path, over the stile at
the end, and into the ferns outside, which brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hips as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) went
along till he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) became lost in their thickets. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had quite gone she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
slowly turned, and directed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attention to the interior of the house.

<p/>But it was possible that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presence might not be desired by Clym and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mother at this moment of their first meeting, or that it would be
superfluous. At all events, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in no hurry to meet Mrs. Yeobright.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) resolved to wait till Clym came to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), and glided back
into the garden. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) idly occupied herself for a few minutes, till
finding no notice was taken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) retraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) steps through the
house to the front, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) listened for voices in the parlour. But
hearing none she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) opened the door and went in. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) astonishment Clym
lay precisely as Wildeve and herself had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) sleep apparently
unbroken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had been disturbed and made to dream and murmur by the
knocking, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had not awakened. Eustacia hastened to the door, and in
spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) reluctance to open it to a woman who had spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
so bitterly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) unfastened it and looked out. Nobody was to be seen.
There, by the scraper, lay Clym's hook and the handful of faggot-bonds
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had brought home; in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) were the empty path, the garden
gate standing slightly ajar; and, beyond, the great valley of purple
heath thrilling silently in the sun. Mrs. Yeobright was gone.


<p/>Clym's mother was at this time following a path which lay hidden from
Eustacia by a shoulder of the hill. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) walk thither from the garden
gate had been hasty and determined, as of a woman who was now no less
anxious to escape from the scene than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had previously been to enter
it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes were fixed on the ground; within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two sights were
graven--that of Clym's hook and brambles at the door, and that of a
woman's face at a window. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips trembled, becoming unnaturally thin
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured, ```Tis too much--Clym, how can he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) bear to do it! He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) is
at home; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) lets her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shut the door against me!''

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anxiety to get out of the direct view of the house she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
diverged from the straightest path homeward, and while looking about
to regain it she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came upon a little boy gathering whortleberries in a
hollow. The boy was Johnny Nunsuch, who had been Eustacia's stoker
at the bonfire, and, with the tendency of a minute body to gravitate
towards a greater, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) began hovering round Mrs. Yeobright as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
appeared, and trotted on beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) without perceptible consciousness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) act.

<p/>Mrs. Yeobright spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) as one in a mesmeric sleep. ```Tis a long way
home, my child, and we shall not get there till evening.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) small companion. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to play marnels afore
supper, and we go to supper at six o’clock, because Father comes home.
Does your father come home at six too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never comes; nor my son either, nor anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have made you so down? Have you seen a ooser?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen what's worse--a woman's face looking at me through a
windowpane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that a bad sight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It is always a bad sight to see a woman looking out at a weary
wayfarer and not letting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once when I went to Throope Great Pond to catch effets I seed myself
looking up at myself, and I was frightened and jumped back like
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>...<div class="bookquote">``If they had only shown signs of meeting my advances halfway how well
it might have been done! But there is no chance. Shut out! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must have
set him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) against me. Can there be beautiful bodies without hearts inside?
I think so. I would not have done it against a neighbour's cat on such a
fiery day as this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never again--never! Not even if they send for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be a very curious woman to talk like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said, returning to the boy's prattle. <div class="bookquote">``Most
people who grow up and have children talk as I do. When you grow up your
mother will talk as I do too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) won't; because `tis very bad to talk nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, child; it is nonsense, I suppose. Are you not nearly spent with
the heat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But not so much as you be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your face is white and wet, and your head is hanging-down-like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I am exhausted from inside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you, every time you take a step, go like this?''  (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>The child in
speaking gave to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) motion the jerk and limp of an invalid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I have a burden which is more than I can bear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The little boy remained silently pondering, and they tottered on side
by side until more than a quarter of an hour had elapsed, when Mrs.
Yeobright, whose weakness plainly increased, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I must sit
down here to rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had seated herself he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked long in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face and said, <div class="bookquote">``How
funny you draw your breath--like a lamb when you drive him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'s
nearly done for. Do you always draw your breath like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) voice was now so low as to be scarcely above a
whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will go to sleep there, I suppose, won't you? You have shut your
eyes already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I shall not sleep much till--another day, and then I hope to have
a long, long one--very long. Now can you tell me if Rimsmoor Pond is dry
this summer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rimsmoor Pond is, but Oker's Pool isn't, because he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) is deep, and is
never dry--`tis just over there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the water clear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, middling--except where the heath-croppers walk into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, take this, and go as fast as you can, and dip me up the clearest
you can find. I am very faint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) drew from the small willow reticule that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) hand an
old-fashioned china teacup without a handle; it was one of half a dozen
of the same sort lying in the reticule, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had preserved ever
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) childhood, and had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) today as a small present
for Clym and Eustacia.

<p/>The boy started on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) errand, and soon came back with the water, such
as it was. Mrs. Yeobright attempted to drink, but it was so warm as to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) nausea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) threw it away. Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) still remained
sitting, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes closed.

<p/>The boy waited, played near her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), caught several of the little brown
butterflies which abounded, and then said as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) waited again, <div class="bookquote">``I like
going on better than biding still. Will you soon start again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I might go on by myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) resumed, fearing, apparently, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was to be pressed into some unpleasant service. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want me any
more, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeobright made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I tell Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) you have seen a broken-hearted woman cast off by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Before quite leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) threw upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face a wistful glance, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had misgivings on the generosity of forsaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) thus. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gazed into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face in a vague, wondering manner, like that of one examining some
strange old manuscript the key to whose characters is undiscoverable. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
was not so young as to be absolutely without a sense that sympathy
was demanded, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was not old enough to be free from the terror felt
in childhood at beholding misery in adult quarters hither-to deemed
impregnable; and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) were in a position to cause trouble or to
suffer from it, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) affliction were something to pity or
something to fear, it was beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to decide. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes
and went on without another word. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had gone half a mile he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had
forgotten all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), except that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was a woman who had sat down to
rest.

<p/>Mrs. Yeobright's exertions, physical and emotional, had well-nigh
prostrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) continued to creep along in short stages with
long breaks between. The sun had now got far to the west of south and
stood directly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face, like some merciless incendiary, brand in
hand, waiting to consume her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>). With the departure of the boy all visible
animation disappeared from the landscape, though the intermittent husky
notes of the male grasshoppers from every tuft of furze were enough to
show that amid the prostration of the larger animal species an unseen
insect world was busy in all the fullness of life.

<p/>In two hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) reached a slope about three-fourths the whole
distance from Alderworth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) own home, where a little patch of
shepherd's-thyme intruded upon the path; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) sat down upon the
perfumed mat it formed there. In front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) a colony of ants
had established a thoroughfare across the way, where they toiled a
never-ending and heavy-laden throng. To look down upon them was like
observing a city street from the top of a tower. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) remembered
that this bustle of ants had been in progress for years at the same
spot--doubtless those of the old times were the ancestors of these which
walked there now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) leant back to obtain more thorough rest, and the
soft eastern portion of the sky was as great a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes as the
thyme was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) head. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) looked a heron arose on that side of
the sky and flew on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) face towards the sun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) had come dripping
wet from some pool in the valleys, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) flew the edges and lining
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) wings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) thighs and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) breast were so caught by the bright
sunbeams that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) appeared as if formed of burnished silver. Up in the
zenith where he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was seemed a free and happy place, away from all contact
with the earthly ball to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was pinioned; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
could arise uncrushed from its surface and fly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) flew then.

<p/>But, being a mother, it was inevitable that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should soon cease to
ruminate upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own condition. Had the track of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) next thought been
marked by a streak in the air, like the path of a meteor, it would have
shown a direction contrary to the heron's, and have descended to the
eastward upon the roof of Clym's house.




<p/>7--The Tragic Meeting of Two Old Friends


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) in the meantime had aroused himself from sleep, sat up, and looked
around. Eustacia was sitting in a chair hard by him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) held
a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had not looked into it for some time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym, brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``How
soundly I have slept! I have had such a tremendous dream, too--one I
shall never forget.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you had been dreaming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It was about my mother. I dreamt that I took you to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house to
make up differences, and when we got there we couldn't get in, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kept on crying to us for help. However, dreams are dreams. What
o’clock is it, Eustacia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half-past two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So late, is it? I didn't mean to stay so long. By the time I have had
something to eat it will be after three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ann is not come back from the village, and I thought I would let you
sleep on till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) returned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym went to the window and looked out. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) said, musingly,
<div class="bookquote">``Week after week passes, and yet Mother does not come. I thought I
should have heard something from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) long before this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Misgiving, regret, fear, resolution, ran their swift course of
expression in Eustacia's dark eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was face to face with
a monstrous difficulty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) resolved to get free of it by
postponement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must certainly go to Blooms-End soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``and I think I
had better go alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) leggings and gloves, threw them
down again, and added, <div class="bookquote">``As dinner will be so late today I will not go
back to the heath, but work in the garden till the evening, and then,
when it will be cooler, I will walk to Blooms-End. I am quite sure that
if I make a little advance Mother will be willing to forget all. It will
be rather late before I can get home, as I shall not be able to do the
distance either way in less than an hour and a half. But you will not
mind for one evening, dear? What are you thinking of to make you look so
abstracted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said heavily. <div class="bookquote">``I wish we didn't live here,
Clym. The world seems all wrong in this place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--if we make it so. I wonder if Thomasin has been to Blooms-End
lately. I hope so. But probably not, as she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is, I believe, expecting to
be confined in a month or so. I wish I had thought of that before. Poor
Mother must indeed be very lonely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like you going tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not tonight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something may be said which will terribly injure me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother is not vindictive,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym, his (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) colour faintly rising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I wish you would not go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>Eustacia repeated in a low tone. <div class="bookquote">``If you
agree not to go tonight I promise to go by myself to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house tomorrow,
and make it up with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and wait till you fetch me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you want to do that at this particular time, when at every
previous time that I have proposed it you have refused?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot explain further than that I should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) alone
before you go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) answered, with an impatient move of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head, and
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) with an anxiety more frequently seen upon those of a
sanguine temperament than upon such as herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is very odd that just when I had decided to go myself you
should want to do what I proposed long ago. If I wait for you to go
tomorrow another day will be lost; and I know I shall be unable to rest
another night without having been. I want to get this settled, and will.
You must visit her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) afterwards--it will be all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could even go with you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could scarcely walk there and back without a longer rest than I
shall take. No, not tonight, Eustacia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it be as you say, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied in the quiet way of one who,
though willing to ward off evil consequences by a mild effort, would let
events fall out as they might sooner than wrestle hard to direct them.

<p/>Clym then went into the garden; and a thoughtful languor stole
over Eustacia for the remainder of the afternoon, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband
attributed to the heat of the weather.

<p/>In the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) set out on the journey. Although the heat of summer
was yet intense the days had considerably shortened, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
advanced a mile on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) way all the heath purples, browns, and greens
had merged in a uniform dress without airiness or graduation, and broken
only by touches of white where the little heaps of clean quartz sand
showed the entrance to a rabbit burrow, or where the white flints of a
footpath lay like a thread over the slopes. In almost every one of
the isolated and stunted thorns which grew here and there a nighthawk
revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence by whirring like the clack of a mill as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
could hold his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breath, then stopping, flapping his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wings, wheeling round
the bush, alighting, and after a silent interval of listening beginning
to whirr again. At each brushing of Clym's feet white millermoths
flew into the air just high enough to catch upon their dusty wings the
mellowed light from the west, which now shone across the depressions and
levels of the ground without falling thereon to light them up.

<p/>Yeobright walked on amid this quiet scene with a hope that all would
soon be well. Three miles on he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came to a spot where a soft perfume was
wafted across his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) path, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stood still for a moment to inhale the
familiar scent. It was the place at which, four hours earlier,
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother had sat down exhausted on the knoll covered with
shepherd's-thyme. While he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stood a sound between a breathing and a moan
suddenly reached his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ears.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked to where the sound came from; but nothing appeared there save
the verge of the hillock stretching against the sky in an unbroken line.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) moved a few steps in that direction, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) perceived a recumbent
figure almost close to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feet.

<p/>Among the different possibilities as to the person's individuality there
did not for a moment occur to Yeobright that it might be one of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own
family. Sometimes furze-cutters had been known to sleep out of doors at
these times, to save a long journey homeward and back again; but
Clym remembered the moan and looked closer, and saw that the form was
feminine; and a distress came over him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) like cold air from a cave. But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
was not absolutely certain that the woman was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stooped
and beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, pallid, and with closed eyes.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breath went, as it were, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) body and the cry of anguish
which would have escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) died upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips. During the momentary
interval that elapsed before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) became conscious that something must be
done all sense of time and place left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother were as when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a child with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) many years ago on this
heath at hours similar to the present. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) awoke to activity; and
bending yet lower he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still breathed, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breath
though feeble was regular, except when disturbed by an occasional gasp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, what is it! Mother, are you very ill--you are not dying?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cried,
pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I am your Clym. How did you come here?
What does it all mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the chasm in their lives which his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love for Eustacia had
caused was not remembered by Yeobright, and to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the present joined
continuously with that friendly past that had been their experience
before the division.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lips, appeared to know him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), but could not speak; and then
Clym strove to consider how best to move her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), as it would be necessary
to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) away from the spot before the dews were intense. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
able-bodied, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother was thin. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a little, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Does that hurt you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up; then, at a slow pace, went
onward with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) load. The air was now completely cool; but whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
passed over a sandy patch of ground uncarpeted with vegetation there was
reflected from its surface into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face the heat which it had imbibed
during the day. At the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) undertaking he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had thought
but little of the distance which yet would have to be traversed before
Blooms-End could be reached; but though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had slept that afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
soon began to feel the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) burden. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) proceeded, like
Aeneas with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father; the bats circling round his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head, nightjars
flapping their wings within a yard of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face, and not a human being
within call.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was yet nearly a mile from the house his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother exhibited signs
of restlessness under the constraint of being borne along, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
arms were irksome to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knees and looked
around. The point they had now reached, though far from any road, was
not more than a mile from the Blooms-End cottages occupied by Fairway,
Sam, Humphrey, and the Cantles. Moreover, fifty yards off stood a hut,
built of clods and covered with thin turves, but now entirely disused.
The simple outline of the lonely shed was visible, and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)
determined to direct his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) steps. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) arrived he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) down
carefully by the entrance, and then ran and cut with his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) pocketknife
an armful of the dryest fern. Spreading this within the shed, which was
entirely open on one side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) mother thereon; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) ran
with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) might towards the dwelling of Fairway.

<p/>Nearly a quarter of an hour had passed, disturbed only by the broken
breathing of the sufferer, when moving figures began to animate the
line between heath and sky. In a few moments Clym arrived with Fairway,
Humphrey, and Susan Nunsuch; Olly Dowden, who had chanced to be at
Fairway's, Christian and Grandfer Cantle following helter-skelter
behind. They had brought a lantern and matches, water, a pillow, and a
few other articles which had occurred to their minds in the hurry of the
moment. Sam had been despatched back again for brandy, and a boy brought
Fairway's pony, upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rode off to the nearest medical man, with
directions to call at Wildeve's on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) way, and inform Thomasin that her (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>)
aunt was unwell.

<p/>Sam and the brandy soon arrived, and it was administered by the light of
the lantern; after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) became sufficiently conscious to signify
by signs that something was wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) foot. Olly Dowden at length
understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) meaning, and examined the foot indicated. It was swollen
and red. Even as they watched the red began to assume a more livid
colour, in the midst of which appeared a scarlet speck, smaller than a
pea, and it was found to consist of a drop of blood, which rose above
the smooth flesh of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) ankle in a hemisphere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>cried Sam. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) has been stung by an adder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym instantly. <div class="bookquote">``I remember when I was a child seeing just
such a bite. O, my poor mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my father who was bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam. <div class="bookquote">``And there's only one way to
cure it. You must rub the place with the fat of other adders, and the
only way to get that is by frying them. That's what they did for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis an old remedy,'' said Clym distrustfully, <div class="bookquote">``and I have doubts about
it. But we can do nothing else till the doctor comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis a sure cure,'' said Olly Dowden, with emphasis. <div class="bookquote">``I've used it when
I used to go out nursing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we must pray for daylight, to catch them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym gloomily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will see what I can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) took a green hazel which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had used as a walking stick, split it at
the end, inserted a small pebble, and with the lantern in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) hand
went out into the heath. Clym had by this time lit a small fire, and
despatched Susan Nunsuch for a frying pan. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) had returned Sam
came in with three adders, one briskly coiling and uncoiling in the
cleft of the stick, and the other two hanging dead across it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only been able to get one alive and fresh as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ought to be,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam. <div class="bookquote">``These limp ones are two I killed today at work; but as they
don't die till the sun goes down they can't be very stale meat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The live adder regarded the assembled group with a sinister look in its
small black eye, and the beautiful brown and jet pattern on its back
seemed to intensify with indignation. Mrs. Yeobright saw the creature,
and the creature saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) quivered throughout, and averted her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>murmured Christian Cantle. <div class="bookquote">``Neighbours, how do we know
but that something of the old serpent in God's garden, that gied the
apple to the young woman with no clothes, lives on in adders and snakes
still? Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eye--for all the world like a villainous sort of
black currant. `Tis to be hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) can't ill-wish us! There's folks in
heath who've been overlooked already. I will never kill another adder as
long as I live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `tis right to be afeard of things, if folks can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said
Grandfer Cantle. ```Twould have saved me many a brave danger in my time.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy I heard something outside the shed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian. <div class="bookquote">``I wish
troubles would come in the daytime, for then a man could show his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
courage, and hardly beg for mercy of the most broomstick old woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
should see, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a brave man, and able to run out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even such an ignorant fellow as I should know better than do that,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's calamities where we least expect it, whether or no.
Neighbours, if Mrs. Yeobright were to die, d’ye think we should be took
up and tried for the manslaughter of a woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they couldn't bring it in as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, <div class="bookquote">``unless they could
prove we had been poachers at some time of our lives. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll fetch
round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, if I had been stung by ten adders I should hardly have lost a
day's work for't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle. <div class="bookquote">``Such is my spirit when I am on
my mettle. But perhaps `tis natural in a man trained for war. Yes, I've
gone through a good deal; but nothing ever came amiss to me after I
joined the Locals in four.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) head and smiled at a mental
picture of himself in uniform. <div class="bookquote">``I was always first in the most
galliantest scrapes in my younger days!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose that was because they always used to put the biggest fool
afore,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Fairway from the fire, beside which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) knelt, blowing it
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D’ye think so, Timothy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, coming forward to
Fairway's side with sudden depression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Then a man may feel
for years that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is good solid company, and be wrong about himself
after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that question, Grandfer. Stir your stumps and get some more
sticks. `Tis very nonsense of an old man to prattle so when life and
death's in mangling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, with melancholy conviction. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
this is a bad night altogether for them that have done well in their
time; and if I were ever such a dab at the hautboy or tenor viol, I
shouldn't have the heart to play tunes upon `em now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div><p/>Susan now arrived with the frying pan, when the live adder was killed
and the heads of the three taken off. The remainders, being cut into
lengths and split open, were tossed into the pan, which began hissing
and crackling over the fire. Soon a rill of clear oil trickled from the
carcases, whereupon Clym dipped the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) handkerchief into the
liquid and anointed the wound.




<p/>8--Eustacia Hears of Good Fortune, and Beholds Evil


<p/>In the meantime Eustacia, left alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cottage at Alderworth,
had become considerably depressed by the posture of affairs. The
consequences which might result from Clym's discovery that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother
had been turned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) door that day were likely to be disagreeable,
and this was a quality in events which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hated as much as the
dreadful.

<p/>To be left to pass the evening by herself was irksome to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at any
time, and this evening it was more irksome than usual by reason of
the excitements of the past hours. The two visits had stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into
restlessness. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not wrought to any great pitch of uneasiness by
the probability of appearing in an ill light in the discussion between
Clym and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was wrought to vexation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) slumbering
activities were quickened to the extent of wishing that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had opened
the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had certainly believed that Clym was awake, and the excuse
would be an honest one as far as it went; but nothing could save her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
from censure in refusing to answer at the first knock. Yet, instead of
blaming herself for the issue she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laid the fault upon the shoulders
of some indistinct, colossal Prince of the World, who had framed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
situation and ruled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lot.

<p/>At this time of the year it was pleasanter to walk by night than by day,
and when Clym had been absent about an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suddenly resolved to go
out in the direction of Blooms-End, on the chance of meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
return. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reached the garden gate she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard wheels approaching,
and looking round beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandfather coming up in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) car.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stay a minute, thank ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) answered to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) greeting. <div class="bookquote">``I am
driving to East Egdon; but I came round here just to tell you the news.
Perhaps you have heard--about Mr. Wildeve's fortune?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia blankly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) has come into a fortune of eleven thousand pounds--uncle died
in Canada, just after hearing that all his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) family, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was sending
home, had gone to the bottom in the Cassiopeia; so Wildeve has come into
everything, without in the least expecting it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia stood motionless awhile. <div class="bookquote">``How long has he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) known of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it was known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) this morning early, for I knew it at ten
o’clock, when Charley came back. Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) is what I call a lucky man.
What a fool you were, Eustacia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes in apparent calmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, in not sticking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) when you had him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know there had ever been anything between you till lately;
and, faith, I should have been hot and strong against it if I had known;
but since it seems that there was some sniffing between ye, why the
deuce didn't you stick to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia made no reply, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could say as much upon
that subject as he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) chose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how is your poor purblind husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>continued the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Not a
bad fellow either, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a good thing for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cousin what-d’ye-call-her? By George, you
ought to have been in that galley, my girl! Now I must drive on. Do you
want any assistance? What's mine is yours, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Grandfather, we are not in want at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said
coldly. <div class="bookquote">``Clym cuts furze, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) does it mostly as a useful pastime,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) can do nothing else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) is paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) pastime, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)? Three shillings a hundred, I
heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clym has money,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, colouring, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) likes to earn a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; good night.''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>And the captain drove on.

<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather was gone Eustacia went on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) way mechanically;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) thoughts were no longer concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mother-in-law and Clym.
Wildeve, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) complaints against his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) fate, had been
seized upon by destiny and placed in the sunshine once more. Eleven
thousand pounds! From every Egdon point of view he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) was a rich man. In
Eustacia's eyes, too, it was an ample sum--one sufficient to supply
those wants of hers which had been stigmatized by Clym in his (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) more
austere moods as vain and luxurious. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was no lover of money
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) loved what money could bring; and the new accessories she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
imagined around him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) clothed Wildeve with a great deal of interest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
recollected now how quietly well-dressed he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had been that morning--he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
had probably put on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) newest suit, regardless of damage by briars and
thorns. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) manner towards herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O I see it, I see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``How much he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) had me now,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) might give me all I desire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In recalling the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) glances and words--at the time scarcely
regarded--it became plain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) how greatly they had been dictated
by his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knowledge of this new event. <div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) been a man to bear a jilt
ill-will he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) would have told me of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) good fortune in crowing tones;
instead of doing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) mentioned not a word, in deference to my
misfortunes, and merely implied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) loved me still, as one superior
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve's silence that day on what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was just the kind
of behaviour calculated to make an impression on such a woman. Those
delicate touches of good taste were, in fact, one of the strong points
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) demeanour towards the other sex. The peculiarity of Wildeve was
that, while at one time passionate, upbraiding, and resentful towards a
woman, at another he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would treat her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with such unparalleled grace as
to make previous neglect appear as no discourtesy, injury as no insult,
interference as a delicate attention, and the ruin of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) honour as
excess of chivalry. This man, whose admiration today Eustacia had
disregarded, whose good wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had scarcely taken the trouble to
accept, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had shown out of the house by the back door, was
the possessor of eleven thousand pounds--a man of fair professional
education, and one who had served his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) articles with a civil engineer.

<p/>So intent was Eustacia upon Wildeve's fortunes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) forgot how much
closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own course were those of Clym; and instead of walking on
to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sat down upon a stone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was disturbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
reverie by a voice behind, and turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head beheld the old lover and
fortunate inheritor of wealth immediately beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remained sitting, though the fluctuation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) look might have told
any man who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) so well as Wildeve that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) clear low tone. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you
were at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I went on to the village after leaving your garden; and now I have come
back again--that's all. Which way are you walking, may I ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand in the direction of Blooms-End. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to meet
my husband. I think I may possibly have got into trouble whilst you were
with me today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could that be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By not letting in Mrs. Yeobright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that visit of mine did you no harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None. It was not your fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/>By this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had risen; and they involuntarily sauntered on
together, without speaking, for two or three minutes; when Eustacia
broke silence by saying, <div class="bookquote">``I assume I must congratulate you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On what? O yes; on my eleven thousand pounds, you mean. Well, since I
didn't get something else, I must be content with getting that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem very indifferent about it. Why didn't you tell me today when
you came?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said in the tone of a neglected person. <div class="bookquote">``I heard of it
quite by accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did mean to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``But I--well, I will speak
frankly--I did not like to mention it when I saw, Eustacia, that your
star was not high. The sight of a man lying wearied out with hard work,
as your husband lay, made me feel that to brag of my own fortune to you
would be greatly out of place. Yet, as you stood there beside him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), I
could not help feeling too that in many respects he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a richer man
than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>At this Eustacia said, with slumbering mischievousness, <div class="bookquote">``What, would you
exchange with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--your fortune for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As we are imagining what is impossible and absurd, suppose we change
the subject?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; and I will tell you of my plans for the future, if you care
to hear them. I shall permanently invest nine thousand pounds, keep one
thousand as ready money, and with the remaining thousand travel for a
year or so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Travel? What a bright idea! Where will you go to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From here to Paris, where I shall pass the winter and spring. Then I
shall go to Italy, Greece, Egypt, and Palestine, before the hot weather
comes on. In the summer I shall go to America; and then, by a plan not
yet settled, I shall go to Australia and round to India. By that time
I shall have begun to have had enough of it. Then I shall probably come
back to Paris again, and there I shall stay as long as I can afford to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Back to Paris again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) murmured in a voice that was nearly a sigh.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had never once told Wildeve of the Parisian desires which Clym's
description had sown in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); yet here was he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) involuntarily in a position
to gratify them. <div class="bookquote">``You think a good deal of Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. In my opinion it is the central beauty-spot of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in mine! And Thomasin will go with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cares to. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may prefer to stay at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you will be going about, and I shall be staying here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you will. But we know whose fault that is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not blaming you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I thought you were. If ever you SHOULD be inclined to blame me,
think of a certain evening by Rainbarrow, when you promised to meet me
and did not. You sent me a letter; and my heart ached to read that as
I hope yours never will. That was one point of divergence. I then did
something in haste... But she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is a good woman, and I will say no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that the blame was on my side that time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia. <div class="bookquote">``But it
had not always been so. However, it is my misfortune to be too sudden in
feeling. O, Damon, don't reproach me any more--I can't bear that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>They went on silently for a distance of two or three miles, when
Eustacia said suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you come out of your way, Mr. Wildeve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My way is anywhere tonight. I will go with you as far as the hill on
which we can see Blooms-End, as it is getting late for you to be alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't trouble. I am not obliged to be out at all. I think I would
rather you did not accompany me further. This sort of thing would have
an odd look if known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, I will leave you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand unexpectedly, and kissed
it--for the first time since her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) marriage. <div class="bookquote">``What light is that on the
hill?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) added, as it were to hide the caress.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) looked, and saw a flickering firelight proceeding from the open side
of a hovel a little way before them. The hovel, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had hitherto
always found empty, seemed to be inhabited now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you have come so far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia, <div class="bookquote">``will you see me safely
past that hut? I thought I should have met Clym somewhere about here,
but as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't appear I will hasten on and get to Blooms-End before
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) leaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>They advanced to the turf-shed, and when they got near it the firelight
and the lantern inside showed distinctly enough the form of a woman
reclining on a bed of fern, a group of heath men and women standing
around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Eustacia did not recognize Mrs. Yeobright in the reclining
figure, nor Clym as one of the standers-by till she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) came close. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) quickly pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand up on Wildeve's arm and signified to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) to
come back from the open side of the shed into the shadow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my husband and his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) whispered in an agitated voice.
<div class="bookquote">``What can it mean? Will you step forward and tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve left her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) side and went to the back wall of the hut. Presently
Eustacia perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was beckoning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) advanced and
joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a serious case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/>From their position they could hear what was proceeding inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could have been going,''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>said Clym to someone.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had evidently walked a long way, but even when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was able to
speak just now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not tell me where. What do you really think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a great deal to fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>was gravely answered, in a voice which
Eustacia recognized as that of the only surgeon in the district. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
has suffered somewhat from the bite of the adder; but it is exhaustion
which has overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). My impression is that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walk must have been
exceptionally long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not to overwalk herself this weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym,
with distress. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think we did well in using the adder's fat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is a very ancient remedy--the old remedy of the
viper-catchers, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``It is mentioned as
an infallible ointment by Hoffman, Mead, and I think the Abbe Fontana.
Undoubtedly it was as good a thing as you could do; though I question if
some other oils would not have been equally efficacious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here, come here!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>was then rapidly said in anxious female tones,
and Clym and the doctor could be heard rushing forward from the back
part of the shed to where Mrs. Yeobright lay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>whispered Eustacia.

<p/>```Twas Thomasin who spoke,'' said Wildeve. <div class="bookquote">``Then they have fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). I
wonder if I had better go in--yet it might do harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For a long time there was utter silence among the group within; and it
was broken at last by Clym saying, in an agonized voice, <div class="bookquote">``O Doctor, what
does it mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor did not reply at once; ultimately he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is sinking
fast. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heart was previously affected, and physical exhaustion has
dealt the finishing blow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there was a weeping of women, then waiting, then hushed
exclamations, then a strange gasping sound, then a painful stillness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/>Further back in the hut the cotters whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Yeobright is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the watchers</b></font>)</div><p/>Almost at the same moment the two watchers observed the form of a
small old-fashioned child entering at the open side of the shed. Susan
Nunsuch, whose boy it was, went forward to the opening and silently
beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to go back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got something to tell `ee, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried in a shrill tone.
<div class="bookquote">``That woman asleep there walked along with me today; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said I was
to say that I had seed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a broken-hearted woman and cast
off by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son, and then I came on home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>A confused sob as from a man was heard within, upon which Eustacia
gasped faintly, <div class="bookquote">``That's Clym--I must go to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)--yet dare I do it?
No--come away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>When they had withdrawn from the neighbourhood of the shed she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said
huskily, <div class="bookquote">``I am to blame for this. There is evil in store for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not admitted to your house after all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>Wildeve inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, and that's where it all lies! Oh, what shall I do! I shall not
intrude upon them--I shall go straight home. Damon, good-bye! I cannot
speak to you any more now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They parted company; and when Eustacia had reached the next hill she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
looked back. A melancholy procession was wending its way by the light of
the lantern from the hut towards Blooms-End. Wildeve was nowhere to be
seen.





<p/>BOOK FIVE -- THE DISCOVERY




<p/>1--<div class="bookquote">``Wherefore Is Light Given to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) That Is in Misery''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeobright/Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>One evening, about three weeks after the funeral of Mrs. Yeobright, when
the silver face of the moon sent a bundle of beams directly upon the
floor of Clym's house at Alderworth, a woman came forth from within. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
reclined over the garden gate as if to refresh herself awhile. The pale
lunar touches which make beauties of hags lent divinity to this face,
already beautiful.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not long been there when a man came up the road and with some
hesitation said to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``How is he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) tonight, ma’am, if you please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) is better, though still very unwell, Humphrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>replied Eustacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) light-headed, ma’am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) is quite sensible now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) rave about his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) mother just the same, poor fellow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>continued
Humphrey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as much, though not quite so wildly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very unfortunate, ma’am, that the boy Johnny should ever ha'
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) mother's dying words, about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being broken-hearted and
cast off by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son. `Twas enough to upset any man alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia made no reply beyond that of a slight catch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) breath, as
of one who fain would speak but could not; and Humphrey, declining her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
invitation to come in, went away.

<p/>Eustacia turned, entered the house, and ascended to the front bedroom,
where a shaded light was burning. In the bed lay Clym, pale, haggard,
wide awake, tossing to one side and to the other, his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) eyes lit by a hot
light, as if the fire in their pupils were burning up their substance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it you, Eustacia?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Clym. I have been down to the gate. The moon is shining
beautifully, and there is not a leaf stirring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shining, is it? What's the moon to a man like me? Let it shine--let
anything be, so that I never see another day!... Eustacia, I don't know
where to look--my thoughts go through me like swords. O, if any man
wants to make himself immortal by painting a picture of wretchedness,
let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help feeling that I did my best to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Clym.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was so; it is useless to excuse me! My conduct to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was too
hideous--I made no advances; and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could not bring herself to forgive
me. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is dead! If I had only shown myself willing to make it up
with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sooner, and we had been friends, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had died, it
wouldn't be so hard to bear. But I never went near her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) house, so
she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) never came near mine, and didn't know how welcome she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would have
been--that's what troubles me. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) did not know I was going to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) house
that very night, for she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was too insensible to understand me. If she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had
only come to see me! I longed that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would. But it was not to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There escaped from Eustacia one of those shivering sighs which used to
shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) like a pestilent blast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had not yet told.

<p/>But Yeobright was too deeply absorbed in the ramblings incidental to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) remorseful state to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). During his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) illness he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) had been
continually talking thus. Despair had been added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) original grief
by the unfortunate disclosure of the boy who had received the last
words of Mrs. Yeobright--words too bitterly uttered in an hour of
misapprehension. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) distress had overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) longed
for death as a field labourer longs for the shade. It was the pitiful
sight of a man standing in the very focus of sorrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continually
bewailed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tardy journey to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's house, because it was an
error which could never be rectified, and insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have
been horribly perverted by some fiend not to have thought before that it
was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), since she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
ask Eustacia to agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) self-condemnation; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>),
seared inwardly by a secret she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) dared not tell, declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could
not give an opinion, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``That's because you didn't know my
mother's nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was always ready to forgive if asked to do so;
but I seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to be as an obstinate child, and that made
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unyielding. Yet not unyielding--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was proud and reserved, no
more... Yes, I can understand why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) held out against me so long. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was waiting for me. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said a hundred times in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sorrow,
`What a return he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) makes for all the sacrifices I have made for him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!' I
never went to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)! When I set out to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) it was too late. To think
of that is nearly intolerable!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sometimes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition had been one of utter remorse, unsoftened by a
single tear of pure sorrow: and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writhed as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay, fevered
far more by thought than by physical ills. <div class="bookquote">``If I could only get one
assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not die in a belief that I was resentful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said one day when in this mood, <div class="bookquote">``it would be better to think of than a
hope of heaven. But that I cannot do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You give yourself up too much to this wearying despair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.
<div class="bookquote">``Other men's mothers have died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't make the loss of mine less. Yet it is less the loss than
the circumstances of the loss. I sinned against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and on that account
there is no light for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sinned against you, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not. I committed the guilt; and may the whole burden be
upon my head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you might consider twice before you say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>Eustacia
replied. <div class="bookquote">``Single men have, no doubt, a right to curse themselves as much
as they please; but men with wives involve two in the doom they pray
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in too sorry a state to understand what you are refining on,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said
the wretched man. <div class="bookquote">``Day and night shout at me, `You have helped to kill
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).' But in loathing myself I may, I own, be unjust to you, my poor
wife. Forgive me for it, Eustacia, for I scarcely know what I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia was always anxious to avoid the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband in such
a state as this, which had become as dreadful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) as the trial scene
was to Judas Iscariot. It brought before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes the spectre of a
worn-out woman knocking at a door which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would not open; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
shrank from contemplating it. Yet it was better for Yeobright himself
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) spoke openly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) sharp regret, for in silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) endured
infinitely more, and would sometimes remain so long in a tense, brooding
mood, consuming himself by the gnawing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) thought, that it was
imperatively necessary to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) talk aloud, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) grief might in
some degree expend itself in the effort.

<p/>Eustacia had not been long indoors after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) look at the moonlight when
a soft footstep came up to the house, and Thomasin was announced by the
woman downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Thomasin! Thank you for coming tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Clym when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entered
the room. <div class="bookquote">``Here am I, you see. Such a wretched spectacle am I, that I
shrink from being seen by a single friend, and almost from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not shrink from me, dear Clym,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin earnestly, in
that sweet voice of hers which came to a sufferer like fresh air into a
Black Hole. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing in you can ever shock me or drive me away. I have
been here before, but you don't remember it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do; I am not delirious, Thomasin, nor have I been so at all.
Don't you believe that if they say so. I am only in great misery at what
I have done, and that, with the weakness, makes me seem mad. But it
has not upset my reason. Do you think I should remember all about my
mother's death if I were out of my mind? No such good luck. Two months
and a half, Thomasin, the last of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life, did my poor mother live
alone, distracted and mourning because of me; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was unvisited
by me, though I was living only six miles off. Two months and a
half--seventy-five days did the sun rise and set upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in that
deserted state which a dog didn't deserve! Poor people who had nothing
in common with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and visited her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had they
known her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sickness and loneliness; but I, who should have been all to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), stayed away like a cur. If there is any justice in God let Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kill
me now. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has nearly blinded me, but that is not enough. If He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would
only strike me with more pain I would believe in Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush! O, pray, Clym, don't, don't say it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>implored Thomasin,
affrighted into sobs and tears; while Eustacia, at the other side of
the room, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) pale face remained calm, writhed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) chair. Clym
went on without heeding his (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not worth receiving further proof even of Heaven's
reprobation. Do you think, Thomasin, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew me--that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not
die in that horrid mistaken notion about my not forgiving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), which I
can't tell you how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) acquired? If you could only assure me of that! Do
you think so, Eustacia? Do speak to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I can assure you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew better at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin.
The pallid Eustacia said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) come to my house? I would have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in and showed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) how I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in spite of all. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) never came; and I didn't go
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) died on the heath like an animal kicked out, nobody to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) till it was too late. If you could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), Thomasin, as
I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)--a poor dying woman, lying in the dark upon the bare ground,
moaning, nobody near, believing she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was utterly deserted by all the
world, it would have moved you to anguish, it would have moved a brute.
And this poor woman my mother! No wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said to the child, `You
have seen a broken-hearted woman.' What a state she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must have been
brought to, to say that! and who can have done it but I? It is too
dreadful to think of, and I wish I could be punished more heavily than I
am. How long was I what they called out of my senses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A week, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then I became calm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, for four days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I have left off being calm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But try to be quiet--please do, and you will soon be strong. If you
could remove that impression from your mind--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) said impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't want to get strong. What's
the use of my getting well? It would be better for me if I die, and it
would certainly be better for Eustacia. Is Eustacia there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be better for you, Eustacia, if I were to die?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't press such a question, dear Clym.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it really is but a shadowy supposition; for unfortunately I am
going to live. I feel myself getting better. Thomasin, how long are
you going to stay at the inn, now that all this money has come to your
husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another month or two, probably; until my illness is over. We cannot get
off till then. I think it will be a month or more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. Of course. Ah, Cousin Tamsie, you will get over your

to console you; but I shall never get over mine, and no consolation will
come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clym, you are unjust to yourself. Depend upon it, Aunt thought kindly
of you. I know that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had lived, you would have been reconciled
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) didn't come to see me, though I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), before I married, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) would come. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) come, or had I gone there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) would never have
died saying, `I am a broken-hearted woman, cast off by my son.' My door
has always been open to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--a welcome here has always awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never came to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better not talk any more now, Clym,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia faintly from
the other part of the room, for the scene was growing intolerable to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me talk to you instead for the little time I shall be here,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Thomasin said soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``Consider what a one-sided way you have of
looking at the matter, Clym. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said that to the little boy you
had not found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and taken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into your arms; and it might have been
uttered in a moment of bitterness. It was rather like Aunt to say things
in haste. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) sometimes used to speak so to me. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) did not come
I am convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) thought of coming to see you. Do you suppose
a man's mother could live two or three months without one forgiving
thought? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forgave me; and why should she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not have forgiven you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You laboured to win her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) round; I did nothing. I, who was going to teach
people the higher secrets of happiness, did not know how to keep out of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you get here tonight, Thomasin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damon set me down at the end of the lane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) has driven into East Egdon
on business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) will come and pick me up by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Accordingly they soon after heard the noise of wheels. Wildeve had come,
and was waiting outside with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) horse and gig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send out and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) I will be down in two minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will run down myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went down. Wildeve had alighted, and was standing before the horse's
head when Eustacia opened the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) did not turn for a moment,
thinking the comer Thomasin. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) looked, startled ever so little,
and said one word: <div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not yet told him (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't do so till he (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) is well--it will be fatal. You are ill
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am wretched... O Damon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, bursting into tears, <div class="bookquote">``I--I can't

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, visibly affected at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) distress, and at
last led on so far as to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``It is hard, when you have done
nothing to deserve it, that you should have got involved in such a web
as this. You were not made for these sad scenes. I am to blame most. If
I could only have saved you from it all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Damon, please pray tell me what I must do? To sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) hour
after hour, and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) reproach himself as being the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
death, and to know that I am the sinner, if any human being is at all,
drives me into cold despair. I don't know what to do. Should I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)
or should I not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)? I always am asking myself that. O, I want to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>); and yet I am afraid. If he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) finds it out he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) must surely kill me,
for nothing else will be in proportion to his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) feelings now. `Beware the
fury of a patient man' sounds day by day in my ears as I watch him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) is better, and trust to chance. And when you tell,
you must only tell part--for his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) own sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which part should I keep back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve paused. <div class="bookquote">``That I was in the house at the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said in a low
tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it must be concealed, seeing what has been whispered. How much
easier are hasty actions than speeches that will excuse them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) were only to die--''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>Wildeve murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not think of it! I would not buy hope of immunity by so cowardly
a desire even if I hated him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>). Now I am going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) again. Thomasin
bade me tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) would be down in a few minutes. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) returned, and Thomasin soon appeared. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was seated in the gig
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband, and the horse was turning to go off, Wildeve lifted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) eyes to the bedroom windows. Looking from one of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) could
discern a pale, tragic face watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) drive away. It was Eustacia's.




<p/>2--A Lurid Light Breaks in upon a Darkened Understanding


<p/>Clym's grief became mitigated by wearing itself out. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) strength
returned, and a month after the visit of Thomasin he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) might have been
seen walking about the garden. Endurance and despair, equanimity and
gloom, the tints of health and the pallor of death, mingled weirdly
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was now unnaturally silent upon all of the past that
related to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mother; and though Eustacia knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was thinking
of it none the less, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was only too glad to escape the topic ever to
bring it up anew. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mind had been weaker his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) heart had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) to
speak out; but reason having now somewhat recovered itself he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) sank into
taciturnity.

<p/>One evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was thus standing in the garden, abstractedly
spudding up a weed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) stick, a bony figure turned the corner of
the house and came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Christian, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad you have found me out. I
shall soon want you to go to Blooms-End and assist me in putting the
house in order. I suppose it is all locked up as I left it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mister Clym.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you dug up the potatoes and other roots?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, without a drop o' rain, thank God. But I was coming to tell `ee of
something else which is quite different from what we have lately had in
the family. I am sent by the rich gentleman at the Woman, that we used
to call the landlord, to tell `ee that Mrs. Wildeve is doing well of a
girl, which was born punctually at one o’clock at noon, or a few minutes
more or less; and `tis said that expecting of this increase is what have
kept `em there since they came into their money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) is getting on well, you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. Only Mr. Wildeve is twanky because `tisn't a boy--that's what
they say in the kitchen, but I was not supposed to notice that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Christian, now listen to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sure, Mr. Yeobright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see my mother the day before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I did not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright's face expressed disappointment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I zeed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the morning of the same day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym's look lighted up. <div class="bookquote">``That's nearer still to my meaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said.

<p/>``Yes, I know `twas the same day; for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, `I be going to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>),
Christian; so I shall not want any vegetables brought in for dinner.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See you. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was going to your house, you understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright regarded Christian with intense surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Why did you never
mention this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Are you sure it was my house she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was coming
to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes. I didn't mention it because I've never zeed you lately. And as
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't get there it was all nought, and nothing to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have been wondering why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should have walked in the heath on
that hot day! Well, did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) say what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was coming for? It is a thing,
Christian, I am very anxious to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mister Clym. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't say it to me, though I think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did to
one here and there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know one person to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is one man, please, sir, but I hope you won't mention my name
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in strange places, particular in dreams. One
night last summer he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glared at me like Famine and Sword, and it made
me feel so low that I didn't comb out my few hairs for two days. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
standing, as it might be, Mister Yeobright, in the middle of the path to
Mistover, and your mother came up, looking as pale--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, when was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Last summer, in my dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! Who's the man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Diggory, the reddleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) called upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the evening
before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) set out to see you. I hadn't gone home from work when he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) came
up to the gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see Venn--I wish I had known it before,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``I
wonder why he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) has not come to tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) went out of Egdon Heath the next day, so would not be likely to know
you wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym, <div class="bookquote">``you must go and find Venn. I am otherwise
engaged, or I would go myself. Find him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) at once, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) I want to
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a good hand at hunting up folk by day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian, looking
dubiously round at the declining light; <div class="bookquote">``but as to night-time, never is
such a bad hand as I, Mister Yeobright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Search the heath when you will, so that you bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) soon. Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)
tomorrow, if you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Christian then departed. The morrow came, but no Venn. In the evening
Christian arrived, looking very weary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had been searching all day,
and had heard nothing of the reddleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Inquire as much as you can tomorrow without neglecting your work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said
Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``Don't come again till you have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day Yeobright set out for the old house at Blooms-End, which,
with the garden, was now his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own. His (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) severe illness had hindered all
preparations for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) removal thither; but it had become necessary that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) should go and overlook its contents, as administrator to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mother's
little property; for which purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) decided to pass the next night on
the premises.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) journeyed onward, not quickly or decisively, but in the slow walk
of one who has been awakened from a stupefying sleep. It was early
afternoon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) reached the valley. The expression of the place, the
tone of the hour, were precisely those of many such occasions in days
gone by; and these antecedent similarities fostered the illusion that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), who was there no longer, would come out to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>). The garden
gate was locked and the shutters were closed, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) himself had
left them on the evening after the funeral. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) unlocked the gate, and
found that a spider had already constructed a large web, tying the door
to the lintel, on the supposition that it was never to be opened again.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had entered the house and flung back the shutters he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) set about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) task of overhauling the cupboards and closets, burning papers, and
considering how best to arrange the place for Eustacia's reception,
until such time as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) might be in a position to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
long-delayed scheme, should that time ever arrive.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) surveyed the rooms he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) felt strongly disinclined for the
alterations which would have to be made in the time-honoured furnishing
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) parents and grandparents, to suit Eustacia's modern ideas. The
gaunt oak-cased clock, with the picture of the Ascension on the
door panel and the Miraculous Draught of Fishes on the base; his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
grandmother's corner cupboard with the glass door, through which the
spotted china was visible; the dumb-waiter; the wooden tea trays; the
hanging fountain with the brass tap--whither would these venerable
articles have to be banished?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) noticed that the flowers in the window had died for want of water,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) placed them out upon the ledge, that they might be taken away.
While thus engaged he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) heard footsteps on the gravel without, and
somebody knocked at the door.

<p/>Yeobright opened it, and Venn was standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman. <div class="bookquote">``Is Mrs. Yeobright at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright looked upon the ground. <div class="bookquote">``Then you have not seen Christian or
any of the Egdon folks?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I have only just returned after a long stay away. I called here the
day before I left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have heard nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother is--dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Venn mechanically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) home now is where I shouldn't mind having mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>), and then said, <div class="bookquote">``If I didn't see your face I could
never believe your words. Have you been ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had an illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the change! When I parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a month ago everything seemed
to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was going to begin a new life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what seemed came true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say right, no doubt. Trouble has taught you a deeper vein of talk
than mine. All I meant was regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life here. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has died too
soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps through my living too long. I have had a bitter experience on
that score this last month, Diggory. But come in; I have been wanting to
see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) conducted the reddleman into the large room where the dancing had
taken place the previous Christmas, and they sat down in the settle
together. <div class="bookquote">``There's the cold fireplace, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``When that
half-burnt log and those cinders were alight she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was alive! Little has
been changed here yet. I can do nothing. My life creeps like a snail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How came she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to die?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn.

<p/>Yeobright gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) some particulars of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) illness and death, and
continued: <div class="bookquote">``After this no kind of pain will ever seem more than an
indisposition to me. I began saying that I wanted to ask you something,
but I stray from subjects like a drunken man. I am anxious to know what
my mother said to you when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last saw you. You talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a long
time, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) more than half an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And it must have been on account of what we said that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was on
the heath. Without question she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was coming to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) come to see me if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt so bitterly against me?
There's the mystery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet I know she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) quite forgave `ee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Diggory--would a woman, who had quite forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son, say,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt herself ill on the way to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) house, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
broken-hearted because of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ill-usage? Never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I know is that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't blame you at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blamed herself for
what had happened, and only herself. I had it from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own lips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had it from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips that I had NOT ill-treated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and at the
same time another had it from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips that I HAD ill-treated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? My
mother was no impulsive woman who changed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opinion every hour without
reason. How can it be, Venn, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should have told such different
stories in close succession?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say. It is certainly odd, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had forgiven you, and had
forgiven your wife, and was going to see ye on purpose to make friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there was one thing wanting to bewilder me it was this
incomprehensible thing!... Diggory, if we, who remain alive, were only
allowed to hold conversation with the dead--just once, a bare minute,
even through a screen of iron bars, as with persons in prison--what we
might learn! How many who now ride smiling would hide their heads! And
this mystery--I should then be at the bottom of it at once. But the
grave has forever shut her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) in; and how shall it be found out now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>No reply was returned by his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) companion, since none could be given; and
when Venn left, a few minutes later, Clym had passed from the dullness
of sorrow to the fluctuation of carking incertitude.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) continued in the same state all the afternoon. A bed was made up for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) in the same house by a neighbour, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) might not have to return
again the next day; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) retired to rest in the deserted place it
was only to remain awake hour after hour thinking the same thoughts. How
to discover a solution to this riddle of death seemed a query of more
importance than highest problems of the living. There was housed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
memory a vivid picture of the face of a little boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) entered the
hovel where Clym's mother lay. The round eyes, eager gaze, the piping
voice which enunciated the words, had operated like stilettos on his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
brain.

<p/>A visit to the boy suggested itself as a means of gleaning new
particulars; though it might be quite unproductive. To probe a child's
mind after the lapse of six weeks, not for facts which the child had
seen and understood, but to get at those which were in their nature
beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>), did not promise much; yet when every obvious channel is
blocked we grope towards the small and obscure. There was nothing else
left to do; after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) would allow the enigma to drop into the abyss
of undiscoverable things.

<p/>It was about daybreak when he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had reached this decision, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) at once
arose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) locked up the house and went out into the green patch which
merged in heather further on. In front of the white garden-palings the
path branched into three like a broad arrow. The road to the right
led to the Quiet Woman and its neighbourhood; the middle track led to
Mistover Knap; the left-hand track led over the hill to another part
of Mistover, where the child lived. On inclining into the latter path
Yeobright felt a creeping chilliness, familiar enough to most people,
and probably caused by the unsunned morning air. In after days he (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>)
thought of it as a thing of singular significance.

<p/>When Yeobright reached the cottage of Susan Nunsuch, the mother of the
boy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sought, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) found that the inmates were not yet astir. But in
upland hamlets the transition from a-bed to abroad is surprisingly swift
and easy. There no dense partition of yawns and toilets divides humanity
by night from humanity by day. Yeobright tapped at the upper windowsill,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could reach with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walking stick; and in three or four
minutes the woman came down.

<p/>It was not till this moment that Clym recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be the person
who had behaved so barbarously to Eustacia. It partly explained the
insuavity with which the woman greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Moreover, the boy had been
ailing again; and Susan now, as ever since the night when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had
been pressed into Eustacia's service at the bonfire, attributed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
indispositions to Eustacia's influence as a witch. It was one of those
sentiments which lurk like moles underneath the visible surface of
manners, and may have been kept alive by Eustacia's entreaty to the
captain, at the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had intended to prosecute Susan for the
pricking in church, to let the matter drop; which he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) accordingly had
done.

<p/>Yeobright overcame his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) repugnance, for Susan had at least borne his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
mother no ill-will. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) asked kindly for the boy; but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) manner did not
improve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>continued Yeobright, with some hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``to ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) remembers anything more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) walk with my mother than what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) has previously told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) in a peculiar and criticizing manner. To anybody but a
half-blind man it would have said, <div class="bookquote">``You want another of the knocks which
have already laid you so low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) called the boy downstairs, asked Clym to sit down on a stool, and
continued, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Johnny, tell Mr. Yeobright anything you can call to
mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not forgotten how you walked with the poor lady on that hot
day?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy repeated the exact words he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had used on entering the hut.
Yeobright rested his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) elbow on the table and shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
hand; and the mother looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wondered how a man could want more
of what had stung him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so deeply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was going to Alderworth when you first met her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was coming away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That can't be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) walked along with me. I was coming away, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then where did you first see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Attend, and speak the truth!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; at your house was where I seed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym started up, and Susan smiled in an expectant way which did not
embellish her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) face; it seemed to mean, <div class="bookquote">``Something sinister is coming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) do at my house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went and sat under the trees at the Devil's Bellows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God! this is all news to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never told me this before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div>said Susan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mother; because I didn't like to tell `ee I had been so far. I was
picking blackhearts, and went further than I meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) do then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Looked at a man who came up and went into your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was myself--a furze-cutter, with brambles in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; `twas not you. `Twas a gentleman. You had gone in afore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now tell me what happened next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor lady went and knocked at your door, and the lady with black
hair looked out of the side window at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy's mother turned to Clym and said, <div class="bookquote">``This is something you didn't
expect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>boy mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright took no more notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) than if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been of stone. <div class="bookquote">``Go
on, go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said hoarsely to the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw the young lady look out of the window the old lady
knocked again; and when nobody came she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took up the furze-hook and
looked at it, and put it down again, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at the
faggot-bonds; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went away, and walked across to me, and
blowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) breath very hard, like this. We walked on together, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and
I, and I talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talked to me a bit, but not much, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) couldn't blow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) breath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>murmured Clym, in a low tone, and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Let's have
more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) couldn't talk much, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) couldn't walk; and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face was, O so
queer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like yours is now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman looked at Yeobright, and beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) colourless, in a cold
sweat. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't there meaning in it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said stealthily. <div class="bookquote">``What do you
think of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym fiercely. And, turning to the boy, <div class="bookquote">``And then you
left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to die?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, quickly and angrily. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to die!
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) away. Whoever says he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forsook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says what's not true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Trouble no more about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Clym, with a quivering mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did is a trifle in comparison with what he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw. Door kept
shut, did you say? Kept shut, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looking out of window? Good heart of
God!--what does it mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child shrank away from the gaze of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) questioner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>answered the mother, <div class="bookquote">``and Johnny's a God-fearing boy and
tells no lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>```Cast off by my son!' No, by my best life, dear mother, it is not so!
But by your son's, your son's--May all murderesses get the torment they
deserve!''

<p/>With these words Yeobright went forth from the little dwelling. The
pupils of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes, fixed steadfastly on blankness, were vaguely lit
with an icy shine; his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mouth had passed into the phase more or less
imaginatively rendered in studies of Oedipus. The strangest deeds were
possible to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) mood. But they were not possible to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) situation.
Instead of there being before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oedipus</b></font>) the pale face of Eustacia, and a
masculine shape unknown, there was only the imperturbable countenance
of the heath, which, having defied the cataclysmal onsets of centuries,
reduced to insignificance by its seamed and antique features the wildest
turmoil of a single man.




<p/>3--Eustacia Dresses Herself on a Black Morning


<p/>A consciousness of a vast impassivity in all which lay around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took
possession even of Yeobright in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wild walk towards Alderworth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
once before felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own person this overpowering of the fervid by
the inanimate; but then it had tended to enervate a passion far sweeter
than that which at present pervaded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was once when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood
parting from Eustacia in the moist still levels beyond the hills.

<p/>But dismissing all this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went onward home, and came to the front of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house. The blinds of Eustacia's bedroom were still closely drawn,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was no early riser. All the life visible was in the shape of
a solitary thrush cracking a small snail upon the door-stone for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
breakfast, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tapping seemed a loud noise in the general silence
which prevailed; but on going to the door Clym found it unfastened, the
young girl who attended upon Eustacia being astir in the back part of
the premises. Yeobright entered and went straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's room.

<p/>The noise of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrival must have aroused her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), for when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened the
door she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was standing before the looking glass in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) nightdress, the
ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hair gathered into one hand, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was coiling the
whole mass round her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head, previous to beginning toilette operations.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was not a woman given to speaking first at a meeting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
allowed Clym to walk across in silence, without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face in the glass. It was ashy,
haggard, and terrible. Instead of starting towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in sorrowful
surprise, as even Eustacia, undemonstrative wife as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was, would have
done in days before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) burdened herself with a secret, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remained
motionless, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the glass. And while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) looked the
carmine flush with which warmth and sound sleep had suffused her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cheeks
and neck dissolved from view, and the deathlike pallor in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face
flew across into hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was close enough to see this, and the sight
instigated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what is the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said huskily. <div class="bookquote">``I see it in your face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand relinquished the rope of hair and dropped to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) side, and the
pile of tresses, no longer supported, fell from the crown of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) shoulders and over the white nightgown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright peremptorily.

<p/>The blanching process did not cease in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lips now became as
white as her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Clym, I'll speak to
you. Why do you return so early? Can I do anything for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you can listen to me. It seems that my wife is not very well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your face, my dear; your face. Or perhaps it is the pale morning light
which takes your colour away? Now I am going to reveal a secret to you.
Ha-ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, that is ghastly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your laugh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's reason for ghastliness. Eustacia, you have held my happiness in
the hollow of your hand, and like a devil you have dashed it down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) started back from the dressing-table, retreated a few steps from
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and looked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the face. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! you think to frighten me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
said, with a slight laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Is it worth while? I am undefended, and
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How extraordinary!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As there is ample time I will tell you, though you know well enough.
I mean that it is extraordinary that you should be alone in my absence.
Tell me, now, where is he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) who was with you on the afternoon of the
thirty-first of August? Under the bed? Up the chimney?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>A shudder overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) and shook the light fabric of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) nightdress
throughout. <div class="bookquote">``I do not remember dates so exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot
recollect that anybody was with me besides yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The day I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice growing louder and harsher,
<div class="bookquote">``was the day you shut the door against my mother and killed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). O, it
is too much--too bad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leant over the footpiece of the bedstead for
a few moments, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); then rising again--<div class="bookquote">``Tell me,
tell me! tell me--do you hear?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, rushing up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) and seizing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) by the loose folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sleeve.

<p/>The superstratum of timidity which often overlies those who are daring
and defiant at heart had been passed through, and the mettlesome
substance of the woman was reached. The red blood inundated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face,
previously so pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said in a low voice, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with
a proud smile. <div class="bookquote">``You will not alarm me by holding on so; but it would be
a pity to tear my sleeve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of letting go he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tell me the
particulars of--my mother's death,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a hard, panting whisper;
<div class="bookquote">``or--I'll--I'll--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clym,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered slowly, <div class="bookquote">``do you think you dare do anything to me
that I dare not bear? But before you strike me listen. You will get
nothing from me by a blow, even though it should kill me, as it probably
will. But perhaps you do not wish me to speak--killing may be all you
mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kill you! Do you expect it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No less degree of rage against me will match your previous grief for
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Phew--I shall not kill you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said contemptuously, as if under a
sudden change of purpose. <div class="bookquote">``I did think of it; but--I shall not. That
would be making a martyr of you, and sending you to where she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is; and
I would keep you away from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) till the universe come to an end, if I
could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I almost wish you would kill me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with gloomy bitterness.
<div class="bookquote">``It is with no strong desire, I assure you, that I play the part I have
lately played on earth. You are no blessing, my husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shut the door--you looked out of the window upon her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--you had a
man in the house with you--you sent her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) away to die. The inhumanity--the
treachery--I will not touch you--stand away from me--and confess every
word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! I'll hold my tongue like the very death that I don't mind
meeting, even though I can clear myself of half you believe by speaking.
Yes. I will! Who of any dignity would take the trouble to clear cobwebs
from a wild man's mind after such language as this? No; let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go on,
and think his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) narrow thoughts, and run his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head into the mire. I have
other cares.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis too much--but I must spare you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor charity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By my wretched soul you sting me, Eustacia! I can keep it up, and hotly
too. Now, then, madam, tell me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, I am resolved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How often does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) write to you? Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letters--when
does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meet you? Ah, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letters! Do you tell me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll find it myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes had fallen upon a small desk that
stood near, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was accustomed to write her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to
it. It was locked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unlock this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no right to say it. That's mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Without another word he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized the desk and dashed it to the floor. The
hinge burst open, and a number of letters tumbled out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia, stepping before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with more excitement than she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
had hitherto shown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come! stand away! I must see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) looked at the letters as they lay, checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) feeling and moved
indifferently aside; when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gathered them up, and examined them.

<p/>By no stretch of meaning could any but a harmless construction be placed
upon a single one of the letters themselves. The solitary exception was
an empty envelope directed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and the handwriting was Wildeve's.
Yeobright held it up. Eustacia was doggedly silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you read, madam? Look at this envelope. Doubtless we shall find
more soon, and what was inside them. I shall no doubt be gratified by
learning in good time what a well-finished and full-blown adept in a
certain trade my lady is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you say it to me--do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) gasped.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) searched further, but found nothing more. <div class="bookquote">``What was in this letter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask the writer. Am I your hound that you should talk to me in this
way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you brave me? do you stand me out, mistress? Answer. Don't look at
me with those eyes if you would bewitch me again! Sooner than that I
die. You refuse to answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't tell you after this, if I were as innocent as the sweetest
babe in heaven!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which you are not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I am not absolutely,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I have not done what
you suppose; but if to have done no harm at all is the only innocence
recognized, I am beyond forgiveness. But I require no help from your
conscience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can resist, and resist again! Instead of hating you I could, I
think, mourn for and pity you, if you were contrite, and would confess
all. Forgive you I never can. I don't speak of your lover--I will give
you the benefit of the doubt in that matter, for it only affects me
personally. But the other--had you half-killed me, had it been that you
wilfully took the sight away from these feeble eyes of mine, I could
have forgiven you. But THAT'S too much for nature!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say no more. I will do without your pity. But I would have saved you
from uttering what you will regret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going away now. I shall leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to mind--think of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)--what goodness there was in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)--it
showed in every line of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) face! Most women, even when but slightly
annoyed, show a flicker of evil in some curl of the mouth or some corner
of the cheek; but as for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), never in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) angriest moments was there
anything malicious in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) look. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was angered quickly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) forgave
just as readily, and underneath her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) pride there was the meekness of a
child. What came of it?--what cared you? You hated her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) just as she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was
learning to love you. O! couldn't you see what was best for you, but
must bring a curse upon me, and agony and death upon her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), by doing that
cruel deed! What was the fellow's name who was keeping you company and
causing you to add cruelty to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to your wrong to me? Was it Wildeve?
Was it poor Thomasin's husband? Heaven, what wickedness! Lost your
voice, have you? It is natural after detection of that most noble
trick... Eustacia, didn't any tender thought of your own mother lead you
to think of being gentle to mine at such a time of weariness? Did not
one grain of pity enter your heart as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned away? Think what a vast
opportunity was then lost of beginning a forgiving and honest course.
Why did not you kick him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) out, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in, and say I'll be an honest
wife and a noble woman from this hour? Had I told you to go and quench
eternally our last flickering chance of happiness here you could have
done no worse. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s asleep now; and have you a hundred gallants,
neither they nor you can insult her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You exaggerate fearfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said in a faint, weary voice; <div class="bookquote">``but I
cannot enter into my defence--it is not worth doing. You are nothing to
me in future, and the past side of the story may as well remain untold.
I have lost all through you, but I have not complained. Your blunders
and misfortunes may have been a sorrow to you, but they have been a
wrong to me. All persons of refinement have been scared away from me
since I sank into the mire of marriage. Is this your cherishing--to
put me into a hut like this, and keep me like the wife of a hind? You
deceived me--not by words, but by appearances, which are less seen
through than words. But the place will serve as well as any other--as
somewhere to pass from--into my grave.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) words were smothered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)

not thought you had gone to do it yourself. When I found you had not I
opened it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gone. That's the extent of my crime--towards HER.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hastily dressed herself, Yeobright moodily walking up and down the
room the whole of the time. At last all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) things were on. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) little
hands quivered so violently as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) held them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) chin to fasten her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
bonnet that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could not tie the strings, and after a few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
relinquished the attempt. Seeing this he (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) moved forward and said, <div class="bookquote">``Let me
tie them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) assented in silence, and lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) chin. For once at least in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
life she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was totally oblivious of the charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) attitude. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
was not, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes aside, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) might not be tempted to
softness.

<p/>The strings were tied; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you still prefer going
away yourself to my leaving you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) inquired again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--let it be. And when you will confess to the man I may pity
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) shawl about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) and went downstairs, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) standing
in the room.


<p/>Eustacia had not long been gone when there came a knock at the door of
the bedroom; and Yeobright said, <div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the servant; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Somebody from Mrs. Wildeve's

the girl retired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a mockery!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``This unhappy marriage of mine to be

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>4--The Ministrations of a Half-forgotten One


<p/>Eustacia's journey was at first as vague in direction as that of
thistledown on the wind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not know what to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) wished it had
been night instead of morning, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) might at least have borne her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
misery without the possibility of being seen. Tracing mile after mile
along between the dying ferns and the wet white spiders' webs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) at
length turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) steps towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) found the
front door closed and locked. Mechanically she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went round to the end
where the stable was, and on looking in at the stable door she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) saw
Charley standing within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Vye is not at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad in a flutter of feeling; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s gone to
Weatherbury, and won't be home till night. And the servant is gone home
for a holiday. So the house is locked up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia's face was not visible to Charley as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stood at the doorway,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) back being to the sky, and the stable but indifferently lighted; but
the wildness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) manner arrested his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) attention. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned and walked
away across the enclosure to the gate, and was hidden by the bank.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had disappeared Charley, with misgiving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) eyes, slowly
came from the stable door, and going to another point in the bank he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
looked over. Eustacia was leaning against it on the outside, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face
covered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hands, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head pressing the dewy heather which
bearded the bank's outer side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) appeared to be utterly indifferent to
the circumstance that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bonnet, hair, and garments were becoming
wet and disarranged by the moisture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cold, harsh pillow. Clearly
something was wrong.

<p/>Charley had always regarded Eustacia as Eustacia had regarded Clym
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) first beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)--as a romantic and sweet vision, scarcely
incarnate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had been so shut off from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) by the dignity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) look
and the pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) speech, except at that one blissful interval when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was allowed to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had hardly deemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) a woman,
wingless and earthly, subject to household conditions and domestic jars.
The inner details of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had only conjectured. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had been a
lovely wonder, predestined to an orbit in which the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) own was
but a point; and this sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) leaning like a helpless, despairing
creature against a wild wet bank filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) with an amazed horror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
could no longer remain where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was. Leaping over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) came up, touched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) finger, and said tenderly, <div class="bookquote">``You are poorly, ma’am. What can
I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia started up, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Charley--you have followed me. You
did not think when I left home in the summer that I should come back
like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not, dear ma’am. Can I help you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid not. I wish I could get into the house. I feel
giddy--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lean on my arm, ma’am, till we get to the porch, and I will try to open
the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to the porch, and there depositing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) on a seat
hastened to the back, climbed to a window by the help of a ladder, and
descending inside opened the door. Next he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) into the room,
where there was an old-fashioned horsehair settee as large as a donkey
wagon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lay down here, and Charley covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) with a cloak he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) found
in the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I get you something to eat and drink?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, Charley. But I suppose there is no fire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can light it, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) vanished, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) heard a splitting of wood and a blowing of bellows;
and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) returned, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I have lighted a fire in the
kitchen, and now I'll light one here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) lit the fire, Eustacia dreamily observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) couch. When it
was blazing up he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I wheel you round in front of it, ma’am,
as the morning is chilly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I go and bring the victuals now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) murmured languidly.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had gone, and the dull sounds occasionally reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) ears of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) movements in the kitchen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) forgot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was, and had for a
moment to consider by an effort what the sounds meant. After an interval
which seemed short to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) whose thoughts were elsewhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) came in with
a tray on which steamed tea and toast, though it was nearly lunch-time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Place it on the table,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be ready soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) did so, and retired to the door; when, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
did not move he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) came back a few steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me hold it to you, if you don't wish to get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
brought the tray to the front of the couch, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) knelt down, adding,
<div class="bookquote">``I will hold it for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Eustacia sat up and poured out a cup of tea. <div class="bookquote">``You are very kind to me,
Charley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) murmured as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sipped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I ought to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) diffidently, taking great trouble not
to rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), though this was their only natural position,
Eustacia being immediately before him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You have been kind to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How have I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You let me hold your hand when you were a maiden at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, so I did. Why did I do that? My mind is lost--it had to do with the
mumming, had it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you wanted to go in my place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember. I do indeed remember--too well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) again became utterly downcast; and Charley, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was not
going to eat or drink any more, took away the tray.

<p/>Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) occasionally came in to see if the fire was burning, to
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) wanted anything, to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) that the wind had shifted
from south to west, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) to gather her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) some
blackberries; to all which inquiries she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) replied in the negative or with
indifference.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remained on the settee some time longer, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) aroused herself
and went upstairs. The room in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had formerly slept still
remained much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had left it, and the recollection that this forced
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own greatly changed and infinitely worsened situation
again set on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face the undetermined and formless misery which it
had worn on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) first arrival. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) peeped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather's room,
through which the fresh autumn air was blowing from the open window. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
eye was arrested by what was a familiar sight enough, though it broke
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) now with a new significance.

<p/>It was a brace of pistols, hanging near the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather's
bed, which he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) always kept there loaded, as a precaution against possible
burglars, the house being very lonely. Eustacia regarded them long, as
if they were the page of a book in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) read a new and a strange
matter. Quickly, like one afraid of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) returned downstairs and
stood in deep thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could only do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It would be doing much good to
myself and all connected with me, and no harm to a single one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea seemed to gather force within her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remained in a fixed
attitude nearly ten minutes, when a certain finality was expressed in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) gaze, and no longer the blankness of indecision.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned and went up the second time--softly and stealthily now--and
entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather's room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes at once seeking the head of the
bed. The pistols were gone.

<p/>The instant quashing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) purpose by their absence affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) brain
as a sudden vacuum affects the body--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) nearly fainted. Who had
done this? There was only one person on the premises besides herself.
Eustacia involuntarily turned to the open window which overlooked the
garden as far as the bank that bounded it. On the summit of the latter
stood Charley, sufficiently elevated by its height to see into the room.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) gaze was directed eagerly and solicitously upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went downstairs to the door and beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have taken them away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you looking at them too long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has that to do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been heart-broken all the morning, as if you did not want to
live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I could not bear to leave them in your way. There was meaning in
your look at them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are they now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Locked up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the stable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give them to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You refuse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. I care too much for you to give `em up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned aside, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face for the first time softening from the stony
immobility of the earlier day, and the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mouth resuming
something of that delicacy of cut which was always lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) moments
of despair. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I not die if I wish?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said tremulously. <div class="bookquote">``I have made
a bad bargain with life, and I am weary of it--weary. And now you have
hindered my escape. O, why did you, Charley! What makes death painful
except the thought of others' grief?--and that is absent in my case, for
not a sigh would follow me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, it is trouble that has done this! I wish in my very soul that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
who brought it about might die and rot, even if `tis transportation to
say it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley, no more of that. What do you mean to do about this you have
seen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep it close as night, if you promise not to think of it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not fear. The moment has passed. I promise.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) then went
away, entered the house, and lay down.

<p/>Later in the afternoon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather returned. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was about to
question her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) categorically, but on looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) withheld his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is too bad to talk of,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) slowly returned in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
glance. <div class="bookquote">``Can my old room be got ready for me tonight, Grandfather? I
shall want to occupy it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) did not ask what it all meant, or why she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband, but
ordered the room to be prepared.




<p/>5--An Old Move Inadvertently Repeated


<p/>Charley's attentions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) former mistress were unbounded. The only
solace to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) own trouble lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) attempts to relieve hers. Hour
after hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wants; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) presence there
with a sort of gratitude, and, while uttering imprecations on the cause
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) unhappiness, in some measure blessed the result. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
would always remain there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) thought, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) would be as happy as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had been before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) dread was lest she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) should think fit to return to
Alderworth, and in that dread his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) eyes, with all the inquisitiveness of
affection, frequently sought her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face when she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was not observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>),
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) would have watched the head of a stockdove to learn if it
contemplated flight. Having once really succoured her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and possibly
preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) from the rashest of acts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) mentally assumed in addition
a guardian's responsibility for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) welfare.

<p/>For this reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) busily endeavoured to provide her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) with pleasant
distractions, bringing home curious objects which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) found in the heath,
such as white trumpet-shaped mosses, redheaded lichens, stone arrowheads
used by the old tribes on Egdon, and faceted crystals from the hollows
of flints. These he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) deposited on the premises in such positions that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
should see them as if by accident.

<p/>A week passed, Eustacia never going out of the house. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) walked
into the enclosed plot and looked through her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather's spyglass, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had been in the habit of doing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) marriage. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
saw, at a place where the highroad crossed the distant valley, a heavily
laden wagon passing along. It was piled with household furniture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
looked again and again, and recognized it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own. In the evening
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather came indoors with a rumour that Yeobright had removed
that day from Alderworth to the old house at Blooms-End.

<p/>On another occasion when reconnoitring thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) beheld two female
figures walking in the vale. The day was fine and clear; and the persons
not being more than half a mile off she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could see their every detail
with the telescope. The woman walking in front carried a white bundle
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, from one end of which hung a long appendage of drapery; and
when the walkers turned, so that the sun fell more directly upon them,
Eustacia could see that the object was a baby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) called Charley, and
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) knew who they were, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) well guessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Wildeve and the nurse-girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The nurse is carrying the baby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, `tis Mrs. Wildeve carrying that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``and the nurse walks
behind carrying nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad was in good spirits that day, for the Fifth of November had
again come round, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was planning yet another scheme to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) too absorbing thoughts. For two successive years his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
mistress had seemed to take pleasure in lighting a bonfire on the bank
overlooking the valley; but this year she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had apparently quite forgotten
the day and the customary deed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was careful not to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and
went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) secret preparations for a cheerful surprise, the more
zealously that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had been absent last time and unable to assist. At
every vacant minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) hastened to gather furze-stumps, thorn-tree
roots, and other solid materials from the adjacent slopes, hiding them
from cursory view.

<p/>The evening came, and Eustacia was still seemingly unconscious of the
anniversary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had gone indoors after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) survey through the glass,
and had not been visible since. As soon as it was quite dark Charley
began to build the bonfire, choosing precisely that spot on the bank
which Eustacia had chosen at previous times.

<p/>When all the surrounding bonfires had burst into existence Charley
kindled his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), and arranged its fuel so that it should not require tending
for some time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) then went back to the house, and lingered round the
door and windows till she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) should by some means or other learn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
achievement and come out to witness it. But the shutters were closed,
the door remained shut, and no heed whatever seemed to be taken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
performance. Not liking to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) went back and replenished the
fire, continuing to do this for more than half an hour. It was not till
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) stock of fuel had greatly diminished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) went to the back door
and sent in to beg that Mrs. Yeobright would open the window-shutters
and see the sight outside.

<p/>Eustacia, who had been sitting listlessly in the parlour, started up
at the intelligence and flung open the shutters. Facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) on the bank
blazed the fire, which at once sent a ruddy glare into the room where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was, and overpowered the candles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, Charley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Vye from the chimney-corner. <div class="bookquote">``But I
hope it is not my wood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'s burning... Ah, it was this time last
year that I met with that man Venn, bringing home Thomasin Yeobright--to
be sure it was! Well, who would have thought that girl's troubles would
have ended so well? What a snipe you were in that matter, Eustacia! Has
your husband written to you yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>said Eustacia, looking vaguely through the window at the fire,
which just then so much engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not resent her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
grandfather's blunt opinion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could see Charley's form on the bank,
shovelling and stirring the fire; and there flashed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) imagination
some other form which that fire might call up.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) left the room, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) garden bonnet and cloak, and went out.
Reaching the bank, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) looked over with a wild curiosity and misgiving,
when Charley said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), with a pleased sense of himself, <div class="bookquote">``I made it o'
purpose for you, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said hastily. <div class="bookquote">``But I wish you to put it out now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will soon burn down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley, rather disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``Is it not
a pity to knock it out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) musingly answered.

<p/>They stood in silence, broken only by the crackling of the flames,
till Charley, perceiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not want to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), moved
reluctantly away.

<p/>Eustacia remained within the bank looking at the fire, intending to go
indoors, yet lingering still. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) situation been inclined
to hold in indifference all things honoured of the gods and of men she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
would probably have come away. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) state was so hopeless that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
could play with it. To have lost is less disturbing than to wonder if we
may possibly have won; and Eustacia could now, like other people at such
a stage, take a standing-point outside herself, observe herself as a
disinterested spectator, and think what a sport for Heaven this woman
Eustacia was.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stood she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) heard a sound. It was the splash of a stone in the
pond.

<p/>Had Eustacia received the stone full in the bosom her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) heart could not
have given a more decided thump. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had thought of the possibility
of such a signal in answer to that which had been unwittingly given by
Charley; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had not expected it yet. How prompt Wildeve was! Yet
how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) think her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) capable of deliberately wishing to renew their
assignations now? An impulse to leave the spot, a desire to stay,
struggled within her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); and the desire held its own. More than that it did
not do, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) refrained even from ascending the bank and looking over.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) remained motionless, not disturbing a muscle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face or raising
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes; for were she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to turn up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face the fire on the bank would
shine upon it, and Wildeve might be looking down.

<p/>There was a second splash into the pond.

<p/>Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) stay so long without advancing and looking over? Curiosity
had its way--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) ascended one or two of the earth-steps in the bank and
glanced out.

<p/>Wildeve was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had come forward after throwing the last
pebble, and the fire now shone into each of their faces from the bank
stretching breast-high between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not light it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div>cried Eustacia quickly. <div class="bookquote">``It was lit without my
knowledge. Don't, don't come over to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why have you been living here all these days without telling me? You
have left your home. I fear I am something to blame in this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not let in his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mother; that's how it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not deserve what you have got, Eustacia; you are in great
misery; I see it in your eyes, your mouth, and all over you. My poor,
poor girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) stepped over the bank. <div class="bookquote">``You are beyond everything
unhappy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; not exactly--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been pushed too far--it is killing you--I do think it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) usually quiet breathing had grown quicker with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) words. <div class="bookquote">``I--I--''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) began, and then burst into quivering sobs, shaken to the very heart
by the unexpected voice of pity--a sentiment whose existence in relation
to herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had almost forgotten.

<p/>This outbreak of weeping took Eustacia herself so much by surprise that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could not leave off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) turned aside from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) in some shame,
though turning hid nothing from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sobbed on desperately; then
the outpour lessened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) became quieter. Wildeve had resisted the
impulse to clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and stood without speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you not ashamed of me, who used never to be a crying animal?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
asked in a weak whisper as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you go away?
I wish you had not seen quite all that; it reveals too much by half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have wished it, because it makes me as sad as you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said
with emotion and deference. <div class="bookquote">``As for revealing--the word is impossible
between us two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not send for you--don't forget it, Damon; I am in pain, but I did
not send for you! As a wife, at least, I've been straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind--I came. O, Eustacia, forgive me for the harm I have done
you in these two past years! I see more and more that I have been your
ruin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not you. This place I live in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, your generosity may naturally make you say that. But I am the
culprit. I should either have done more or nothing at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought never to have hunted you out, or, having done it, I ought to
have persisted in retaining you. But of course I have no right to talk
of that now. I will only ask this--can I do anything for you? Is there
anything on the face of the earth that a man can do to make you happier
than you are at present? If there is, I will do it. You may command
me, Eustacia, to the limit of my influence; and don't forget that I am
richer now. Surely something can be done to save you from this! Such
a rare plant in such a wild place it grieves me to see. Do you want
anything bought? Do you want to go anywhere? Do you want to escape the
place altogether? Only say it, and I'll do anything to put an end to
those tears, which but for me would never have been at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are each married to another person,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said faintly; <div class="bookquote">``and
assistance from you would have an evil sound--after--after--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's no preventing slanderers from having their fill at any
time; but you need not be afraid. Whatever I may feel I promise you on
my word of honour never to speak to you about--or act upon--until you
say I may. I know my duty to Thomasin quite as well as I know my duty to
you as a woman unfairly treated. What shall I assist you in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In getting away from here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you wish to go to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a place in my mind. If you could help me as far as Budmouth I
can do all the rest. Steamers sail from there across the Channel, and
so I can get to Paris, where I want to be. Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) pleaded earnestly,
<div class="bookquote">``help me to get to Budmouth harbour without my grandfather's or my
husband's knowledge, and I can do all the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be safe to leave you there alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. I know Budmouth well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I go with you? I am rich now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say yes, sweet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was silent still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let me know when you wish to go. We shall be at our present
house till December; after that we remove to Casterbridge. Command me in
anything till that time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will think of this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``Whether I can honestly make
use of you as a friend, or must close with you as a lover--that is what
I must ask myself. If I wish to go and decide to accept your company I
will signal to you some evening at eight o’clock punctually, and this
will mean that you are to be ready with a horse and trap at twelve
o’clock the same night to drive me to Budmouth harbour in time for the
morning boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will look out every night at eight, and no signal shall escape me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now please go away. If I decide on this escape I can only meet you
once more unless--I cannot go without you. Go--I cannot bear it longer.
Go--go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve slowly went up the steps and descended into the darkness on the
other side; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) walked he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) glanced back, till the bank blotted out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) form from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) further view.




<p/>6--Thomasin Argues with Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) Cousin, and He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) Writes a Letter


<p/>Yeobright was at this time at Blooms-End, hoping that Eustacia would
return to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). The removal of furniture had been accomplished only that
day, though Clym had lived in the old house for more than a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had
spent the time in working about the premises, sweeping leaves from the
garden paths, cutting dead stalks from the flower beds, and nailing
up creepers which had been displaced by the autumn winds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) took no
particular pleasure in these deeds, but they formed a screen between
himself and despair. Moreover, it had become a religion with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) to
preserve in good condition all that had lapsed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mother's hands
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) own.

<p/>During these operations he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was constantly on the watch for Eustacia.
That there should be no mistake about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knowing where to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had ordered a notice board to be affixed to the garden gate at
Alderworth, signifying in white letters whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had removed. When a
leaf floated to the earth he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) head, thinking it might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
foot-fall. A bird searching for worms in the mould of the flower-beds
sounded like her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand on the latch of the gate; and at dusk, when soft,
strange ventriloquisms came from holes in the ground, hollow stalks,
curled dead leaves, and other crannies wherein breezes, worms, and
insects can work their will, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) fancied that they were Eustacia,
standing without and breathing wishes of reconciliation.

<p/>Up to this hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had persevered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) resolve not to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) back.
At the same time the severity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lulled
the sharpness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) regret for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mother, and awoke some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) old
solicitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) mother's supplanter. Harsh feelings produce harsh
usage, and this by reaction quenches the sentiments that gave it birth.
The more he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) reflected the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) softened. But to look upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife
as innocence in distress was impossible, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) could ask himself
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) quite time enough--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had not come a little
too suddenly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) on that sombre morning.

<p/>Now that the first flush of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) anger had paled he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was disinclined to
ascribe to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) more than an indiscreet friendship with Wildeve, for
there had not appeared in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) manner the signs of dishonour. And this
once admitted, an absolutely dark interpretation of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) act towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
mother was no longer forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>).

<p/>On the evening of the fifth November his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) thoughts of Eustacia were
intense. Echoes from those past times when they had exchanged tender
words all the day long came like the diffused murmur of a seashore left
miles behind. <div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might have brought herself to
communicate with me before now, and confess honestly what Wildeve was to
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of remaining at home that night he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) determined to go and see
Thomasin and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) found opportunity he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would allude to the
cause of the separation between Eustacia and himself, keeping silence,
however, on the fact that there was a third person in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) house when his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
mother was turned away. If it proved that Wildeve was innocently there
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would doubtless openly mention it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) were there with unjust
intentions Wildeve, being a man of quick feeling, might possibly say
something to reveal the extent to which Eustacia was compromised.

<p/>But on reaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) cousin's house he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) found that only Thomasin was
at home, Wildeve being at that time on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) way towards the bonfire
innocently lit by Charley at Mistover. Thomasin then, as always, was
glad to see Clym, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) to inspect the sleeping baby, carefully
screening the candlelight from the infant's eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tamsin, have you heard that Eustacia is not with me now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said when
they had sat down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin, alarmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And not that I have left Alderworth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I never hear tidings from Alderworth unless you bring them. What is
the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Susan/Susan Nunsuch</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym in a disturbed voice related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) visit to Susan Nunsuch's
boy, the revelation he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had made, and what had resulted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
charging Eustacia with having wilfully and heartlessly done the deed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
suppressed all mention of Wildeve's presence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All this, and I not knowing it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>murmured Thomasin in an awestruck
tone, <div class="bookquote">``Terrible! What could have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)--O, Eustacia! And when you
found it out you went in hot haste to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)? Were you too cruel?--or is
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) really so wicked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) seems?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can a man be too cruel to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's enemy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can fancy so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then--I'll admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can. But now what is to be done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make it up again--if a quarrel so deadly can ever be made up. I almost
wish you had not told me. But do try to be reconciled. There are ways,
after all, if you both wish to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that we do both wish to make it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had wished it, would she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not have sent to me by this time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to wish to, and yet you have not sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True; but I have been tossed to and fro in doubt if I ought, after such
strong provocation. To see me now, Thomasin, gives you no idea of what I
have been; of what depths I have descended to in these few last days. O,
it was a bitter shame to shut out my mother like that! Can I ever forget
it, or even agree to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might not have known that anything serious would come of it, and
perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not mean to keep Aunt out altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not. But the fact remains that keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
out she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sorry, and send for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will not come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will prove her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) guilty, by showing that it is her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) habit to nourish
enmity. But I do not think that for a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do this. I will wait for a day or two longer--not longer than
two days certainly; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not send to me in that time I will
indeed send to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I thought to have seen Wildeve here tonight. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
from home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin blushed a little. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is merely gone out for a
walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) take you with him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? The evening is fine. You want fresh
air as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't care for going anywhere; besides, there is baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. Well, I have been thinking whether I should not consult your
husband about this as well as you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym steadily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy I would not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) quickly answered. <div class="bookquote">``It can do no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cousin looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in the face. No doubt Thomasin was ignorant that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband had any share in the events of that tragic afternoon; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) countenance seemed to signify that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) concealed some suspicion or
thought of the reputed tender relations between Wildeve and Eustacia in
days gone by.

<p/>Clym, however, could make nothing of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rose to depart, more in
doubt than when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will write to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in a day or two?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman earnestly.
<div class="bookquote">``I do so hope the wretched separation may come to an end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym; <div class="bookquote">``I don't rejoice in my present state at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and climbed over the hill to Blooms-End. Before going to
bed he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat down and wrote the following letter:--


<p/>MY DEAR EUSTACIA,--I must obey my heart without consulting my reason too
closely. Will you come back to me? Do so, and the past shall never be
mentioned. I was too severe; but O, Eustacia, the provocation! You don't
know, you never will know, what those words of anger cost me which
you drew down upon yourself. All that an honest man can promise you I
promise now, which is that from me you shall never suffer anything on
this score again. After all the vows we have made, Eustacia, I think we
had better pass the remainder of our lives in trying to keep them. Come
to me, then, even if you reproach me. I have thought of your sufferings
that morning on which I parted from you; I know they were genuine, and
they are as much as you ought to bear. Our love must still continue.
Such hearts as ours would never have been given us but to be concerned
with each other. I could not ask you back at first, Eustacia, for I was
unable to persuade myself that he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) who was with you was not there as a
lover. But if you will come and explain distracting appearances I do
not question that you can show your honesty to me. Why have you not
come before? Do you think I will not listen to you? Surely not, when you
remember the kisses and vows we exchanged under the summer moon. Return
then, and you shall be warmly welcomed. I can no longer think of you
to your prejudice--I am but too much absorbed in justifying you.--Your
husband as ever,

<p/>CLYM.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) laid it in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) desk, <div class="bookquote">``that's a good thing done.
If she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does not come before tomorrow night I will send it to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile, at the house he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had just left Thomasin sat sighing uneasily.
Fidelity to her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) husband had that evening induced her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to conceal all
suspicion that Wildeve's interest in Eustacia had not ended with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) marriage. But she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew nothing positive; and though Clym was her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
well-beloved cousin there was one nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) still.

<p/>When, a little later, Wildeve returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) walk to Mistover,
Thomasin said, <div class="bookquote">``Damon, where have you been? I was getting quite
frightened, and thought you had fallen into the river. I dislike being
in the house by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frightened?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said, touching her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cheek as if she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were some domestic
animal. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I thought nothing could frighten you. It is that you are
getting proud, I am sure, and don't like living here since we have risen
above our business. Well, it is a tedious matter, this getting a new
house; but I couldn't have set about it sooner, unless our ten thousand
pounds had been a hundred thousand, when we could have afforded to
despise caution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I don't mind waiting--I would rather stay here twelve months longer
than run any risk with baby. But I don't like your vanishing so in the
evenings. There's something on your mind--I know there is, Damon. You go
about so gloomily, and look at the heath as if it were somebody's gaol
instead of a nice wild place to walk in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) looked towards her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with pitying surprise. <div class="bookquote">``What, do you like Egdon
Heath?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like what I was born near to; I admire its grim old face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, my dear. You don't know what you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I do. There's only one thing unpleasant about Egdon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never take me with you when you walk there. Why do you wander so
much in it yourself if you so dislike it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The inquiry, though a simple one, was plainly disconcerting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) sat
down before replying. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you often see me there. Give an
instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered triumphantly. <div class="bookquote">``When you went out this evening I
thought that as baby was asleep I would see where you were going to so
mysteriously without telling me. So I ran out and followed behind you.
You stopped at the place where the road forks, looked round at the
bonfires, and then said, `Damn it, I'll go!' And you went quickly up the
left-hand road. Then I stood and watched you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve frowned, afterwards saying, with a forced smile, <div class="bookquote">``Well, what
wonderful discovery did you make?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There--now you are angry, and we won't talk of this any more.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went
across to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), sat on a footstool, and looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that's how you always back out. We will go on
with it now we have begun. What did you next see? I particularly want to
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be like that, Damon!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't see anything. You
vanished out of sight, and then I looked round at the bonfires and came
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps this is not the only time you have dogged my steps. Are you
trying to find out something bad about me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all! I have never done such a thing before, and I shouldn't have
done it now if words had not sometimes been dropped about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What DO you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) impatiently asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say--they say you used to go to Alderworth in the evenings, and it
puts into my mind what I have heard about--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>Wildeve turned angrily and stood up in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said,
flourishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hand in the air, <div class="bookquote">``just out with it, madam! I demand to
know what remarks you have heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I heard that you used to be very fond of Eustacia--nothing more
than that, though dropped in a bit-by-bit way. You ought not to be
angry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) observed that her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes were brimming with tears. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``there is nothing new in that, and of course I don't mean to be rough
towards you, so you need not cry. Now, don't let us speak of the subject
any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And no more was said, Thomasin being glad enough of a reason for not
mentioning Clym's visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that evening, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) story.




<p/>7--The Night of the Sixth of November


<p/>Having resolved on flight Eustacia at times seemed anxious that
something should happen to thwart her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own intention. The only event that
could really change her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) position was the appearance of Clym. The glory
which had encircled him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lover was departed now; yet some good
simple quality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would occasionally return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) memory and stir a
momentary throb of hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would again present himself before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).
But calmly considered it was not likely that such a severance as now
existed would ever close up--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would have to live on as a painful
object, isolated, and out of place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had used to think of the heath
alone as an uncongenial spot to be in; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) felt it now of the whole
world.

<p/>Towards evening on the sixth her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) determination to go away again revived.
About four o’clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) packed up anew the few small articles she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had
brought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) flight from Alderworth, and also some belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
which had been left here; the whole formed a bundle not too large to be
carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand for a distance of a mile or two. The scene without
grew darker; mud-coloured clouds bellied downwards from the sky like
vast hammocks slung across it, and with the increase of night a stormy
wind arose; but as yet there was no rain.

<p/>Eustacia could not rest indoors, having nothing more to do, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
wandered to and fro on the hill, not far from the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was soon
to leave. In these desultory ramblings she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) passed the cottage of Susan
Nunsuch, a little lower down than her (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) grandfather's. The door was
ajar, and a riband of bright firelight fell over the ground without. As
Eustacia crossed the firebeams she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) appeared for an instant as distinct
as a figure in a phantasmagoria--a creature of light surrounded by
an area of darkness; the moment passed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was absorbed in night
again.

<p/>A woman who was sitting inside the cottage had seen and recognized
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in that momentary irradiation. This was Susan herself, occupied
in preparing a posset for her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) little boy, who, often ailing, was
now seriously unwell. Susan dropped the spoon, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) fist at the
vanished figure, and then proceeded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) work in a musing, absent
way.

<p/>At eight o’clock, the hour at which Eustacia had promised to signal
Wildeve if ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) signalled at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) looked around the premises to
learn if the coast was clear, went to the furze-rick, and pulled thence
a long-stemmed bough of that fuel. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) carried to the corner of the
bank, and, glancing behind to see if the shutters were all closed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
struck a light, and kindled the furze. When it was thoroughly ablaze
Eustacia took it by the stem and waved it in the air above her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head till
it had burned itself out.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was gratified, if gratification were possible to such a mood, by
seeing a similar light in the vicinity of Wildeve's residence a minute
or two later. Having agreed to keep watch at this hour every night, in
case she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) should require assistance, this promptness proved how strictly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had held to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) word. Four hours after the present time, that is, at
midnight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was to be ready to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to Budmouth, as prearranged.

<p/>Eustacia returned to the house. Supper having been got over she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) retired
early, and sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bedroom waiting for the time to go by. The night
being dark and threatening, Captain Vye had not strolled out to gossip
in any cottage or to call at the inn, as was sometimes his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) custom on
these long autumn nights; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sat sipping grog alone downstairs.
About ten o’clock there was a knock at the door. When the servant opened
it the rays of the candle fell upon the form of Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was a-forced to go to Lower Mistover tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and Mr.
Yeobright asked me to leave this here on my way; but, faith, I put it in
the lining of my hat, and thought no more about it till I got back and
was hasping my gate before going to bed. So I have run back with it at
once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) handed in a letter and went his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) way. The girl brought it to the
captain, who found that it was directed to Eustacia. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) turned it over
and over, and fancied that the writing was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband's, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
could not be sure. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) decided to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) have it at once if
possible, and took it upstairs for that purpose; but on reaching the
door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) room and looking in at the keyhole he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found there was no
light within, the fact being that Eustacia, without undressing, had
flung herself upon the bed, to rest and gather a little strength for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
coming journey. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) grandfather concluded from what he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) ought
not to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); and descending again to the parlour he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) placed the
letter on the mantelpiece to give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in the morning.

<p/>At eleven o’clock he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) went to bed himself, smoked for some time in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
bedroom, put out his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) light at half-past eleven, and then, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
invariable custom, pulled up the blind before getting into bed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
might see which way the wind blew on opening his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) eyes in the morning,
his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) bedroom window commanding a view of the flagstaff and vane. Just as
he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had lain down he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was surprised to observe the white pole of the staff
flash into existence like a streak of phosphorus drawn downwards across
the shade of night without. Only one explanation met this--a light had
been suddenly thrown upon the pole from the direction of the house. As
everybody had retired to rest the old man felt it necessary to get
out of bed, open the window softly, and look to the right and left.
Eustacia's bedroom was lighted up, and it was the shine from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) window
which had lighted the pole. Wondering what had aroused her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained
undecided at the window, and was thinking of fetching the letter to slip
it under her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) door, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard a slight brushing of garments on the
partition dividing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room from the passage.

<p/>The captain concluded that Eustacia, feeling wakeful, had gone for a
book, and would have dismissed the matter as unimportant if he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had not
also heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) distinctly weeping as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is thinking of that husband of hers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) said to himself. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, the
silly goose! she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had no business to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). I wonder if that letter
is really his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) arose, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) boat-cloak round him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), opened the door, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Eustacia!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>There was no answer. <div class="bookquote">``Eustacia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) repeated louder, <div class="bookquote">``there
is a letter on the mantelpiece for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But no response was made to this statement save an imaginary one from
the wind, which seemed to gnaw at the corners of the house, and the
stroke of a few drops of rain upon the windows.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) went on to the landing, and stood waiting nearly five minutes. Still
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not return. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) went back for a light, and prepared to follow
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); but first he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bedroom. There, on the outside of the
quilt, was the impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) form, showing that the bed had not
been opened; and, what was more significant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had not taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
candlestick downstairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was now thoroughly alarmed; and hastily
putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) clothes he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) descended to the front door, which he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) himself
had bolted and locked. It was now unfastened. There was no longer
any doubt that Eustacia had left the house at this midnight hour; and
whither could she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) have gone? To follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was almost impossible. Had
the dwelling stood in an ordinary road, two persons setting out, one
in each direction, might have made sure of overtaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); but it was
a hopeless task to seek for anybody on a heath in the dark, the
practicable directions for flight across it from any point being as
numerous as the meridians radiating from the pole. Perplexed what to do,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) looked into the parlour, and was vexed to find that the letter still
lay there untouched.


<p/>At half-past eleven, finding that the house was silent, Eustacia had
lighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) candle, put on some warm outer wrappings, taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) bag in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hand, and, extinguishing the light again, descended the staircase.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) got into the outer air she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) found that it had begun to rain, and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stood pausing at the door it increased, threatening to come on
heavily. But having committed herself to this line of action there was
no retreating for bad weather. Even the receipt of Clym's letter would
not have stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) now. The gloom of the night was funereal; all
nature seemed clothed in crape. The spiky points of the fir trees behind
the house rose into the sky like the turrets and pinnacles of an abbey.
Nothing below the horizon was visible save a light which was still
burning in the cottage of Susan Nunsuch.

<p/>Eustacia opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) umbrella and went out from the enclosure by the
steps over the bank, after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was beyond all danger of being
perceived. Skirting the pool, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) followed the path towards Rainbarrow,
occasionally stumbling over twisted furze roots, tufts of rushes, or
oozing lumps of fleshy fungi, which at this season lay scattered about
the heath like the rotten liver and lungs of some colossal animal.
The moon and stars were closed up by cloud and rain to the degree
of extinction. It was a night which led the traveller's thoughts
instinctively to dwell on nocturnal scenes of disaster in the
chronicles of the world, on all that is terrible and dark in history and
legend--the last plague of Egypt, the destruction of Sennacherib's host,
the agony in Gethsemane.

<p/>Eustacia at length reached Rainbarrow, and stood still there to think.
Never was harmony more perfect than that between the chaos of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind
and the chaos of the world without. A sudden recollection had flashed
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) this moment--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had not money enough for undertaking a long
journey. Amid the fluctuating sentiments of the day her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) unpractical mind
had not dwelt on the necessity of being well-provided, and now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
thoroughly realized the conditions she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sighed bitterly and ceased to
stand erect, gradually crouching down under the umbrella as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) were
drawn into the Barrow by a hand from beneath. Could it be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was
to remain a captive still? Money--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had never felt its value before.
Even to efface herself from the country means were required. To ask
Wildeve for pecuniary aid without allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was
impossible to a woman with a shadow of pride left in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); to fly as
his (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) mistress--and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--was of the nature of
humiliation.

<p/>Anyone who had stood by now would have pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), not so much on
account of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exposure to weather, and isolation from all of humanity
except the mouldered remains inside the tumulus; but for that other form
of misery which was denoted by the slightly rocking movement that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
feelings imparted to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) person. Extreme unhappiness weighed visibly
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Between the drippings of the rain from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) umbrella to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
mantle, from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mantle to the heather, from the heather to the earth,
very similar sounds could be heard coming from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips; and the
tearfulness of the outer scene was repeated upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. The wings of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul were broken by the cruel obstructiveness of all about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and
even had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seen herself in a promising way of getting to Budmouth,
entering a steamer, and sailing to some opposite port, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have
been but little more buoyant, so fearfully malignant were other things.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uttered words aloud. When a woman in such a situation, neither old,
deaf, crazed, nor whimsical, takes upon herself to sob and soliloquize
aloud there is something grievous the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I go, can I go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moaned. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s not GREAT enough for me to give
myself to--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not suffice for my desire!... If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been a Saul or
a Bonaparte--ah! But to break my marriage vow for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaparte</b></font>)--it is too poor a
luxury!... And I have no money to go alone! And if I could, what comfort
to me? I must drag on next year, as I have dragged on this year, and the
year after that as before. How I have tried and tried to be a splendid
woman, and how destiny has been against me!... I do not deserve my lot!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried in a frenzy of bitter revolt. <div class="bookquote">``O, the cruelty of putting me
into this ill-conceived world! I was capable of much; but I have been
injured and blighted and crushed by things beyond my control! O, how
hard it is of Heaven to devise such tortures for me, who have done no
harm to Heaven at all!''


 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/>The distant light which Eustacia had cursorily observed in leaving
the house came, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had divined, from the cottage window of Susan
Nunsuch. What Eustacia did not divine was the occupation of the woman
within at that moment. Susan's sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) passing figure earlier in
the evening, not five minutes after the sick boy's exclamation, <div class="bookquote">``Mother,
I do feel so bad!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>persuaded the matron that an evil influence was
certainly exercised by Eustacia's propinquity.

<p/>On this account Susan did not go to bed as soon as the evening's work
was over, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) would have done at ordinary times. To counteract the
malign spell which she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) imagined poor Eustacia to be working, the
boy's mother busied herself with a ghastly invention of superstition,
calculated to bring powerlessness, atrophy, and annihilation on any
human being against whom it was directed. It was a practice well known
on Egdon at that date, and one that is not quite extinct at the present
day.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) passed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) candle into an inner room, where, among other
utensils, were two large brown pans, containing together perhaps a
hundredweight of liquid honey, the produce of the bees during the
foregoing summer. On a shelf over the pans was a smooth and solid yellow
mass of a hemispherical form, consisting of beeswax from the same take
of honey. Susan took down the lump, and cutting off several thin
slices, heaped them in an iron ladle, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) returned to the
living-room, and placed the vessel in the hot ashes of the fireplace. As
soon as the wax had softened to the plasticity of dough she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) kneaded the
pieces together. And now her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) face became more intent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) began moulding
the wax; and it was evident from her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) manner of manipulation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was
endeavouring to give it some preconceived form. The form was human.

<p/>By warming and kneading, cutting and twisting, dismembering and
re-joining the incipient image she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had in about a quarter of an hour
produced a shape which tolerably well resembled a woman, and was
about six inches high. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laid it on the table to get cold and hard.
Meanwhile she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took the candle and went upstairs to where the little boy
was lying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you notice, my dear, what Mrs. Eustacia wore this afternoon besides
the dark dress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A red ribbon round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) neck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--except sandal-shoes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A red ribbon and sandal-shoes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said to herself.

<p/>Mrs. Nunsuch went and searched till she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) found a fragment of the
narrowest red ribbon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) took downstairs and tied round the neck
of the image. Then fetching ink and a quilt from the rickety bureau by
the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) blackened the feet of the image to the extent presumably
covered by shoes; and on the instep of each foot marked cross-lines in
the shape taken by the sandalstrings of those days. Finally she (<font color='blue'><b>Nunsuch</b></font>) tied
a bit of black thread round the upper part of the head, in faint
resemblance to a snood worn for confining the hair.

<p/>Susan held the object at arm's length and contemplated it with a
satisfaction in which there was no smile. To anybody acquainted with
the inhabitants of Egdon Heath the image would have suggested Eustacia
Yeobright.

<p/>From her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) workbasket in the window-seat the woman took a paper of pins,
of the old long and yellow sort, whose heads were disposed to come off
at their first usage. These she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to thrust into the image in all
directions, with apparently excruciating energy. Probably as many as
fifty were thus inserted, some into the head of the wax model, some into
the shoulders, some into the trunk, some upwards through the soles of
the feet, till the figure was completely permeated with pins.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned to the fire. It had been of turf; and though the high heap
of ashes which turf fires produce was somewhat dark and dead on the
outside, upon raking it abroad with the shovel the inside of the mass
showed a glow of red heat. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took a few pieces of fresh turf from the
chimney-corner and built them together over the glow, upon which the
fire brightened. Seizing with the tongs the image that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had made of
Eustacia, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held it in the heat, and watched it as it began to waste
slowly away. And while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood thus engaged there came from between
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips a murmur of words.

<p/>It was a strange jargon--the Lord's Prayer repeated backwards--the
incantation usual in proceedings for obtaining unhallowed assistance
against an enemy. Susan uttered the lugubrious discourse three times
slowly, and when it was completed the image had considerably diminished.
As the wax dropped into the fire a long flame arose from the spot,
and curling its tongue round the figure ate still further into its
substance. A pin occasionally dropped with the wax, and the embers
heated it red as it lay.




<p/>8--Rain, Darkness, and Anxious Wanderers


<p/>While the effigy of Eustacia was melting to nothing, and the fair woman
herself was standing on Rainbarrow, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul in an abyss of desolation
seldom plumbed by one so young, Yeobright sat lonely at Blooms-End.
He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had fulfilled his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) word to Thomasin by sending off Fairway with the
letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) wife, and now waited with increased impatience for some
sound or signal of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) return. Were Eustacia still at Mistover the very
least he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) expected was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would send him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) back a reply tonight by
the same hand; though, to leave all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) inclination, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had cautioned
Fairway not to ask for an answer. If one were handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was
to bring it immediately; if not, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was to go straight home without
troubling to come round to Blooms-End again that night.

<p/>But secretly Clym had a more pleasing hope. Eustacia might possibly
decline to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) pen--it was rather her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) way to work silently--and
surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) by appearing at his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) door. How fully her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind was made up to
do otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) did not know.

<p/>To Clym's regret it began to rain and blow hard as the evening advanced.
The wind rasped and scraped at the corners of the house, and filliped
the eavesdroppings like peas against the panes. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) walked restlessly
about the untenanted rooms, stopping strange noises in windows and
doors by jamming splinters of wood into the casements and crevices,
and pressing together the leadwork of the quarries where it had become
loosened from the glass. It was one of those nights when cracks in the
walls of old churches widen, when ancient stains on the ceilings of
decayed manor houses are renewed and enlarged from the size of a man's
hand to an area of many feet. The little gate in the palings before
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dwelling continually opened and clicked together again, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked out eagerly nobody was there; it was as if invisible shapes of
the dead were passing in on their way to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Between ten and eleven o’clock, finding that neither Fairway nor anybody
else came to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) retired to rest, and despite his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anxieties soon
fell asleep. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep, however, was not very sound, by reason of the
expectancy he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given way to, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was easily awakened by a knocking
which began at the door about an hour after. Clym arose and looked out
of the window. Rain was still falling heavily, the whole expanse of
heath before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emitting a subdued hiss under the downpour. It was too
dark to see anything at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried.

<p/>Light footsteps shifted their position in the porch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could just
distinguish in a plaintive female voice the words, <div class="bookquote">``O Clym, come down
and let me in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flushed hot with agitation. <div class="bookquote">``Surely it is Eustacia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murmured. If
so, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had indeed come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unawares.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hastily got a light, dressed himself, and went down. On his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flinging
open the door the rays of the candle fell upon a woman closely wrapped
up, who at once came forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomasin!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed in an indescribable tone of disappointment. <div class="bookquote">``It
is Thomasin, and on such a night as this! O, where is Eustacia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin it was, wet, frightened, and panting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eustacia? I don't know, Clym; but I can think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said with much
perturbation. <div class="bookquote">``Let me come in and rest--I will explain this. There is a
great trouble brewing--my husband and Eustacia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think my husband is going to leave me or do something dreadful--I
don't know what--Clym, will you go and see? I have nobody to help me but
you; Eustacia has not yet come home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on breathlessly: <div class="bookquote">``Then they are going to run off together! He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
came indoors tonight about eight o’clock and said in an off-hand way,
`Tamsie, I have just found that I must go a journey.' `When?' I
said. `Tonight,' he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said. `Where?' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). `I cannot tell you at
present,' he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said; `I shall be back again tomorrow.' He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) then went and
busied himself in looking up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) things, and took no notice of me at
all. I expected to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) start, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not, and then it came to
be ten o’clock, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, `You had better go to bed.' I didn't know
what to do, and I went to bed. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought I fell asleep, for
half an hour after that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came up and unlocked the oak chest we keep
money in when we have much in the house and took out a roll of something
which I believe was banknotes, though I was not aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had `em
there. These he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must have got from the bank when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went there the other
day. What does he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) want banknotes for, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is only going off for a day?
When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had gone down I thought of Eustacia, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had met her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) the
night before--I know he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did meet her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), Clym, for I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) part of
the way; but I did not like to tell you when you called, and so make you
think ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as I did not think it was so serious. Then I could not
stay in bed; I got up and dressed myself, and when I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) out in
the stable I thought I would come and tell you. So I came downstairs
without any noise and slipped out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not absolutely gone when you left?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Will you, dear Cousin Clym, go and try to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) not to go?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) takes no notice of what I say, and puts me off with the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>)
going on a journey, and will be home tomorrow, and all that; but I don't
believe it. I think you could influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``O, Eustacia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms a large bundle; and having by this time
seated herself she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to unroll it, when a baby appeared as the
kernel to the husks--dry, warm, and unconscious of travel or rough
weather. Thomasin briefly kissed the baby, and then found time to begin
crying as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I brought baby, for I was afraid what might happen
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). I suppose it will be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) death, but I couldn't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) with
Rachel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym hastily put together the logs on the hearth, raked abroad the
embers, which were scarcely yet extinct, and blew up a flame with the
bellows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dry yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go and get some more wood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no--don't stay for that. I'll make up the fire. Will you go at
once--please will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright ran upstairs to finish dressing himself. While he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gone
another rapping came to the door. This time there was no delusion that
it might be Eustacia's--the footsteps just preceding it had been heavy
and slow. Yeobright thinking it might possibly be Fairway with a note in
answer, descended again and opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Vye?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said to a dripping figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is my granddaughter here?''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then where is she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>)?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you ought to know--you are her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only in name apparently,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym with rising excitement. <div class="bookquote">``I believe
she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) means to elope tonight with Wildeve. I am just going to look to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) has left my house; she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) left about half an hour ago. Who's
sitting there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My cousin Thomasin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div><p/>The captain bowed in a preoccupied way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I only hope it is no
worse than an elopement,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse? What's worse than the worst a wife can do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have been told a strange tale. Before starting in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
I called up Charley, my stable lad. I missed my pistols the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pistols?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) said at the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) took them down to clean. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) has now owned
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) took them because he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) saw Eustacia looking curiously at them; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) afterwards owned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was thinking of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) life,
but bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) to secrecy, and promised never to think of such a thing
again. I hardly suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) will ever have bravado enough to use one
of them; but it shows what has been lurking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind; and people who
think of that sort of thing once think of it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are the pistols?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Safely locked up. O no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) won't touch them again. But there are
more ways of letting out life than through a bullet-hole. What did you
quarrel about so bitterly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to all this? You must
have treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) badly indeed. Well, I was always against the marriage,
and I was right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright, paying no attention to the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Wildeve's--that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) destination, depend upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin here broke in, still weeping: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was only going on a
sudden short journey; but if so why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) want so much money? O, Clym,
what do you think will happen? I am afraid that you, my poor baby, will
soon have no father left to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am off now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright, stepping into the porch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would fain go with `ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man doubtfully. <div class="bookquote">``But I begin to
be afraid that my legs will hardly carry me there such a night as this.
I am not so young as I was. If they are interrupted in their flight
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) will be sure to come back to me, and I ought to be at the house to
receive her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). But be it as `twill I can't walk to the Quiet Woman, and
that's an end on't. I'll go straight home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will perhaps be best,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``Thomasin, dry yourself, and be as
comfortable as you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) closed the door upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and left the house in company
with Captain Vye, who parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) outside the gate, taking the
middle path, which led to Mistover. Clym crossed by the right-hand track
towards the inn.

<p/>Thomasin, being left alone, took off some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) wet garments, carried
the baby upstairs to Clym's bed, and then came down to the sitting-room
again, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) made a larger fire, and began drying herself. The fire
soon flared up the chimney, giving the room an appearance of comfort
that was doubled by contrast with the drumming of the storm without,
which snapped at the windowpanes and breathed into the chimney strange
low utterances that seemed to be the prologue to some tragedy.

<p/>But the least part of Thomasin was in the house, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) heart being at
ease about the little girl upstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was mentally following Clym on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) journey. Having indulged in this imaginary peregrination for
some considerable interval, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) became impressed with a sense of the
intolerable slowness of time. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) sat on. The moment then came when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could scarcely sit longer, and it was like a satire on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) patience
to remember that Clym could hardly have reached the inn as yet. At last
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went to the baby's bedside. The child was sleeping soundly; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
imagination of possibly disastrous events at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) home, the predominance
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) of the unseen over the seen, agitated her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) beyond endurance.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could not refrain from going down and opening the door. The rain
still continued, the candlelight falling upon the nearest drops and
making glistening darts of them as they descended across the throng of
invisible ones behind. To plunge into that medium was to plunge into
water slightly diluted with air. But the difficulty of returning to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) house at this moment made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) all the more desirous of doing
so--anything was better than suspense. <div class="bookquote">``I have come here well enough,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and why shouldn't I go back again? It is a mistake for me to
be away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hastily fetched the infant, wrapped it up, cloaked herself as
before, and shoveling the ashes over the fire, to prevent accidents,
went into the open air. Pausing first to put the door key in its
old place behind the shutter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) resolutely turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face to the
confronting pile of firmamental darkness beyond the palings, and stepped
into its midst. But Thomasin's imagination being so actively engaged
elsewhere, the night and the weather had for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) no terror beyond that
of their actual discomfort and difficulty.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was soon ascending Blooms-End valley and traversing the undulations
on the side of the hill. The noise of the wind over the heath was
shrill, and as if it whistled for joy at finding a night so congenial as
this. Sometimes the path led her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to hollows between thickets of tall
and dripping bracken, dead, though not yet prostrate, which enclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
like a pool. When they were more than usually tall she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lifted the baby
to the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) head, that it might be out of the reach of their
drenching fronds. On higher ground, where the wind was brisk and
sustained, the rain flew in a level flight without sensible descent, so
that it was beyond all power to imagine the remoteness of the point
at which it left the bosoms of the clouds. Here self-defence was
impossible, and individual drops stuck into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) like the arrows into
Saint Sebastian. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was enabled to avoid puddles by the nebulous
paleness which signified their presence, though beside anything less
dark than the heath they themselves would have appeared as blackness.

<p/>Yet in spite of all this Thomasin was not sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had started.
To her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) there were not, as to Eustacia, demons in the air, and malice
in every bush and bough. The drops which lashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face were not
scorpions, but prosy rain; Egdon in the mass was no monster whatever,
but impersonal open ground. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) fears of the place were rational, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
dislikes of its worst moods reasonable. At this time it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) view
a windy, wet place, in which a person might experience much discomfort,
lose the path without care, and possibly catch cold.

<p/>If the path is well known the difficulty at such times of keeping
therein is not altogether great, from its familiar feel to the feet; but
once lost it is irrecoverable. Owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) baby, who somewhat impeded
Thomasin's view forward and distracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did at last lose
the track. This mishap occurred when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was descending an open slope
about two-thirds home. Instead of attempting, by wandering hither and
thither, the hopeless task of finding such a mere thread, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) went
straight on, trusting for guidance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) general knowledge of the
contours, which was scarcely surpassed by Clym's or by that of the
heath-croppers themselves.

<p/>At length Thomasin reached a hollow and began to discern through the
rain a faint blotted radiance, which presently assumed the oblong form
of an open door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew that no house stood hereabouts, and was soon
aware of the nature of the door by its height above the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it is Diggory Venn's van, surely!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said.

<p/>A certain secluded spot near Rainbarrow was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) knew, often Venn's
chosen centre when staying in this neighbourhood; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) guessed at
once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had stumbled upon this mysterious retreat. The question
arose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) mind whether or not she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) should ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) to guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) into
the path. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) anxiety to reach home she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) would appeal
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>), notwithstanding the strangeness of appearing before his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) eyes at
this place and season. But when, in pursuance of this resolve, Thomasin
reached the van and looked in she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) found it to be untenanted; though
there was no doubt that it was the reddleman's. The fire was burning in
the stove, the lantern hung from the nail. Round the doorway the floor
was merely sprinkled with rain, and not saturated, which told her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) that
the door had not long been opened.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) stood uncertainly looking in Thomasin heard a footstep
advancing from the darkness behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), and turning, beheld the
well-known form in corduroy, lurid from head to foot, the lantern beams
falling upon him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) through an intervening gauze of raindrops.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you went down the slope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) said, without noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``How do you come back here again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Diggory?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn, still unperceiving. <div class="bookquote">``And why were you crying
so just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Diggory! don't you know me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But of course you don't,
wrapped up like this. What do you mean? I have not been crying here, and
I have not been here before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn then came nearer till he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) could see the illuminated side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
form.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Wildeve!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) exclaimed, starting. <div class="bookquote">``What a time for us to meet!
And the baby too! What dreadful thing can have brought you out on such a
night as this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) could not immediately answer; and without asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) permission he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
hopped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) van, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) by the arm, and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) up after him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) continued when they stood within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have lost my way coming from Blooms-End, and I am in a great hurry to
get home. Please show me as quickly as you can! It is so silly of me not
to know Egdon better, and I cannot think how I came to lose the path.
Show me quickly, Diggory, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course. I will go with `ee. But you came to me before this,
Mrs. Wildeve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only came this minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's strange. I was lying down here asleep about five minutes ago,
with the door shut to keep out the weather, when the brushing of a
woman's clothes over the heath-bushes just outside woke me up, for I
don't sleep heavy, and at the same time I heard a sobbing or crying from
the same woman. I opened my door and held out my lantern, and just as
far as the light would reach I saw a woman; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head when
the light sheened on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and then hurried on downhill. I hung up the
lantern, and was curious enough to pull on my things and dog her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a few
steps, but I could see nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) any more. That was where I had
been when you came up; and when I saw you I thought you were the same
one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it was one of the heathfolk going home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it couldn't be. `Tis too late. The noise of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gown over the he (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>)'th
was of a whistling sort that nothing but silk will make.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't I, then. My dress is not silk, you see... Are we anywhere in
a line between Mistover and the inn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; not far out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I wonder if it was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! Diggory, I must go at once!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) jumped down from the van before he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) was aware, when Venn unhooked the
lantern and leaped down after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'll take the baby, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``You must be tired out by the weight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin hesitated a moment, and then delivered the baby into Venn's
hands. <div class="bookquote">``Don't squeeze her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), Diggory,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little arm;
and keep the cloak close over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) like this, so that the rain may not
drop in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``As if I could hurt anything belonging to
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only meant accidentally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The baby is dry enough, but you are pretty wet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div>said the reddleman
when, in closing the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) cart to padlock it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) noticed on the
floor a ring of water drops where her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) cloak had hung from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>Thomasin followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) wound right and left to avoid the larger
bushes, stopping occasionally and covering the lantern, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) looked
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) shoulder to gain some idea of the position of Rainbarrow above
them, which it was necessary to keep directly behind their backs to
preserve a proper course.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure the rain does not fall upon baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite sure. May I ask how old he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) is, ma’am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``Anybody can see better than that in
a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is nearly two months old. How far is it now to the inn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little over a quarter of a mile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you walk a little faster?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you could not keep up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very anxious to get there. Ah, there is a light from the window!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis not from the window. That's a gig-lamp, to the best of my belief.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin in despair. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had been there sooner--give me
the baby, Diggory--you can go back now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go all the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn. <div class="bookquote">``There is a quag between us and
that light, and you will walk into it up to your neck unless I take you
round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the light is at the inn, and there is no quag in front of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, the light is below the inn some two or three hundred yards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``Go towards the light, and not
towards the inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Venn, swerving round in obedience; and, after a pause,
<div class="bookquote">``I wish you would tell me what this great trouble is. I think you have
proved that I can be trusted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are some things that cannot be--cannot be told to--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
heart rose into her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) throat, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could say no more.




<p/>9--Sights and Sounds Draw the Wanderers Together


<p/>Having seen Eustacia's signal from the hill at eight o’clock, Wildeve
immediately prepared to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) flight, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hoped,
accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was somewhat perturbed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) manner of informing
Thomasin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was going on a journey was in itself sufficient to
rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) suspicions. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had gone to bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) collected the few
articles he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would require, and went upstairs to the money-chest, whence
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) took a tolerably bountiful sum in notes, which had been advanced
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) on the property he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was so soon to have in possession, to defray
expenses incidental to the removal.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) then went to the stable and coach-house to assure himself that the
horse, gig, and harness were in a fit condition for a long drive. Nearly
half an hour was spent thus, and on returning to the house Wildeve had
no thought of Thomasin being anywhere but in bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had told the stable
lad not to stay up, leading the boy to understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) departure
would be at three or four in the morning; for this, though an
exceptional hour, was less strange than midnight, the time actually
agreed on, the packet from Budmouth sailing between one and two.

<p/>At last all was quiet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had nothing to do but to wait. By no
effort could he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) shake off the oppression of spirits which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had
experienced ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) last meeting with Eustacia, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) hoped
there was that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) situation which money could cure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had persuaded
himself that to act not ungenerously towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) gentle wife by settling
on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) property, and with chivalrous devotion towards
another and greater woman by sharing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fate, was possible. And though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) meant to adhere to Eustacia's instructions to the letter, to deposit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) wished and to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), should that be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) will, the
spell that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had cast over him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) intensified, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) heart was beating
fast in the anticipated futility of such commands in the face of a
mutual wish that they should throw in their lot together.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) would not allow himself to dwell long upon these conjectures, maxims,
and hopes, and at twenty minutes to twelve he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) again went softly to the
stable, harnessed the horse, and lit the lamps; whence, taking the horse
by the head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) with the covered car out of the yard to a spot
by the roadside some quarter of a mile below the inn.

<p/>Here Wildeve waited, slightly sheltered from the driving rain by a high
bank that had been cast up at this place. Along the surface of the road
where lit by the lamps the loosened gravel and small stones scudded and
clicked together before the wind, which, leaving them in heaps, plunged
into the heath and boomed across the bushes into darkness. Only one
sound rose above this din of weather, and that was the roaring of a
ten-hatch weir to the southward, from a river in the meads which formed
the boundary of the heath in this direction.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lingered on in perfect stillness till he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) began to fancy that the
midnight hour must have struck. A very strong doubt had arisen in
his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mind if Eustacia would venture down the hill in such weather; yet
knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) nature he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) might. <div class="bookquote">``Poor thing! `tis like her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
ill-luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) turned to the lamp and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) watch. To his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) surprise
it was nearly a quarter past midnight. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) now wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had driven
up the circuitous road to Mistover, a plan not adopted because of the
enormous length of the route in proportion to that of the pedestrian's
path down the open hillside, and the consequent increase of labour for
the horse.

<p/>At this moment a footstep approached; but the light of the lamps being
in a different direction the comer was not visible. The step paused,
then came on again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eustacia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve.

<p/>The person came forward, and the light fell upon the form of Clym,
glistening with wet, whom Wildeve immediately recognized; but Wildeve,
who stood behind the lamp, was not at once recognized by Yeobright.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) stopped as if in doubt whether this waiting vehicle could have
anything to do with the flight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) wife or not. The sight of
Yeobright at once banished Wildeve's sober feelings, who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) again
as the deadly rival from whom Eustacia was to be kept at all hazards.
Hence Wildeve did not speak, in the hope that Clym would pass by without
particular inquiry.

<p/>While they both hung thus in hesitation a dull sound became audible
above the storm and wind. Its origin was unmistakable--it was the fall
of a body into the stream in the adjoining mead, apparently at a point
near the weir.

<p/>Both started. <div class="bookquote">``Good God! can it be she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should it be she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>said Wildeve, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) alarm forgetting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
had hitherto screened himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--that's you, you traitor, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Yeobright</b></font>)</div>cried Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``Why should it
be she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)? Because last week she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would have put an end to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) life if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
had been able. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to have been watched! Take one of the lamps and
come with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright seized the one on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) side and hastened on; Wildeve did not
wait to unfasten the other, but followed at once along the meadow track
to the weir, a little in the rear of Clym.

<p/>Shadwater Weir had at its foot a large circular pool, fifty feet in
diameter, into which the water flowed through ten huge hatches, raised
and lowered by a winch and cogs in the ordinary manner. The sides of the
pool were of masonry, to prevent the water from washing away the bank;
but the force of the stream in winter was sometimes such as to undermine
the retaining wall and precipitate it into the hole. Clym reached the
hatches, the framework of which was shaken to its foundations by the
velocity of the current. Nothing but the froth of the waves could be
discerned in the pool below. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) got upon the plank bridge over the race,
and holding to the rail, that the wind might not blow him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) off, crossed
to the other side of the river. There he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) leant over the wall and lowered
the lamp, only to behold the vortex formed at the curl of the returning
current.

<p/>Wildeve meanwhile had arrived on the former side, and the light from
Yeobright's lamp shed a flecked and agitated radiance across the weir
pool, revealing to the ex-engineer the tumbling courses of the currents
from the hatches above. Across this gashed and puckered mirror a dark
body was slowly borne by one of the backward currents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Wildeve in an agonized voice; and, without
showing sufficient presence of mind even to throw off his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) greatcoat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
leaped into the boiling caldron.

<p/>Yeobright could now also discern the floating body, though but
indistinctly; and imagining from Wildeve's plunge that there was life to
be saved he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was about to leap after. Bethinking himself of a wiser plan,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) placed the lamp against a post to make it stand upright, and running
round to the lower part of the pool, where there was no wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) sprang
in and boldly waded upwards towards the deeper portion. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was
taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) legs, and in swimming was carried round into the centre of
the basin, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) perceived Wildeve struggling.

<p/>While these hasty actions were in progress here, Venn and Thomasin had
been toiling through the lower corner of the heath in the direction
of the light. They had not been near enough to the river to hear the
plunge, but they saw the removal of the carriage lamp, and watched its
motion into the mead. As soon as they reached the car and horse Venn
guessed that something new was amiss, and hastened to follow in the
course of the moving light. Venn walked faster than Thomasin, and came
to the weir alone.

<p/>The lamp placed against the post by Clym still shone across the
water, and the reddleman observed something floating motionless. Being
encumbered with the infant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) ran back to meet Thomasin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the baby, please, Mrs. Wildeve,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said hastily. <div class="bookquote">``Run home with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>), call the stable lad, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) send down to me any men who may
be living near. Somebody has fallen into the weir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin took the child and ran. When she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came to the covered car the
horse, though fresh from the stable, was standing perfectly still, as
if conscious of misfortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) saw for the first time whose it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
nearly fainted, and would have been unable to proceed another step but
that the necessity of preserving the little girl from harm nerved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
to an amazing self-control. In this agony of suspense she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entered the
house, put the baby in a place of safety, woke the lad and the female
domestic, and ran out to give the alarm at the nearest cottage.

<p/>Diggory, having returned to the brink of the pool, observed that the
small upper hatches or floats were withdrawn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) found one of these
lying upon the grass, and taking it under one arm, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) lantern
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) hand, entered at the bottom of the pool as Clym had done. As soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) began to be in deep water he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) flung himself across the hatch; thus
supported he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) was able to keep afloat as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) chose, holding
the lantern aloft with his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) disengaged hand. Propelled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>)
steered round and round the pool, ascending each time by one of the back
streams and descending in the middle of the current.

<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) could see nothing. Then amidst the glistening of the
whirlpools and the white clots of foam he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) distinguished a woman's bonnet
floating alone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) search was now under the left wall, when something
came to the surface almost close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>). It was not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) had
expected, a woman, but a man. The reddleman put the ring of the lantern
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) teeth, seized the floating man by the collar, and, holding
on to the hatch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) remaining arm, struck out into the strongest
race, by which the unconscious man, the hatch, and himself were carried
down the stream. As soon as Venn found his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) feet dragging over the
pebbles of the shallower part below he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) secured his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) footing and waded
towards the brink. There, where the water stood at about the height of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) waist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) flung away the hatch, and attempted to drag forth the man.
This was a matter of great difficulty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found as the reason that
the legs of the unfortunate stranger were tightly embraced by the arms
of another man, who had hitherto been entirely beneath the surface.

<p/>At this moment his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart bounded to hear footsteps running towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
and two men, roused by Thomasin, appeared at the brink above. They ran
to where Venn was, and helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) in lifting out the apparently drowned
persons, separating them, and laying them out upon the grass. Venn
turned the light upon their faces. The one who had been uppermost was
Yeobright; he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) who had been completely submerged was Wildeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we must search the hole again,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn. <div class="bookquote">``A woman is in there
somewhere. Get a pole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the men went to the footbridge and tore off the handrail. The
reddleman and the two others then entered the water together from below
as before, and with their united force probed the pool forwards to where
it sloped down to its central depth. Venn was not mistaken in supposing
that any person who had sunk for the last time would be washed down to
this point, for when they had examined to about halfway across something
impeded their thrust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pull it forward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Venn, and they raked it in with the pole till it
was close to their feet.

<p/>Venn vanished under the stream, and came up with an armful of wet
drapery enclosing a woman's cold form, which was all that remained of
the desperate Eustacia.

<p/>When they reached the bank there stood Thomasin, in a stress of grief,
bending over the two unconscious ones who already lay there. The horse
and cart were brought to the nearest point in the road, and it was the
work of a few minutes only to place the three in the vehicle. Venn
led on the horse, supporting Thomasin upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) arm, and the two men
followed, till they reached the inn.

<p/>The woman who had been shaken out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleep by Thomasin had hastily
dressed herself and lighted a fire, the other servant being left to
snore on in peace at the back of the house. The insensible forms of
Eustacia, Clym, and Wildeve were then brought in and laid on the carpet,
with their feet to the fire, when such restorative processes as could
be thought of were adopted at once, the stableman being in the meantime
sent for a doctor. But there seemed to be not a whiff of life in either
of the bodies. Then Thomasin, whose stupor of grief had been thrust
off awhile by frantic action, applied a bottle of hartshorn to Clym's
nostrils, having tried it in vain upon the other two. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clym's alive!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) soon breathed distinctly, and again and again did she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) attempt to
revive her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) husband by the same means; but Wildeve gave no sign. There
was too much reason to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) and Eustacia both were for ever
beyond the reach of stimulating perfumes. Their exertions did not relax
till the doctor arrived, when one by one, the senseless three were taken
upstairs and put into warm beds.

<p/>Venn soon felt himself relieved from further attendance, and went to
the door, scarcely able yet to realize the strange catastrophe that
had befallen the family in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) took so great an interest. Thomasin
surely would be broken down by the sudden and overwhelming nature of
this event. No firm and sensible Mrs. Yeobright lived now to support the
gentle girl through the ordeal; and, whatever an unimpassioned spectator
might think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) loss of such a husband as Wildeve, there could be no
doubt that for the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) was distracted and horrified by the blow.
As for himself, not being privileged to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) and comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
saw no reason for waiting longer in a house where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) remained only as a
stranger.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) returned across the heath to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) van. The fire was not yet out, and
everything remained as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had left it. Venn now bethought himself of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) clothes, which were saturated with water to the weight of lead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
changed them, spread them before the fire, and lay down to sleep. But
it was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) could do to rest here while excited by a vivid
imagination of the turmoil they were in at the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had quitted,
and, blaming himself for coming away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) dressed in another suit,
locked up the door, and again hastened across to the inn. Rain was still
falling heavily when he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) entered the kitchen. A bright fire was shining
from the hearth, and two women were bustling about, one of whom was Olly
Dowden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how is it going on now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Yeobright is better; but Mrs. Yeobright and Mr. Wildeve are dead
and cold. The doctor says they were quite gone before they were out of
the water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I thought as much when I hauled `em up. And Mrs. Wildeve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) is as well as can be expected. The doctor had her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) put between
blankets, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was almost as wet as they that had been in the river,
poor young thing. You don't seem very dry, reddleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, `tis not much. I have changed my things. This is only a little
dampness I've got coming through the rain again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand by the fire. Mis'ess says you be to have whatever you want, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was sorry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) was told that you'd gone away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn drew near to the fireplace, and looked into the flames in an absent
mood. The steam came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) leggings and ascended the chimney with the
smoke, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) thought of those who were upstairs. Two were corpses,
one had barely escaped the jaws of death, another was sick and a widow.
The last occasion on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had lingered by that fireplace was when
the raffle was in progress; when Wildeve was alive and well; Thomasin
active and smiling in the next room; Yeobright and Eustacia just made
husband and wife, and Mrs. Yeobright living at Blooms-End. It had seemed
at that time that the then position of affairs was good for at least
twenty years to come. Yet, of all the circle, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) himself was the only
one whose situation had not materially changed.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ruminated a footstep descended the stairs. It was the nurse,
who brought in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hand a rolled mass of wet paper. The woman was so
engrossed with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) occupation that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hardly saw Venn. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took from a
cupboard some pieces of twine, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strained across the fireplace,
tying the end of each piece to the firedog, previously pulled forward
for the purpose, and, unrolling the wet papers, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began pinning them
one by one to the strings in a manner of clothes on a line.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What be they?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor master's banknotes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``They were found in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pocket
when they undressed him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was not coming back again for some time?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That we shall never know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>Venn was loth to depart, for all on earth that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) lay under
this roof. As nobody in the house had any more sleep that night, except
the two who slept for ever, there was no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) should not
remain. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) retired into the niche of the fireplace where he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had used
to sit, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) continued, watching the steam from the double row
of banknotes as they waved backwards and forwards in the draught of the
chimney till their flaccidity was changed to dry crispness throughout.
Then the woman came and unpinned them, and, folding them together,
carried the handful upstairs. Presently the doctor appeared from above
with the look of a man who could do no more, and, pulling on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gloves,
went out of the house, the trotting of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse soon dying away upon
the road.

<p/>At four o’clock there was a gentle knock at the door. It was from
Charley, who had been sent by Captain Vye to inquire if anything had
been heard of Eustacia. The girl who admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) looked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) face as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not know what answer to return, and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) in to where
Venn was seated, saying to the reddleman, <div class="bookquote">``Will you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the reddleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn told. Charley's only utterance was a feeble, indistinct sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
stood quite still; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) burst out spasmodically, <div class="bookquote">``I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
once more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you may see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Diggory gravely. <div class="bookquote">``But hadn't you
better run and tell Captain Vye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. Only I do hope I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) just once again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lazarus</b></font>)</div>said a low voice behind; and starting round they beheld
by the dim light, a thin, pallid, almost spectral form, wrapped in a
blanket, and looking like Lazarus coming from the tomb.

<p/>It was Yeobright. Neither Venn nor Charley spoke, and Clym continued,
<div class="bookquote">``You shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>). There will be time enough to tell the captain when
it gets daylight. You would like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) too--would you not, Diggory?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) looks very beautiful now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn assented by rising to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) feet, and with Charley he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) followed Clym
to the foot of the staircase, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) boots; Charley did
the same. They followed Yeobright upstairs to the landing, where there
was a candle burning, which Yeobright took in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) hand, and with it led
the way into an adjoining room. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) went to the bedside and folded
back the sheet.

<p/>They stood silently looking upon Eustacia, who, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) lay there still
in death, eclipsed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) living phases. Pallor did not include all
the quality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) complexion, which seemed more than whiteness; it was
almost light. The expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) finely carved mouth was pleasant,
as if a sense of dignity had just compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) to leave off speaking.
Eternal rigidity had seized upon it in a momentary transition between
fervour and resignation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) black hair was looser now than either of
them had ever seen it before, and surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) brow like a forest. The
stateliness of look which had been almost too marked for a dweller in a
country domicile had at last found an artistically happy background.

<p/>Nobody spoke, till at length Clym covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) and turned aside. <div class="bookquote">``Now
come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said.

<p/>They went to a recess in the same room, and there, on a smaller bed,
lay another figure--Wildeve. Less repose was visible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) face than
in Eustacia's, but the same luminous youthfulness overspread it, and the
least sympathetic observer would have felt at sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
was born for a higher destiny than this. The only sign upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
recent struggle for life was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) fingertips, which were worn and
sacrificed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) dying endeavours to obtain a hold on the face of the
weir-wall.

<p/>Yeobright's manner had been so quiet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) had uttered so few syllables
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) reappearance, that Venn imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) resigned. It was only
when they had left the room and stood upon the landing that the true
state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) mind was apparent. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said, with a wild smile,
inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) head towards the chamber in which Eustacia lay, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) is
the second woman I have killed this year. I was a great cause of my
mother's death, and I am the chief cause of hers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eustacia/Miss Eustacia/EUSTACIA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I spoke cruel words to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left my house. I did not invite her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
back till it was too late. It is I who ought to have drowned myself. It
would have been a charity to the living had the river overwhelmed me and
borne her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up. But I cannot die. Those who ought to have lived lie dead;
and here am I alive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can't charge yourself with crimes in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn. <div class="bookquote">``You
may as well say that the parents be the cause of a murder by the child,
for without the parents the child would never have been begot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Venn, that is very true; but you don't know all the circumstances.
If it had pleased God to put an end to me it would have been a good
thing for all. But I am getting used to the horror of my existence. They
say that a time comes when men laugh at misery through long acquaintance
with it. Surely that time will soon come to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your aim has always been good,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn. <div class="bookquote">``Why should you say such
desperate things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they are not desperate. They are only hopeless; and my great regret
is that for what I have done no man or law can punish me!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Wildeve/Mr. Wildeve/MR. WILDEVE</b></font>)</div><p/>BOOK SIX -- AFTERCOURSES




<p/>1--The Inevitable Movement Onward


<p/>The story of the deaths of Eustacia and Wildeve was told throughout
Egdon, and far beyond, for many weeks and months. All the known
incidents of their love were enlarged, distorted, touched up, and
modified, till the original reality bore but a slight resemblance to the
counterfeit presentation by surrounding tongues. Yet, upon the whole,
neither the man nor the woman lost dignity by sudden death. Misfortune
had struck them gracefully, cutting off their erratic histories with a
catastrophic dash, instead of, as with many, attenuating each life to an
uninteresting meagreness, through long years of wrinkles, neglect, and
decay.

<p/>On those most nearly concerned the effect was somewhat different.
Strangers who had heard of many such cases now merely heard of one more;
but immediately where a blow falls no previous imaginings amount to
appreciable preparation for it. The very suddenness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bereavement
dulled, to some extent, Thomasin's feelings; yet irrationally enough, a
consciousness that the husband she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had lost ought to have been a better
man did not lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mourning at all. On the contrary, this fact
seemed at first to set off the dead husband in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) young wife's eyes,
and to be the necessary cloud to the rainbow.

<p/>But the horrors of the unknown had passed. Vague misgivings about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
future as a deserted wife were at an end. The worst had once been matter
of trembling conjecture; it was now matter of reason only, a limited
badness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chief interest, the little Eustacia, still remained. There
was humility in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grief, no defiance in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) attitude; and when this is
the case a shaken spirit is apt to be stilled.

<p/>Could Thomasin's mournfulness now and Eustacia's serenity during life
have been reduced to common measure, they would have touched the same
mark nearly. But Thomasin's former brightness made shadow of that which
in a sombre atmosphere was light itself.

<p/>The spring came and calmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); the summer came and soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>); the
autumn arrived, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) began to be comforted, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) little girl
was strong and happy, growing in size and knowledge every day. Outward
events flattered Thomasin not a little. Wildeve had died intestate, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) and the child were his (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) only relatives. When administration had been
granted, all the debts paid, and the residue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) husband's uncle's
property had come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) hands, it was found that the sum waiting to
be invested for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) own and the child's benefit was little less than ten
thousand pounds.

<p/>Where should she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) live? The obvious place was Blooms-End. The old rooms,
it is true, were not much higher than the between-decks of a frigate,
necessitating a sinking in the floor under the new clock-case she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
brought from the inn, and the removal of the handsome brass knobs on its
head, before there was height for it to stand; but, such as the rooms
were, there were plenty of them, and the place was endeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) by
every early recollection. Clym very gladly admitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) as a tenant,
confining his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own existence to two rooms at the top of the back
staircase, where he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lived on quietly, shut off from Thomasin and the
three servants she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had thought fit to indulge in now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was a
mistress of money, going his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own ways, and thinking his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own thoughts.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sorrows had made some change in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) outward appearance; and yet the
alteration was chiefly within. It might have been said that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had a
wrinkled mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had no enemies, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could get nobody to reproach
him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), which was why he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) so bitterly reproached himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) did sometimes think he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had been ill-used by fortune, so far as to say
that to be born is a palpable dilemma, and that instead of men aiming to
advance in life with glory they should calculate how to retreat out
of it without shame. But that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had been sarcastically and
pitilessly handled in having such irons thrust into their souls he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) did
not maintain long. It is usually so, except with the sternest of men.
Human beings, in their generous endeavour to construct a hypothesis that
shall not degrade a First Cause, have always hesitated to conceive a
dominant power of lower moral quality than their own; and, even while
they sit down and weep by the waters of Babylon, invent excuses for the
oppression which prompts their tears.

<p/>Thus, though words of solace were vainly uttered in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) presence, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
found relief in a direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own choosing when left to himself.
For a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) habits the house and the hundred and twenty pounds a
year which he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mother were enough to supply all
worldly needs. Resources do not depend upon gross amounts, but upon the
proportion of spendings to takings.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) frequently walked the heath alone, when the past seized upon him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
with its shadowy hand, and held him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) there to listen to its tale.
His (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) imagination would then people the spot with its ancient
inhabitants--forgotten Celtic tribes trod their tracks about him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
could almost live among them, look in their faces, and see them standing
beside the barrows which swelled around, untouched and perfect as at the
time of their erection. Those of the dyed barbarians who had chosen
the cultivable tracts were, in comparison with those who had left their
marks here, as writers on paper beside writers on parchment. Their
records had perished long ago by the plough, while the works of these
remained. Yet they all had lived and died unconscious of the different
fates awaiting their relics. It reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) that unforeseen factors
operate in the evolution of immortality.

<p/>Winter again came round, with its winds, frosts, tame robins, and
sparkling starlight. The year previous Thomasin had hardly been
conscious of the season's advance; this year she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) heart open to
external influences of every kind. The life of this sweet cousin, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
baby, and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) servants, came to Clym's senses only in the form of sounds
through a wood partition as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sat over books of exceptionally large
type; but his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) ear became at last so accustomed to these slight noises
from the other part of the house that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) almost could witness the
scenes they signified. A faint beat of half-seconds conjured up Thomasin
rocking the cradle, a wavering hum meant that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was singing the baby
to sleep, a crunching of sand as between millstones raised the picture
of Humphrey's, Fairway's, or Sam's heavy feet crossing the stone floor
of the kitchen; a light boyish step, and a gay tune in a high key,
betokened a visit from Grandfer Cantle; a sudden break-off in the
Grandfer's utterances implied the application to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) lips of a mug of
small beer, a bustling and slamming of doors meant starting to go to
market; for Thomasin, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) added scope of gentility, led a
ludicrously narrow life, to the end that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) might save every possible
pound for her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) little daughter.

<p/>One summer day Clym was in the garden, immediately outside the parlour
window, which was as usual open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was looking at the pot-flowers on
the sill; they had been revived and restored by Thomasin to the state in
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother had left them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) heard a slight scream from Thomasin,
who was sitting inside the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, how you frightened me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said to someone who had entered. <div class="bookquote">``I
thought you were the ghost of yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym was curious enough to advance a little further and look in at the
window. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) astonishment there stood within the room Diggory Venn,
no longer a reddleman, but exhibiting the strangely altered hues of
an ordinary Christian countenance, white shirt-front, light flowered
waistcoat, blue-spotted neckerchief, and bottle-green coat. Nothing in
this appearance was at all singular but the fact of its great difference
from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had formerly been. Red, and all approach to red, was
carefully excluded from every article of clothes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>); for what is
there that persons just out of harness dread so much as reminders of the
trade which has enriched them?

<p/>Yeobright went round to the door and entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was so alarmed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin, smiling from one to the other. <div class="bookquote">``I
couldn't believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had got white of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own accord! It seemed
supernatural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave up dealing in reddle last Christmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Venn. <div class="bookquote">``It was a
profitable trade, and I found that by that time I had made enough to
take the dairy of fifty cows that my father had in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lifetime. I
always thought of getting to that place again if I changed at all, and
now I am there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you manage to become white, Diggory?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Thomasin asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I turned so by degrees, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look much better than ever you did before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn appeared confused; and Thomasin, seeing how inadvertently she (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had
spoken to a man who might possibly have tender feelings for her (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) still,
blushed a little. Clym saw nothing of this, and added good-humouredly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we have to frighten Thomasin's baby with, now you have
become a human being again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Diggory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin, <div class="bookquote">``and stay to tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn moved as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) would retire to the kitchen, when Thomasin said with
pleasant pertness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) went on with some sewing, <div class="bookquote">``Of course you must
sit down here. And where does your fifty-cow dairy lie, Mr. Venn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Stickleford--about two miles to the right of Alderworth, ma’am,
where the meads begin. I have thought that if Mr. Yeobright would like
to pay me a visit sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) shouldn't stay away for want of asking.
I'll not bide to tea this afternoon, thank'ee, for I've got something on
hand that must be settled. `Tis Maypole-day tomorrow, and the Shadwater
folk have clubbed with a few of your neighbours here to have a pole just
outside your palings in the heath, as it is a nice green place.''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>Venn
waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) elbow towards the patch in front of the house. <div class="bookquote">``I have been
talking to Fairway about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``and I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yeobright</b></font>) that
before we put up the pole it would be as well to ask Mrs. Wildeve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can say nothing against it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Our property does not
reach an inch further than the white palings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you might not like to see a lot of folk going crazy round a stick,
under your very nose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have no objection at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Venn soon after went away, and in the evening Yeobright strolled as far
as Fairway's cottage. It was a lovely May sunset, and the birch trees
which grew on this margin of the vast Egdon wilderness had put on their
new leaves, delicate as butterflies' wings, and diaphanous as amber.
Beside Fairway's dwelling was an open space recessed from the road, and
here were now collected all the young people from within a radius of a
couple of miles. The pole lay with one end supported on a trestle,
and women were engaged in wreathing it from the top downwards with
wild-flowers. The instincts of merry England lingered on here with
exceptional vitality, and the symbolic customs which tradition has
attached to each season of the year were yet a reality on Egdon. Indeed,
the impulses of all such outlandish hamlets are pagan still--in these
spots homage to nature, self-adoration, frantic gaieties, fragments of
Teutonic rites to divinities whose names are forgotten, seem in some way
or other to have survived mediaeval doctrine.

<p/>Yeobright did not interrupt the preparations, and went home again. The
next morning, when Thomasin withdrew the curtains of her (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) bedroom window,
there stood the Maypole in the middle of the green, its top cutting into
the sky. It had sprung up in the night, or rather early morning, like
Jack's bean-stalk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) opened the casement to get a better view of the
garlands and posies that adorned it. The sweet perfume of the flowers
had already spread into the surrounding air, which, being free from
every taint, conducted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) lips a full measure of the fragrance
received from the spire of blossom in its midst. At the top of the
pole were crossed hoops decked with small flowers; beneath these came a
milk-white zone of Maybloom; then a zone of bluebells, then of cowslips,
then of lilacs, then of ragged-robins, daffodils, and so on, till the
lowest stage was reached. Thomasin noticed all these, and was delighted
that the May revel was to be so near.

<p/>When afternoon came people began to gather on the green, and Yeobright
was interested enough to look out upon them from the open window of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) room. Soon after this Thomasin walked out from the door immediately
below and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) eyes up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) cousin's face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) was dressed
more gaily than Yeobright had ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) dressed since the time of
Wildeve's death, eighteen months before; since the day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) marriage
even she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) had not exhibited herself to such advantage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How pretty you look today, Thomasin!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Is it because of the
Maypole?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not altogether.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) blushed and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) eyes, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)
did not specially observe, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) manner seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) to be rather
peculiar, considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) was only addressing himself. Could it be
possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) had put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) summer clothes to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>)?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Thomasin</b></font>) conduct towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) throughout the last few weeks, when
they had often been working together in the garden, just as they had
formerly done when they were boy and girl under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother's eye. What
if her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were not so entirely that of a relative as it had
formerly been? To Yeobright any possibility of this sort was a serious
matter; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) almost felt troubled at the thought of it. Every pulse of
loverlike feeling which had not been stilled during Eustacia's lifetime
had gone into the grave with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had occurred too
far on in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) manhood to leave fuel enough on hand for another fire
of that sort, as may happen with more boyish loves. Even supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
capable of loving again, that love would be a plant of slow and laboured
growth, and in the end only small and sickly, like an autumn-hatched
bird.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was so distressed by this new complexity that when the enthusiastic
brass band arrived and struck up, which it did about five o’clock, with
apparently wind enough among its members to blow down his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) house, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
withdrew from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rooms by the back door, went down the garden, through
the gate in the hedge, and away out of sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not bear to
remain in the presence of enjoyment today, though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had tried hard.

<p/>Nothing was seen of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for four hours. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came back by the same
path it was dusk, and the dews were coating every green thing. The
boisterous music had ceased; but, entering the premises as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did from
behind, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not see if the May party had all gone till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had
passed through Thomasin's division of the house to the front door.
Thomasin was standing within the porch alone.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``You went away just when it began,
Clym,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I felt I could not join in. You went out with them, of course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I did not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You appeared to be dressed on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I could not go out alone; so many people were there. One is
there now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright strained his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes across the dark-green patch beyond the
paling, and near the black form of the Maypole he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) discerned a shadowy
figure, sauntering idly up and down. <div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Venn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) to come in, I think, Tamsie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) has been very
kind to you first and last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said; and, acting on the impulse, went through the
wicket to where Venn stood under the Maypole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Mr. Venn, I think?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) inquired.

<p/>Venn started as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--artful man that he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) was--and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen you dancing this evening, and you had the very best of the
girls for your partners. Is it that you won't come in because you wish
to stand here, and think over the past hours of enjoyment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's partly it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Venn</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Venn, with ostentatious sentiment.
<div class="bookquote">``But the main reason why I am biding here like this is that I want to
wait till the moon rises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see how pretty the Maypole looks in the moonlight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. To look for a glove that was dropped by one of the maidens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin was speechless with surprise. That a man who had to walk
some four or five miles to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home should wait here for such a reason
pointed to only one conclusion--the man must be amazingly interested in
that glove's owner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), Diggory?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked, in a voice which
revealed that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had made himself considerably more interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
by this disclosure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will not come in, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not tonight, thank you, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I lend you a lantern to look for the young person's glove, Mr.
Venn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no; it is not necessary, Mrs. Wildeve, thank you. The moon will rise
in a few minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin went back to the porch. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) coming in?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Clym, who had
been waiting where she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) would rather not tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, and then passed by him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) into the
house; whereupon Clym too retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) own rooms.

<p/>When Clym was gone Thomasin crept upstairs in the dark, and, just
listening by the cot, to assure herself that the child was asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
went to the window, gently lifted the corner of the white curtain, and
looked out. Venn was still there. She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) watched the growth of the faint
radiance appearing in the sky by the eastern hill, till presently
the edge of the moon burst upwards and flooded the valley with light.
Diggory's form was now distinct on the green; he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) was moving about in a
bowed attitude, evidently scanning the grass for the precious missing
article, walking in zigzags right and left till he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) should have passed
over every foot of the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very ridiculous!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Thomasin murmured to herself, in a tone which was
intended to be satirical. <div class="bookquote">``To think that a man should be so silly as to
go mooning about like that for a girl's glove! A respectable dairyman,
too, and a man of money as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is now. What a pity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At last Venn appeared to find it; whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) stood up and raised it to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) lips. Then placing it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) breastpocket--the nearest receptacle to
a man's heart permitted by modern raiment--he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) ascended the valley in a
mathematically direct line towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) distant home in the meadows.



<p/>2--Thomasin Walks in a Green Place by the Roman Road


<p/>Clym saw little of Thomasin for several days after this; and when they
met she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was more silent than usual. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was
thinking of so intently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thoroughly perplexed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said candidly. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot for my life
think who it is that Diggory Venn is so much in love with. None of the
girls at the Maypole were good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>), and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must have
been there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym tried to imagine Venn's choice for a moment; but ceasing to be
interested in the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) went on again with his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) gardening.

<p/>No clearing up of the mystery was granted her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for some time. But one
afternoon Thomasin was upstairs getting ready for a walk, when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
occasion to come to the landing and call <div class="bookquote">``Rachel.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Rachel was a girl
about thirteen, who carried the baby out for airings; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) came
upstairs at the call.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen one of my last new gloves about the house, Rachel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>inquired Thomasin. <div class="bookquote">``It is the fellow to this one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rachel</b></font>)</div><p/>Rachel did not reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you answer?''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) mistress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is lost, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lost? Who lost it? I have never worn them but once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rachel</b></font>)</div><p/>Rachel appeared as one dreadfully troubled, and at last began to cry.
<div class="bookquote">``Please, ma’am, on the day of the Maypole I had none to wear, and I seed
yours on the table, and I thought I would borrow `em. I did not mean to
hurt `em at all, but one of them got lost. Somebody gave me some money
to buy another pair for you, but I have not been able to go anywhere to
get `em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's somebody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Venn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) know it was my glove?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin was so surprised by the explanation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) quite forgot
to lecture the girl, who glided silently away. Thomasin did not move
further than to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) eyes upon the grass-plat where the Maypole had
stood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) remained thinking, then said to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) would not go
out that afternoon, but would work hard at the baby's unfinished lovely
plaid frock, cut on the cross in the newest fashion. How she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) managed to
work hard, and yet do no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had done at the end of two hours,
would have been a mystery to anyone not aware that the recent incident
was of a kind likely to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) industry from a manual to a mental
channel.

<p/>Next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) went her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) ways as usual, and continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) custom of walking
in the heath with no other companion than little Eustacia, now of the
age when it is a matter of doubt with such characters whether they are
intended to walk through the world on their hands or on their feet; so
that they get into painful complications by trying both. It was very
pleasant to Thomasin, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) had carried the child to some lonely
place, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) a little private practice on the green turf and
shepherd's-thyme, which formed a soft mat to fall headlong upon them
when equilibrium was lost.

<p/>Once, when engaged in this system of training, and stooping to remove
bits of stick, fern-stalks, and other such fragments from the child's
path, that the journey might not be brought to an untimely end by
some insuperable barrier a quarter of an inch high, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) was alarmed by
discovering that a man on horseback was almost close beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), the
soft natural carpet having muffled the horse's tread. The rider, who was
Venn, waved his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) hat in the air and bowed gallantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Diggory, give me my glove,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin, whose manner it was under
any circumstances to plunge into the midst of a subject which engrossed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>Venn immediately dismounted, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) breastpocket, and
handed the glove.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. It was very good of you to take care of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very good of you to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no. I was quite glad to find you had it. Everybody gets so
indifferent that I was surprised to know you thought of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had remembered what I was once you wouldn't have been
surprised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``But men of your character are mostly so
independent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is my character?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't exactly know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin simply, <div class="bookquote">``except it is to cover up
your feelings under a practical manner, and only to show them when you
are alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how do you know that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Venn strategically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>), stopping to put the little girl, who had managed to
get herself upside down, right end up again, <div class="bookquote">``because I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't judge by folks in general,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Venn. <div class="bookquote">``Still I don't know
much what feelings are nowadays. I have got so mixed up with business
of one sort and t'other that my soft sentiments are gone off in vapour
like. Yes, I am given up body and soul to the making of money. Money is
all my dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Diggory, how wicked!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Thomasin reproachfully, and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
in exact balance between taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) words seriously and judging them as
said to tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, `tis rather a rum course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Venn, in the bland tone of one
comfortably resigned to sins he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) could no longer overcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, who used to be so nice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's an argument I rather like, because what a man has once
been he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Thomasin blushed. <div class="bookquote">``Except that it is rather
harder now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>Venn continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you be richer than you were at that time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--not much. I have made it nearly all over to the baby, as it was
my duty to do, except just enough to live on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am rather glad of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div>said Venn softly, and regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) from the
corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) eye, <div class="bookquote">``for it makes it easier for us to be friendly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Venn/Diggory/Diggory Venn</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomasin blushed again, and, when a few more words had been said of a
not unpleasing kind, Venn mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) horse and rode on.

<p/>This conversation had passed in a hollow of the heath near the old
Roman road, a place much frequented by Thomasin. And it might have been
observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) did not in future walk that way less often from having
met Venn there now. Whether or not Venn abstained from riding thither
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had met Thomasin in the same place might easily have been
guessed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) proceedings about two months later in the same year.




<p/>3--The Serious Discourse of Clym with His (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) Cousin


<p/>Throughout this period Yeobright had more or less pondered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) duty
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) cousin Thomasin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) could not help feeling that it would be a
pitiful waste of sweet material if the tender-natured thing should be
doomed from this early stage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) life onwards to dribble away her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)
winsome qualities on lonely gorse and fern. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) felt this as an
economist merely, and not as a lover. His (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) passion for Eustacia had been
a sort of conserve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) whole life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had nothing more of that
supreme quality left to bestow. So far the obvious thing was not to
entertain any idea of marriage with Thomasin, even to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>).

<p/>But this was not all. Years ago there had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) mother's mind a
great fancy about Thomasin and himself. It had not positively amounted
to a desire, but it had always been a favourite dream. That they
should be man and wife in good time, if the happiness of neither were
endangered thereby, was the fancy in question. So that what course save
one was there now left for any son who reverenced his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother's memory
as Yeobright did? It is an unfortunate fact that any particular whim of
parents, which might have been dispersed by half an hour's conversation
during their lives, becomes sublimated by their deaths into a fiat the
most absolute, with such results to conscientious children as those
parents, had they lived, would have been the first to decry.

<p/>Had only Yeobright's own future been involved he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have proposed to
Thomasin with a ready heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had nothing to lose by carrying out a
dead mother's hope. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dreaded to contemplate Thomasin wedded to the
mere corpse of a lover that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) now felt himself to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had but three
activities alive in him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). One was his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) almost daily walk to the little
graveyard wherein his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mother lay, another, his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) just as frequent visits
by night to the more distant enclosure which numbered his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) Eustacia among
its dead; the third was self-preparation for a vocation which alone
seemed likely to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cravings--that of an itinerant preacher
of the eleventh commandment. It was difficult to believe that Thomasin
would be cheered by a husband with such tendencies as these.

<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) resolved to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) decide for herself. It was even
with a pleasant sense of doing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) duty that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went downstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
one evening for this purpose, when the sun was printing on the valley
the same long shadow of the housetop that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had seen lying there times
out of number while his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother lived.

<p/>Thomasin was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in the front garden. <div class="bookquote">``I
have long been wanting, Thomasin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``to say something about a
matter that concerns both our futures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are going to say it now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remarked quickly, colouring as
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gaze. <div class="bookquote">``Do stop a minute, Clym, and let me speak first, for
oddly enough, I have been wanting to say something to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means say on, Tamsie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose nobody can overhear us?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went on, casting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes around
and lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Well, first you will promise me this--that you
won't be angry and call me anything harsh if you disagree with what I
propose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>Yeobright promised, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``What I want is your advice,
for you are my relation--I mean, a sort of guardian to me--aren't you,
Clym?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, I suppose I am; a sort of guardian. In fact, I am, of
course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, altogether perplexed as to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) drift.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thinking of marrying,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) then observed blandly. <div class="bookquote">``But I shall not
marry unless you assure me that you approve of such a step. Why don't
you speak?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was taken rather by surprise. But, nevertheless, I am very glad to
hear such news. I shall approve, of course, dear Tamsie. Who can it be?
I am quite at a loss to guess. No I am not--`tis the old doctor!--not
that I mean to call him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) old, for he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is not very old after all. Ah--I
noticed when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) attended you last time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said hastily. ```Tis Mr. Venn.''

<p/>Clym's face suddenly became grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, now, you don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and I wish I hadn't mentioned him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
exclaimed almost petulantly. <div class="bookquote">``And I shouldn't have done it, either, only
he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) keeps on bothering me so till I don't know what to do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym looked at the heath. <div class="bookquote">``I like Venn well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) answered at
last. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) is a very honest and at the same time astute man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) is clever
too, as is proved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) having got you to favour him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>). But really,
Thomasin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) is not quite--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentleman enough for me? That is just what I feel. I am sorry now that
I asked you, and I won't think any more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>). At the same time I must
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) if I marry anybody--that I WILL say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Clym, carefully concealing every clue to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
own interrupted intention, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) plainly had not guessed. <div class="bookquote">``You might
marry a professional man, or somebody of that sort, by going into the
town to live and forming acquaintances there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not fit for town life--so very rural and silly as I always have
been. Do not you yourself notice my countrified ways?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, when I came home from Paris I did, a little; but I don't now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's because you have got countrified too. O, I couldn't live in a
street for the world! Egdon is a ridiculous old place; but I have got
used to it, and I couldn't be happy anywhere else at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither could I,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then how could you say that I should marry some town man? I am sure,
say what you will, that I must marry Diggory, if I marry at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) has
been kinder to me than anybody else, and has helped me in many ways that
I don't know of!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Thomasin almost pouted now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) has,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym in a neutral tone. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I wish with all my
heart that I could say, marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>). But I cannot forget what my mother
thought on that matter, and it goes rather against me not to respect her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
opinion. There is too much reason why we should do the little we can to
respect it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>sighed Thomasin. <div class="bookquote">``I will say no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not bound to obey my wishes. I merely say what I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--I don't want to be rebellious in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I
had no business to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--I ought to have thought of my family.
What dreadfully bad impulses there are in me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips trembled, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned away to hide a tear.

<p/>Clym, though vexed at what seemed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unaccountable taste, was in a
measure relieved to find that at any rate the marriage question in
relation to himself was shelved. Through several succeeding days he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at different times from the window of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) room moping disconsolately
about the garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) was half angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for choosing Venn; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
was grieved at having put himself in the way of Venn's happiness, who
was, after all, as honest and persevering a young fellow as any on
Egdon, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) had turned over a new leaf. In short, Clym did not know
what to do.

<p/>When next they met she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is much more respectable now
than he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? O yes--Diggory Venn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt only objected because he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) was a reddleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Thomasin, perhaps I don't know all the particulars of my mother's
wish. So you had better use your own discretion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will always feel that I slighted your mother's memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I will not. I shall think you are convinced that, had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seen
Diggory in his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) present position, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) a fitting
husband for you. Now, that's my real feeling. Don't consult me any more,
but do as you like, Thomasin. I shall be content.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>It is to be supposed that Thomasin was convinced; for a few days after
this, when Clym strayed into a part of the heath that he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) had not lately
visited, Humphrey, who was at work there, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am glad to see
that Mrs. Wildeve and Venn have made it up again, seemingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have they?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym abstractedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) do contrive to stumble upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) walks out on
fine days with the chiel. But, Mr. Yeobright, I can't help feeling
that your cousin ought to have married you. `Tis a pity to make two
chimleycorners where there need be only one. You could get her (<font color='blue'><b>Wildeve</b></font>) away from
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) now, `tis my belief, if you were only to set about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``How can I have the conscience to marry after having driven two women to
their deaths? Don't think such a thing, Humphrey. After my experience
I should consider it too much of a burlesque to go to church and take a
wife. In the words of Job, `I have made a covenant with mine eyes; when
then should I think upon a maid?'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Clym, don't fancy that about driving two women to their deaths.
You shouldn't say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we'll leave that out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``But anyhow God has set a
mark upon me which wouldn't look well in a love-making scene. I have two
ideas in my head, and no others. I am going to keep a night-school;
and I am going to turn preacher. What have you got to say to that,
Humphrey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come and hear `ee with all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks. `Tis all I wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div><p/>As Clym descended into the valley Thomasin came down by the other path,
and met him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) at the gate. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think I have to tell you, Clym?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, looking archly over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulder at him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) replied.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) scrutinized his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you guess right. It is going to be after
all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) thinks I may as well make up my mind, and I have got to think
so too. It is to be on the twenty-fifth of next month, if you don't
object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do what you think right, dear. I am only too glad that you see your way
clear to happiness again. My sex owes you every amends for the treatment
you received in days gone by.''  (<font color='red'><b>The writer</b></font>)</div>*

<p/>* The writer may state here that the original conception of
the story did not design a marriage between Thomasin and
Venn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) was to have retained his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) isolated and weird
character to the last, and to have disappeared mysteriously
from the heath, nobody knowing whither--Thomasin remaining a
widow. But certain circumstances of serial publication led
to a change of intent.

<p/>Readers can therefore choose between the endings, and those with an
austere artistic code can assume the more consistent conclusion to be
the true one.




<p/>4--Cheerfulness Again Asserts Itself at Blooms-End, and Clym Finds His (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
Vocation


<p/>Anybody who had passed through Blooms-End about eleven o’clock on the
morning fixed for the wedding would have found that, while Yeobright's
house was comparatively quiet, sounds denoting great activity came from
the dwelling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) nearest neighbour, Timothy Fairway. It was chiefly
a noise of feet, briskly crunching hither and thither over the sanded
floor within. One man only was visible outside, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be
later at an appointment than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had intended to be, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hastened up
to the door, lifted the latch, and walked in without ceremony.

<p/>The scene within was not quite the customary one. Standing about the
room was the little knot of men who formed the chief part of the Egdon
coterie, there being present Fairway himself, Grandfer Cantle, Humphrey,
Christian, and one or two turf-cutters. It was a warm day, and the men
were as a matter of course in their shirtsleeves, except Christian, who
had always a nervous fear of parting with a scrap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) clothing when
in anybody's house but his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own. Across the stout oak table in the middle
of the room was thrown a mass of striped linen, which Grandfer Cantle
held down on one side, and Humphrey on the other, while Fairway rubbed
its surface with a yellow lump, his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) face being damp and creased with the
effort of the labour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Waxing a bed-tick, souls?''  (<font color='red'><b>the newcomer</b></font>)</div>said the newcomer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle, as a man too busy to waste words.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I stretch this corner a shade tighter, Timothy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Fairway replied, and the waxing went on with unabated vigour. ```Tis
going to be a good bed, by the look o't,'' continued Sam, after an
interval of silence. <div class="bookquote">``Who may it be for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the folks</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis a present for the new folks that's going to set up housekeeping,''
said Christian, who stood helpless and overcome by the majesty of the
proceedings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to be sure; and a valuable one, `a b'lieve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beds be dear to fokes that don't keep geese, bain't they, Mister
Fairway?''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div>said Christian, as to an omniscient being.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Humphrey</b></font>)</div>said the furze-dealer, standing up, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) forehead a
thorough mopping, and handing the beeswax to Humphrey, who succeeded
at the rubbing forthwith. <div class="bookquote">``Not that this couple be in want of one, but
`twas well to show `em a bit of friendliness at this great racketing
vagary of their lives. I set up both my own daughters in one when they
was married, and there have been feathers enough for another in the
house the last twelve months. Now then, neighbours, I think we have
laid on enough wax. Grandfer Cantle, you turn the tick the right way
outwards, and then I'll begin to shake in the feathers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Christian/Christian Cantle</b></font>)</div><p/>When the bed was in proper trim Fairway and Christian brought forward
vast paper bags, stuffed to the full, but light as balloons, and began
to turn the contents of each into the receptacle just prepared. As bag
after bag was emptied, airy tufts of down and feathers floated about the
room in increasing quantity till, through a mishap of Christian's, who
shook the contents of one bag outside the tick, the atmosphere of the
room became dense with gigantic flakes, which descended upon the workers
like a windless snowstorm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw such a clumsy chap as you, Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer
Cantle severely. <div class="bookquote">``You might have been the son of a man that's never been
outside Blooms-End in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life for all the wit you have. Really all the
soldiering and smartness in the world in the father seems to count for
nothing in forming the nater of the son. As far as that chief Christian
is concerned I might as well have stayed at home and seed nothing,
like all the rest of ye here. Though, as far as myself is concerned, a
dashing spirit has counted for sommat, to be sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ye let me down so, Father; I feel no bigger than a ninepin after
it. I've made but a bruckle hit, I'm afeard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come. Never pitch yerself in such a low key as that, Christian;
you should try more,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you should try more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>echoed the Grandfer with insistence, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had been the first to make the suggestion. <div class="bookquote">``In common conscience
every man ought either to marry or go for a soldier. `Tis a scandal to
the nation to do neither one nor t'other. I did both, thank God! Neither
to raise men nor to lay `em low--that shows a poor do-nothing spirit
indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never had the nerve to stand fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>faltered Christian. <div class="bookquote">``But as to
marrying, I own I've asked here and there, though without much fruit
from it. Yes, there's some house or other that might have had a man for
a master--such as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is--that's now ruled by a woman alone. Still it
might have been awkward if I had found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); for, d’ye see, neighbours,
there'd have been nobody left at home to keep down Father's spirits to
the decent pitch that becomes a old man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you've your work cut out to do that, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandfer Cantle/Grandfer</b></font>)</div>said Grandfer Cantle
smartly. <div class="bookquote">``I wish that the dread of infirmities was not so strong in
me!--I'd start the very first thing tomorrow to see the world over
again! But seventy-one, though nothing at home, is a high figure for a
rover... Ay, seventy-one, last Candlemasday. Gad, I'd sooner have it in
guineas than in years!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>And the old man sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you be mournful, Grandfer,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``Empt some more
feathers into the bed-tick, and keep up yer heart. Though rather lean in
the stalks you be a green-leaved old man still. There's time enough left
to ye yet to fill whole chronicles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Begad, I'll go to `em, Timothy--to the married pair!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Granfer
Cantle in an encouraged voice, and starting round briskly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go to
`em tonight and sing a wedding song, hey? `Tis like me to do so, you
know; and they'd see it as such. My `Down in Cupid's Gardens' was well
liked in four; still, I've got others as good, and even better. What do
you say to my

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cal'-led to' her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) love'
From the lat'-tice a-bove,
`O come in' from the fog-gy fog'-gy dew'.'

<p/>`Twould please `em well at such a time! Really, now I come to think of
it, I haven't turned my tongue in my head to the shape of a real good
song since Old Midsummer night, when we had the `Barley Mow' at the
Woman; and `tis a pity to neglect your strong point where there's few
that have the compass for such things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So `tis, so `tis,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fairway. <div class="bookquote">``Now gie the bed a shake down. We've
put in seventy pounds of best feathers, and I think that's as many as
the tick will fairly hold. A bit and a drap wouldn't be amiss now, I
reckon. Christian, maul down the victuals from corner-cupboard if canst
reach, man, and I'll draw a drap o' sommat to wet it with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat down to a lunch in the midst of their work, feathers around,
above, and below them; the original owners of which occasionally came
to the open door and cackled begrudgingly at sight of such a quantity of
their old clothes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul I shall be chokt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Fairway when, having extracted a
feather from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) found several others floating on the mug as
it was handed round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've swallered several; and one had a tolerable quill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam
placidly from the corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo--what's that--wheels I hear coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Grandfer Cantle exclaimed,
jumping up and hastening to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis they back again--I
didn't expect `em yet this half-hour. To be sure, how quick marrying can
be done when you are in the mind for't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, it can soon be DONE,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Fairway, as if something should be
added to make the statement complete.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) arose and followed the Grandfer, and the rest also went to the door.
In a moment an open fly was driven past, in which sat Venn and Mrs.
Venn, Yeobright, and a grand relative of Venn's who had come from
Budmouth for the occasion. The fly had been hired at the nearest town,
regardless of distance and cost, there being nothing on Egdon Heath, in
Venn's opinion, dignified enough for such an event when such a woman
as Thomasin was the bride; and the church was too remote for a walking
bridal-party.

<p/>As the fly passed the group which had run out from the homestead they
shouted <div class="bookquote">``Hurrah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and waved their hands; feathers and down floating
from their hair, their sleeves, and the folds of their garments at every
motion, and Grandfer Cantle's seals dancing merrily in the sunlight as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) twirled himself about. The driver of the fly turned a supercilious
gaze upon them; he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) even treated the wedded pair themselves with
something like condescension; for in what other state than heathen could
people, rich or poor, exist who were doomed to abide in such a world's
end as Egdon? Thomasin showed no such superiority to the group at the
door, fluttering her (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) hand as quickly as a bird's wing towards them, and
asking Diggory, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cantle</b></font>) eyes, if they ought not to alight and
speak to these kind neighbours. Venn, however, suggested that, as they
were all coming to the house in the evening, this was hardly necessary.

<p/>After this excitement the saluting party returned to their occupation,
and the stuffing and sewing were soon afterwards finished, when Fairway
harnessed a horse, wrapped up the cumbrous present, and drove off with
it in the cart to Venn's house at Stickleford.


<p/>Yeobright, having filled the office at the wedding service which
naturally fell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) hands, and afterwards returned to the house with
the husband and wife, was indisposed to take part in the feasting and
dancing that wound up the evening. Thomasin was disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could be there without dashing your spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I
might be too much like the skull at the banquet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear, apart from that, if you would excuse me, I should be glad.
I know it seems unkind; but, dear Thomasin, I fear I should not be happy
in the company--there, that's the truth of it. I shall always be coming
to see you at your new home, you know, so that my absence now will not
matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I give in. Do whatever will be most comfortable to yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Clym retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) lodging at the housetop much relieved, and occupied
himself during the afternoon in noting down the heads of a sermon, with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) intended to initiate all that really seemed practicable of the
scheme that had originally brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) hither, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had so long
kept in view under various modifications, and through evil and good
report. He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had tested and weighed his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) convictions again and again, and
saw no reason to alter them, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had considerably lessened his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
plan. His (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) eyesight, by long humouring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) native air, had grown
stronger, but not sufficiently strong to warrant his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) attempting his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
extensive educational project. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) did not repine--there was still
more than enough of an unambitious sort to tax all his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) energies and
occupy all his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) hours.

<p/>Evening drew on, and sounds of life and movement in the lower part of
the domicile became more pronounced, the gate in the palings clicking
incessantly. The party was to be an early one, and all the guests
were assembled long before it was dark. Yeobright went down the back
staircase and into the heath by another path than that in front,
intending to walk in the open air till the party was over, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) would
return to wish Thomasin and her (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) husband good-bye as they departed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
steps were insensibly bent towards Mistover by the path that he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) had
followed on that terrible morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) learnt the strange news from
Susan's boy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) did not turn aside to the cottage, but pushed on to an eminence,
whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) could see over the whole quarter that had once been Eustacia's
home. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) stood observing the darkening scene somebody came up.
Clym, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) but dimly, would have let him (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) pass silently, had not
the pedestrian, who was Charley, recognized the young man and spoken to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley, I have not seen you for a length of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said Yeobright. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you often walk this way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>the lad replied. <div class="bookquote">``I don't often come outside the bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were not at the Maypole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>said Charley, in the same listless tone. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care for that
sort of thing now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You rather liked Miss Eustacia, didn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>Yeobright gently asked.
Eustacia had frequently told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) of Charley's romantic attachment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very much. Ah, I wish--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish, Mr. Yeobright, you could give me something to keep that once
belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>)--if you don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very happy to. It will give me very great pleasure, Charley.
Let me think what I have of hers that you would like. But come with me
to the house, and I'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked towards Blooms-End together. When they reached the front it
was dark, and the shutters were closed, so that nothing of the interior
could be seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come round this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``My entrance is at the back for the
present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The two went round and ascended the crooked stair in darkness till
Clym's sitting-room on the upper floor was reached, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) lit a
candle, Charley entering gently behind. Yeobright searched his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) desk,
and taking out a sheet of tissue-paper unfolded from it two or three
undulating locks of raven hair, which fell over the paper like black
streams. From these he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) selected one, wrapped it up, and gave it to the
lad, whose eyes had filled with tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) kissed the packet, put it in
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) pocket, and said in a voice of emotion, <div class="bookquote">``O, Mr. Clym, how good you
are to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go a little way with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. And amid the noise of
merriment from below they descended. Their path to the front led them
close to a little side window, whence the rays of candles streamed
across the shrubs. The window, being screened from general observation
by the bushes, had been left unblinded, so that a person in this private
nook could see all that was going on within the room which contained
the wedding guests, except in so far as vision was hindered by the green
antiquity of the panes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charley, what are they doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``My sight is weaker again
tonight, and the glass of this window is not good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) own eyes, which were rather blurred with moisture, and
stepped closer to the casement. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Venn is asking Christian Cantle to
sing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``and Christian is moving about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) chair as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) were much frightened at the question, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) father has struck up a
stave instead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I can hear the old man's voice,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym. <div class="bookquote">``So there's to be no
dancing, I suppose. And is Thomasin in the room? I see something moving
in front of the candles that resembles her (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) shape, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) do seem happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is red in the face, and laughing at
something Fairway has said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>). O my!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What noise was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Venn is so tall that he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) head against the beam in gieing
a skip as he (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) passed under. Mrs. Venn has run up quite frightened and now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)'s put her (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) head to feel if there's a lump. And now they
be all laughing again as if nothing had happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do any of them seem to care about my not being there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Clym asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not a bit in the world. Now they are all holding up their glasses
and drinking somebody's health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if it is mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, `tis Mr. and Mrs. Venn's, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is making a hearty sort of
speech. There--now Mrs. Venn has got up, and is going away to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>)
things, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they haven't concerned themselves about me, and it is quite right
they should not. It is all as it should be, and Thomasin at least is
happy. We will not stay any longer now, as they will soon be coming out
to go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) accompanied the lad into the heath on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) way home, and, returning
alone to the house a quarter of an hour later, found Venn and Thomasin
ready to start, all the guests having departed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Venn</b></font>) absence. The
wedded pair took their seats in the four-wheeled dogcart which Venn's
head milker and handy man had driven from Stickleford to fetch them in;
little Eustacia and the nurse were packed securely upon the open flap
behind; and the milker, on an ancient overstepping pony, whose shoes
clashed like cymbals at every tread, rode in the rear, in the manner of
a body-servant of the last century.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we leave you in absolute possession of your own house again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomasin/Yeobright/Thomasin Yeobright</b></font>)</div>said
Thomasin as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) bent down to wish her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) cousin good night. <div class="bookquote">``It will be
rather lonely for you, Clym, after the hubbub we have been making.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, that's no inconvenience,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Clym, smiling rather sadly. And then
the party drove off and vanished in the night shades, and Yeobright
entered the house. The ticking of the clock was the only sound that
greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), for not a soul remained; Christian, who acted as cook,
valet, and gardener to Clym, sleeping at his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) father's house. Yeobright
sat down in one of the vacant chairs, and remained in thought a long
time. His (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) mother's old chair was opposite; it had been sat in that
evening by those who had scarcely remembered that it ever was hers. But
to Clym she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was almost a presence there, now as always. Whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was in other people's memories, in his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was the sublime saint whose
radiance even his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) tenderness for Eustacia could not obscure. But his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>)
heart was heavy, that Mother had NOT crowned him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) in the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>)
espousals and in the day of the gladness of his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) heart. And events had
borne out the accuracy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) judgment, and proved the devotedness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) care. He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) should have heeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) for Eustacia's sake even more than
for his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``It was all my fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``O, my mother, my
mother! would to God that I could live my life again, and endure for you
what you endured for me!''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On the Sunday after this wedding an unusual sight was to be seen on
Rainbarrow. From a distance there simply appeared to be a motionless
figure standing on the top of the tumulus, just as Eustacia had stood on
that lonely summit some two years and a half before. But now it was fine
warm weather, with only a summer breeze blowing, and early afternoon
instead of dull twilight. Those who ascended to the immediate
neighbourhood of the Barrow perceived that the erect form in the centre,
piercing the sky, was not really alone. Round him (<font color='blue'><b>Eustacia</b></font>) upon the slopes of the
Barrow a number of heathmen and women were reclining or sitting at their
ease. They listened to the words of the man in their midst, who was
preaching, while they abstractedly pulled heather, stripped ferns, or
tossed pebbles down the slope. This was the first of a series of moral
lectures or Sermons on the Mount, which were to be delivered from the
same place every Sunday afternoon as long as the fine weather lasted.

<p/>The commanding elevation of Rainbarrow had been chosen for two reasons:
first, that it occupied a central position among the remote cottages
around; secondly, that the preacher thereon could be seen from all
adjacent points as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) arrived at his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) post, the view of him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) being
thus a convenient signal to those stragglers who wished to draw near.
The speaker was bareheaded, and the breeze at each waft gently lifted
and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) hair, somewhat too thin for a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) years, these
still numbering less than thirty-three. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) wore a shade over his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) eyes,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) face was pensive and lined; but, though these bodily features
were marked with decay there was no defect in the tones of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) voice,
which were rich, musical, and stirring. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) stated that his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) discourses to
people were to be sometimes secular, and sometimes religious, but never
dogmatic; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) texts would be taken from all kinds of books.
This afternoon the words were as follows:--

<p/>```And the king rose up to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), and bowed himself unto her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), and sat
down on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) right hand. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, I desire one small
petition of thee; I pray thee say me not nay. And the king said unto
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Ask, on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.'''


<p/>Yeobright had, in fact, found his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) vocation in the career of an itinerant
open-air preacher and lecturer on morally unimpeachable subjects; and
from this day he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) laboured incessantly in that office, speaking not only
in simple language on Rainbarrow and in the hamlets round, but in a more
cultivated strain elsewhere--from the steps and porticoes of town halls,
from market-crosses, from conduits, on esplanades and on wharves, from
the parapets of bridges, in barns and outhouses, and all other such
places in the neighbouring Wessex towns and villages. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) left alone
creeds and systems of philosophy, finding enough and more than enough
to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) tongue in the opinions and actions common to all good men.
Some believed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and some believed not; some said that his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) words were
commonplace, others complained of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) want of theological doctrine;
while others again remarked that it was well enough for a man to take to
preaching who could not see to do anything else. But everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
kindly received, for the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life had become generally known.
