 (<font color='red'><b>Kipling</b></font>)</div><p/>A STORY OF THE GRAND BANKS

<p/>By Rudyard Kipling




<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>The weather door of the smoking-room had been left open to the North
Atlantic fog, as the big liner rolled and lifted, whistling to warn the
fishing-fleet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That Cheyne boy's the biggest nuisance aboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said a man in a frieze
overcoat, shutting the door with a bang. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) isn't wanted here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)'s
too fresh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A white-haired German reached for a sandwich, and grunted between
bites: <div class="bookquote">``I know der breed. Ameriga is full of dot kind. I dell you you
should imbort ropes' ends free under your dariff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw! There isn't any real harm to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)'s more to be pitied than
anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>a man from New York drawled, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay at full length along
the cushions under the wet skylight. <div class="bookquote">``They've dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) around from
hotel to hotel ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) was a kid. I was talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) mother
this morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s a lovely lady, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) don't pretend to manage him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)'s going to Europe to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) education.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Education isn't begun yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>This a Philadelphian</b></font>)</div>This was a Philadelphian, curled up in a
corner. <div class="bookquote">``That boy gets two hundred a month pocket-money, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told me. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
isn't sixteen either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Railroads, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, aind't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the German</b></font>)</div>said the German.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yep. That and mines and lumber and shipping. Built one place at San
Diego, the old man has; another at Los Angeles; owns half a dozen
railroads, half the lumber on the Pacific slope, and lets his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) wife
spend the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Philadelphian</b></font>)</div>the Philadelphian went on lazily. <div class="bookquote">``The West don't
suit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) just tracks around with the boy and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nerves,
trying to find out what'll amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I guess. Florida, Adirondacks,
Lakewood, Hot Springs, New York, and round again. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) isn't much more
than a second-hand hotel clerk now. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s finished in Europe he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll
be a holy terror.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with the old man attending to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personally?''  (<font color='red'><b>the frieze ulster</b></font>)</div>said
a voice from the frieze ulster.

<p/>``Old man's piling up the rocks. ``Don't want to be disturbed, I guess.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll find out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) error a few years from now. <div class="bookquote">``Pity, because there's a
heap of good in the boy if you could get at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mit a rope's end; mit a rope's end!''  (<font color='red'><b>the German</b></font>)</div>growled the German.

<p/>Once more the door banged, and a slight, slim-built boy perhaps fifteen
years old, a half-smoked cigarette hanging from one corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
mouth, leaned in over the high footway. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pasty yellow complexion did
not show well on a person of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) years, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) look was a mixture of
irresolution, bravado, and very cheap smartness. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was dressed in a
cherry-coloured blazer, knickerbockers, red stockings, and bicycle
shoes, with a red flannel cap at the back of the head. After whistling
between his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) teeth, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyed the company, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said in a loud, high
voice: <div class="bookquote">``Say, it's thick outside. You can hear the fish-boats squawking
all around us. Say, wouldn't it be great if we ran down one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut the door, Harvey,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the New Yorker. <div class="bookquote">``Shut the door and stay
outside. You're not wanted here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who'll stop me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered deliberately. ``Did you pay for my
passage, Mister Martin? <div class="bookquote">``Guess I've as good right here as the next man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) picked up some dice from a checker-board and began throwing, right
hand against left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, gen`elmen, this is deader'n mud. Can't we make a game of poker
between us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cigarette, swung his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) legs, and
drummed on the table with rather dirty fingers. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pulled out a
roll of bills as if to count them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's your mamma this afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>a man said. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) at
lunch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) state-room, I guess. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'s `most always sick on the ocean. I'm
going to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>). I
don't go down more 'n I can avoid. It makes me feel mysterious to pass
that butler's-pantry place. Say, this is the first time I've been on
the ocean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't apologise, Harvey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's apologising? This is the first time I've crossed the ocean,
gen`elmen, and, except the first day, I haven't been sick one little
bit. No, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist with a triumphant bang, wetted
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger, and went on counting the bills.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're a high-grade machine, with the writing in plain sight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Philadelphian</b></font>)</div>the
Philadelphian yawned. <div class="bookquote">``You'll blossom into a credit to your country if
you don't take care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it. I'm an American--first, last, and all the time. I'll show
'em that when I strike Europe. Pif! My cig's out. I can't smoke the
truck the steward sells. Any gen`elman got a real Turkish cig on him (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The engineer</b></font>)</div><p/>The chief engineer entered for a moment, red, smiling, and wet. <div class="bookquote">``Say,
Mac,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>cried Harvey, cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``how are we hitting it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vara much in the ordinary way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the grave reply. <div class="bookquote">``The young are as
polite as ever to their elders, an' their elders are e`en tryin' to
appreciate it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A low chuckle came from a corner. The German opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) cigar-case and
handed a skinny black cigar to Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dot is der broper apparatus to smoke, my young friendt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You
vill dry it? Yes? Den you vill be efer so happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey lit the unlovely thing with a flourish: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was
getting on in grown-up society.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would take more 'n this to keel me over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said, ignorant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
was lighting that terrible article, a Wheeling `stogie'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dot we shall bresently see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the German</b></font>)</div>said the German. <div class="bookquote">``Where are we now, Mr.
Mactonal'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just there or thereabouts, Mr. Schaefer,''  (<font color='red'><b>the engineer</b></font>)</div>said the engineer.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll be on the Grand Bank to-night; but in a general way o' speakin',
we're all among the fishing-fleet now. We've shaved three dories an'
near skelped the boom off a Frenchman since noon, an' that's close
sailin', ye may say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You like my cigar, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>the German</b></font>)</div>the German asked, for Harvey's eyes were full
of tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fine, full flavour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) answered through shut teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Guess we've
slowed down a little, haven't we? I'll skip out and see what the log
says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might if I vhas you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the German</b></font>)</div>said the German.

<p/>Harvey staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was very
unhappy; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) saw the deck-steward lashing chairs together, and,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had boasted before the man that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was never seasick, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
pride made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) go aft to the second-saloon deck at the stern, which was
finished in a turtle-back. The deck was deserted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) crawled to the
extreme end of it, near the flagpole. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) doubled up in limp
agony, for the Wheeling <div class="bookquote">``stogie''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>joined with the surge and jar of the
screw to sieve out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) soul. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) head swelled; sparks of fire danced
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) eyes; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) body seemed to lose weight, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) heels
wavered in the breeze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was fainting from seasickness, and a roll of
the ship tilted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) over the rail on to the smooth lip of the
turtle-back. Then a low, grey mother-wave swung out of the fog, tucked
Harvey under one arm, so to speak, and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) off and away to
leeward; the great green closed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) went quietly to sleep.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was roused by the sound of a dinner-horn such as they used to blow
at a summer-school he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had once attended in the Adirondacks. Slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was Harvey Cheyne, drowned and dead in mid-ocean,
but was too weak to fit things together. A new smell filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)
nostrils; wet and clammy chills ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) back, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) was
helplessly full of salt water. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) perceived
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) was still on the top of the sea, for it was running round him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)
in silver-coloured hills, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) was lying on a pile of half-dead fish,
looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>thought the boy. <div class="bookquote">``I'm dead, sure enough, and this thing
is in charge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) groaned, and the figure turned its head, showing a pair of little
gold rings half hidden in curly black hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha! You feel some pretty well now'?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it said. <div class="bookquote">``Lie still so: we trim
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a jerk</b></font>)</div><p/>With a swift jerk he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) sculled the flickering boat-head on to a foamless
sea that lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) twenty full feet, only to slide her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) into a glassy
pit beyond. But this mountain-climbing did not interrupt blue-jersey's
talk. <div class="bookquote">``Fine good job, I say, that I catch you. Eh, wha-at? Better good
job, I say, your boat not catch me. How you come to fall out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey; <div class="bookquote">``sick, and couldn't help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just in time I blow my horn, and your boat she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) yaw a little. Then I
see you come all down. Eh, wha-at? I think you are cut into baits by
the screw, but you dreeft--dreeft to me, and I make a big fish of you.
So you shall not die this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, who could not see that life was particularly
safe where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lay.

<p/>``You are with me in the dory--Manuel my name, and I come from schooner
<div class="bookquote">``We're Here' of Gloucester. I live to Gloucester. By-and-by we get
supper. Eh, wha-at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of cast-iron, for, not
content with blowing through a big conch-shell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) must needs stand up
to it, swaying with the sway of the flat-bottomed dory, and send a
grinding, thuttering shriek through the fog. How long this
entertainment lasted, Harvey could not remember, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lay back
terrified at the sight of the smoking swells. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) heard a gun
and a horn and shouting. Something bigger than the dory, but quite as
lively, loomed alongside. Several voices talked at once; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was dropped
into a dark, heaving hole, where men in oilskins gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) a hot drink
and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) clothes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) fell asleep.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) waked he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) listened for the first breakfast-bell on the steamer,
wondering why his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) stateroom had grown so small. Turning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) looked into
a narrow, triangular cave, lit by a lamp hung against a huge square
beam. A three-cornered table within arm's reach ran from the angle of
the bows to the foremast. At the after end, behind a well-used Plymouth
stove, sat a boy about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own age, with a flat red face and a pair of
twinkling grey eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was dressed in a blue jersey and high rubber
boots. Several pairs of the same sort of foot-wear, an old cap, and
some worn-out woolen socks lay on the floor, and black and yellow
oilskins swayed to and fro beside the bunks. The place was packed as
full of smells as a bale is of cotton. The oilskins had a peculiarly
thick flavour of their own which made a sort of background to the
smells of fried fish, burnt grease, paint, pepper, and stale tobacco;
but these, again, were all hooped together by one encircling smell of
ship and salt water. Harvey saw with disgust that there were no sheets
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) bed-place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was lying on a piece of dingy ticking full of
lumps and nubbles. Then, too, the boat's motion was not that of a
steamer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was neither sliding nor rolling, but rather wriggling
herself about in a silly, aimless way, like a colt at the end of a
halter. Water-noises ran by close to his (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) ear, and beams creaked and
whined about him (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>). All these things made him (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) grunt despairingly and
think of his (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Feelin' better?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, with a grin. <div class="bookquote">``Hev some coffee?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>)
brought a tin cup full, and sweetened it with molasses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is n't there milk?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, looking round the dark double tier of
bunks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) expected to find a cow there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy. ``Ner there ain't likely to be till `baout
mid-September. <div class="bookquote">``Tain't bad coffee. I made it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey drank in silence, and the boy handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) a plate full of pieces
of crisp fried pork, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) ate ravenously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've dried your clothes. Guess they've shrunk some,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.
<div class="bookquote">``They ain't our style much--none of 'em. Twist round an' see ef you're
hurt any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey stretched himself in every direction, but could not report any
injuries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy said heartily. <div class="bookquote">``Fix yerself an' go on deck. Dad
wants to see you. I'm his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) son,--Dan, they call me,--an' I'm cook's
helper an' everything else aboard that's too dirty for the men. There
ain't no boy here `cep' me sence Otto went overboard--an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>) was only a
Dutchy, an' twenty year old at that. How'd you come to fall off in a
dead flat ca'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'''Twasn't a calm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, sulkily. <div class="bookquote">``It was a gale, and I was
seasick. Guess I must have rolled over the rail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a little common swell yes`day an' last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.
<div class="bookquote">``But ef thet's your notion of a gale--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whistled. <div class="bookquote">``You'll know
more `fore you're through. Hurry! Dad's waitin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>Like many other unfortunate young people, Harvey had never in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
life received a direct order--never, at least, without long, and
sometimes tearful, explanations of the advantages of obedience and the
reasons for the request. Mrs. Cheyne lived in fear of breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
spirit, which, perhaps, was the reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) herself walked on the
edge of nervous prostration. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) could not see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) should be expected
to hurry for any man's pleasure, and said so. <div class="bookquote">``Your dad can come down
here if he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s so anxious to talk to me. I want him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) to take me to New
York right away. It'll pay him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) eyes, as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Say, dad!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) shouted up the fo`c`sle hatch, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) says you kin slip
down an' see him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) ef you're anxious that way. <div class="bookquote">``Hear, dad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>The answer came back in the deepest voice Harvey had ever heard from a
human chest: <div class="bookquote">``Quit foolin', Dan, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan sniggered, and threw Harvey his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) warped bicycle shoes. There was
something in the tones on the deck that made the boy dissemble his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
extreme rage and console himself with the thought of gradually
unfolding the tale of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's wealth on the voyage
home. This rescue would certainly make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a hero among his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friends for
life. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hoisted himself on deck up a perpendicular ladder, and
stumbled aft, over a score of obstructions, to where a small,
thick-set, clean-shaven man with grey eyebrows sat on a step that led
up to the quarter-deck. The swell had passed in the night, leaving a
long, oily sea, dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen
fishing-boats. Between them lay little black specks, showing where the
dories were out fishing. The schooner, with a triangular riding-sail on
the mainmast, played easily at anchor, and except for the man by the
cabin-roof--<div class="bookquote">``house''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>they call it--she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was deserted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mornin'--good afternoon, I should say. You've nigh slep' the clock
around, young feller,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mornin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) did not like being called <div class="bookquote">``young feller'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>;
and, as one rescued from drowning, expected sympathy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) mother
suffered agonies whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) feet wet; but this mariner did not
seem excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naow let's hear all abaout it. It's quite providential, first an'
last, fer all concerned. What might be your name? Where from -LRB-we
mistrust it's Noo York-RRB-, an' where baound -LRB-we mistrust it's Europe-RRB-?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) name, the name of the steamer, and a short history of
the accident, winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to
New York, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father would pay anything any one chose to name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the shaven man, quite unmoved by the end of Harvey's
speech. <div class="bookquote">``I can't say we think special of any man, or boy even, that
falls overboard from that kind o' packet in a flat ca'am. Least of all
when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excuse is thet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s seasick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>cried Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``D'you suppose I'd fall overboard into your

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Not knowin' what your notions o' fun may be, I can't rightly say,
young feller. But if I was you, I wouldn't call the boat which, under
Providence, was the means o' savin' ye, names. In the first place, it's
blame irreligious. In the second, it's annoyin' to my feelin's--an' I'm

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know and I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``I'm grateful enough for

the sooner you take me back to New York the better it'll pay you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meanin'--haow?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously
mild blue eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dollars and cents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, delighted to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was making
an impression. <div class="bookquote">``Cold dollars and cents.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) thrust a hand into a
pocket, and threw out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) stomach a little, which was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) way of being
grand. <div class="bookquote">``You've done the best day's work you ever did in your life when

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)'s bin favoured,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you don't know who Harvey Cheyne is, you don't know
much--that's all. Now turn her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) around and let's hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey had a notion that the greater part of America was filled with
people discussing and envying his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father's dollars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mebbe I do, an' mebbe I don't. Take a reef in your stummick, young
feller. It's full o' my vittles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey heard a chuckle from Dan, who was pretending to be busy by the
stump-foremast, and the blood rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``We'll pay for that
too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``When do you suppose we shall get to New York?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't use Noo York any. Ner Boston. We may see Eastern Point about

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten dollars! Why, see here, I--''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey dived into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) pocket for the
wad of bills. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) brought up was a soggy packet of cigarettes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not lawful currency, an' bad for the lungs. Heave 'em overboard, young

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's been stolen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>cried Harvey, hotly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred and thirty-four dollars--all stolen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, hunting
wildly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) pockets. <div class="bookquote">``Give them back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A curious change flitted across old Troop's hard face. <div class="bookquote">``What might you
have been doin' at your time o' life with one hundred an' thirty-four
dollars, young feller?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was part of my pocket-money--for a month.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>This Harvey thought
would be a knockdown blow, and it was--indirectly.

<p/>Oh! One hundred and thirty-four dollars is only part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
pocket-money--for one month only! You don't remember hittin' anything
when you fell over, do you? Crack ag`in' a stanchion, le's say. Old man
Hasken o' the <div class="bookquote">``East Wind'' (<font color='red'><b>Hasken</b></font>)</div>--Troop seemed to be talking to himself--``he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>)
tripped on a hatch an' butted the mainmast with his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) head--hardish.
``Baout three weeks afterwards, old man Hasken he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would hev it that the
<div class="bookquote">``East Wind''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was a commerce-destroyin' man-o'-war, an' so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared
war on Sable Island because it was Bridish, an' the shoals run aout too

the rest o' the trip, an' now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s to home in Essex playin' with little
rag dolls.''

<p/>Harvey choked with rage, but Troop went on consolingly: <div class="bookquote">``We're sorry
fer you. We're very sorry fer you--an' so young. We won't say no more
abaout the money, I guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Course you won't. You stole it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suit yourself. We stole it ef it's any comfort to you. Naow, abaout

workin' fer our bread. We don't see the ha'af of a hundred dollars a

somewheres abaout the first weeks o' September.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--but it's May now, and I can't stay here doin' nothing just

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said
Harvey, with a vicious nod, murmuring vague threats about <div class="bookquote">``piracy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>at
which Troop almost--not quite--smiled.

<p/>``Excep' talk. I'd forgot that. You ain't asked to talk more'n you've a

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha-ow?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troop, the iron face darkening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How? You know how, well enough. On top of all that, you want me to do

I tell you I will not. You hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Troop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while,
as Harvey harangued fiercely all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hsh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``I'm figurin' out my responsibilities in my own

Troop meditated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seems kinder unneighbourly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said at last, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) eye travelling down
to Harvey. ``I don't blame you, not a mite, young feller, nor you won't

him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) serenely.

<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I warned ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looks like justice, this, don't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) outraged

<p/>``Thet's nothin'. Lets the shore blood outer you. Dad did it for yer
health. Say, though, I can't have dealin's with a man that thinks me or
dad or any one on the ``We're Here's<div class="bookquote">'' a thief. We ain't any common
wharf-end crowd by any manner o' means. We're fishermen, an' we've
shipped together for six years an' more. Don't you make any mistake on
that! I told ye dad don't let me swear. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) calls 'em vain oaths, and
pounds me; but ef I could say what you said `baout your pap an' his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)

using the very same words ez you used jest now, neither me nor dad--an'

anythin' `baout the money. Thet's my say. Naow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>The bloodletting had certainly cleared Harvey's brain, and maybe the
loneliness of the sea had something to do with it. <div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) looked down confusedly. <div class="bookquote">''`Seems to me that for a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might have thought about losing the bills that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey said,

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the cabin What d' you want o' him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) stepped, rather groggily, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
head was still singing, to the cabin steps, where the little
ship's clock hung in plain sight of the wheel. Troop, in the
chocolate-and-yellow painted cabin, was busy with a note-book and an
enormous black pencil, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) sucked hard from time to time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't acted quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) own
meekness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong naow?''  (<font color='red'><b>the skipper</b></font>)</div>said the skipper <div class="bookquote">``Walked into Dan, hev ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the skipper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it's about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm here to listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I--I'm here to take things back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, very quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``When a man's saved from drowning--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) gulped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ey? You'll make a man yet ef you go on this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) oughtn't begin by calling people names.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jest an' right--right an' jest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ghost</b></font>)</div>said Troop, with the ghost of a dry
smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I'm here to say I'm sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another big gulp.

<p/>Troop heaved himself slowly off the locker he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was sitting on and held
out an eleven-inch hand. <div class="bookquote">``I mistrusted `twould do you sights o' good;
an' this shows I weren't mistook in my jedgments.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A smothered chuckle
on deck caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">``I am very seldom mistook in my jedgments.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>The
eleven-inch hand closed on Harvey's, numbing it to the elbow. <div class="bookquote">``We'll

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're white,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, as Harvey regained the deck, flushed to the
tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean that way. I heard what dad said. When dad allows he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``Supper, o' course. Don't your stummick tell

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Guess I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, dolefully, looking at the tangle of ropes
and blocks overhead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s a daisy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, enthusiastically, misunderstanding the look.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait till our mainsail's bent, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) walks home with all her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) salt
wet. There's some work first, though.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) pointed down into the
darkness of the open main-hatch between the two masts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that for? It's all empty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You an' me an' a few more hev got to fill it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``That's where

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alive?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no. They're so's to be ruther dead--an' flat--an' salt. There's
a hundred hogshead o' salt in the bins; an' we hain't more'n covered

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are the fish, though?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`In the sea, they say; in the boats, we pray,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, quoting a
fisherman's proverb. <div class="bookquote">``You come in last night with `baout forty of 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) pointed to a sort of wooden pen just in front of the quarter-deck.

<p/>``You an' me we'll sluice that out when they're through. <div class="bookquote">``Send we'll hev
full pens to-night! I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) down ha'af a foot with fish waitin'

instid o' them, we was so sleepy. Yes, they're comin' in naow.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Dan
looked over the low bulwarks at half a dozen dories rowing towards them
over the shining, silky sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never seen the sea from so low down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``It's fine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The low sun made the water all purple and pinkish, with golden lights
on the barrels of the long swells, and blue and green mackerel shades
in the hollows. Each schooner in sight seemed to be pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) dories
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) by invisible strings, and the little black figures in the
tiny boats pulled like clockwork toys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They've struck on good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) half-shut eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Manuel
hain't room fer another fish. Low ez a lily-pad in still water, ain't
he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is Manuel? I don't see how you can tell 'em `way off, as you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Last boat to the south`ard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) f`und you last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan,
pointing. <div class="bookquote">``Manuel rows Portugoosey; ye can't mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>). East o'

saleratus, by the looks of him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>). East o' him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)--see how pretty they string
out all along with the humpy shoulders, is Long Jack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'s a Galway man
inhabitin' South Boston, where they all live mostly, an' mostly them
Galway men are good in a boat. North, away yonder--you'll hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) tune
up in a minute--is Tom Platt. Man-o'-war's man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on the old
Ohio--first of our navy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says, to go araound the Horn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) never
talks of much else, `cept when he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) sings, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) has fair fishin' luck.
There! What did I tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A melodious bellow stole across the water from the northern dory.
Harvey heard something about somebody's hands and feet being cold, and
then:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring forth the chart, the doleful chart;
See where them mountings meet!
The clouds are thick around their heads,
The mists around their feet.''


 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Full boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, with a chuckle. ``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) gives us <div class="bookquote">``O Captain' it's
toppin' full.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bellow continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And naow to thee, O Capting,
Most earnestly I pray
That they shall never bury me
In church or cloister grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Double game for Tom Platt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)'ll tell you all about the old Ohio

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What'll sting him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, getting interested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strawberries, mostly. Punkins, sometimes, an' sometimes lemons an'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to try to work, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey replied stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``Only it's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lay a-holt o' that tackle, then. Behind ye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey grabbed at a rope and long iron hook dangling from one of the
stays of the mainmast, while Dan pulled down another that ran from
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) called a <div class="bookquote">``topping-lift,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as Manuel drew alongside in his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)
loaded dory. The Portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that Harvey
learned to know well later, and a short-handled fork began to throw
fish into the pen on deck. <div class="bookquote">``Two hundred and thirty-one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Lay</b></font>) the hook,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, and Harvey ran it into Manuel's hands.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) slipped it through a loop of rope at the dory's bow, caught Dan's
tackle, hooked it to the stern-becket, and clambered into the schooner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pull!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>shouted Dan; and Harvey pulled, astonished to find how easily
the dory rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold on; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) don't nest in the crosstrees!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan laughed; and Harvey
held on, for the boat lay in the air above his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lower away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan shouted; and as Harvey lowered, Dan swayed the light
boat with one hand till it landed softly just behind the mainmast.
<div class="bookquote">``They don't weigh nothin' empty. Thet was right smart fer a passenger.
There's more trick to it in a sea-way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>said Manuel, holding out a brown hand. <div class="bookquote">``You are some pretty
well now? This time last night the fish they fish for you. Now you fish
for fish. Eh, wha-at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm--I'm ever so grateful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey stammered, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) unfortunate hand
stole to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) pocket once more, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had no money
to offer. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) knew Manuel better the mere thought of the mistake he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)
might have made would cover him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) with hot, uneasy blushes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) bunk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no to be thankful for to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>said Manuel. <div class="bookquote">``How shall I leave
you dreeft, dreeft all around the Banks? Now you are a fisherman eh,
wha-at? Ouh! Auh!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) bent backward and forward stiffly from the hips
to get the kinks out of himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not cleaned boat to-day. Too busy. They struck on queek. Danny,
my son, clean for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey moved forward at once. Here was something he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) could do for the
man who had saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) life.

<p/>Dan threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) a swab, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) leaned over the dory, mopping up the slime
clumsily, but with great good-will. <div class="bookquote">``Hike out the foot-boards; they
slide in them grooves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Swab 'em an' lay 'em down. Never let
a foot-board jam. Ye may want her (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) bad some day. Here's Long Jack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A stream of glittering fish flew into the pen from a dory alongside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Manuel, you take the tackle. I'll fix the tables. Harvey, clear
Manuel's boat. Long Jack's nestin' on the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) swabbing at the bottom of another dory just
above his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jest like the Injian puzzle-boxes, ain't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, as the one
boat dropped into the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Takes to ut like a duck to water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, a grizzly-chinned,
long-lipped Galway man, bending to and fro exactly as Manuel had done.
Disko in the cabin growled up the hatchway, and they could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)
suck his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) pencil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wan hunder an' forty-nine an' a half--bad luck to ye, Discobolus!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack. <div class="bookquote">``I'm murderin' meself to fill your pockuts. Slate ut
for a bad catch. The Portugee has bate me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Whack came another dory alongside, and more fish shot into the pen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two hundred and three. Let's look at the passenger!''  (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div>The speaker was
even larger than the Galway man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was made curious by a
purple cut running slantways from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left eye to the right corner of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>Not knowing what else to do, Harvey swabbed each dory as it came down,
pulled out the foot-boards, and laid them in the bottom of the boat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>)'s caught on good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man Platt</b></font>)</div>said the scarred man, who was Tom Platt,
watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) critically. <div class="bookquote">``There are two ways o' doin' everything. One's
fisher-fashion--any end first an' a slippery hitch over all--an' the
other's--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What we did on the old Ohio!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan interrupted, brushing into the knot
of men with a long board on legs. <div class="bookquote">``Git out o' here, Tom Platt, an'
leave me fix the tables.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) jammed one end of the board into two nicks in the bulwarks, kicked
out the leg, and ducked just in time to avoid a swinging blow from the
man-o'-war's man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' they did that on the Ohio, too, Danny. See?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt,
laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Guess they was swivel-eyed, then, fer it didn't git home, and I know

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Danny, ye lie on the cable an' sleep all day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack. <div class="bookquote">``You're

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) name's Harvey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, waving two strangely shaped knives, <div class="bookquote">``an'

the knives tastefully on the table, cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) head on one side, and
admired the effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's forty-two,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a small voice over-side, and there was a
roar of laughter as another voice answered, <div class="bookquote">``Then my luck's turned fer

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty-two or forty-five. I've lost count,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the small voice said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Penn an' Uncle Salters caountin' catch. This beats the circus any

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in--come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>roared Long Jack. <div class="bookquote">``It's wet out yondher, children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty-two, ye said.''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>This was Uncle Salters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll count again, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the voice replied meekly.

<p/>The two dories swung together and bunted into the schooner's side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Patience o' Jerusalem!''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>snapped Uncle Salters, backing water with a
splash. <div class="bookquote">``What possest a farmer like you to set foot in a boat beats me.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry, Mr. Salters. I came to sea on account of nervous

Salters. <div class="bookquote">``You count keerful, Penn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko Troop came out of the cabin. <div class="bookquote">``Salters, you pitch your fish in
naow at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) said in the tone of authority.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't spile the catch, dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Them two are on'y jest
beginnin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother av delight! He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s forkin' them wan by wan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>howled Long Jack, as
Uncle Salters got to work laboriously; the little man in the other dory
counting a line of notches on the gunwale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was last week's catch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) said, looking up plaintively, his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)
forefinger where he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) had left off.

<p/>Manuel nudged Dan, who darted to the after-tackle, and, leaning far
overside, slipped the hook into the stern-rope as Manuel made her (<font color='blue'><b>Troop</b></font>) fast
forward. The others pulled gallantly and swung the boat in--man, fish,
and all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One, two, four--nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt, counting with a practised eye.
<div class="bookquote">``Forty-seven. Penn, you're it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan let the after-tackle run, and slid
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) out of the stern on to the deck amid a torrent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) own fish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>roared Uncle Salters, bobbing by the waist. <div class="bookquote">``Hold on, I'm a
bit mixed in my caount.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) had no time to protest, but was hove inboard and treated like
<div class="bookquote">``Pennsylvania.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty-one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt. <div class="bookquote">``Beat by a farmer, Salters. An' you sech a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tweren't fair caount,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>), stumbling out of the pen; <div class="bookquote">``an' I'm
stung up all to pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) thick hands were puffy and mottled purply white.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some folks will find strawberry-bottom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, addressing the
newly risen moon, <div class="bookquote">``ef they hev to dive fer it, seems to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An' others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Salters, <div class="bookquote">``eats the fat o' the land in sloth,
an' mocks their own blood-kin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seat ye! Seat ye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>a voice Harvey had not heard called from the
fo`c`sle. Disko Troop, Tom Platt, Long Jack, and Salters went forward
on the word. Little Penn bent above his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) square deep-sea reel and the
tangled cod-lines; Manuel lay down full length on the deck, and Dan
dropped into the hold, where Harvey heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) banging casks with a
hammer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Salt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said, returning. <div class="bookquote">``Soon as we're through supper we git to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``I'm hungry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll be through in a minute. Sniff! She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) smells good to-night. Dad

today, ain't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) pointed at the pens piled high with cod. <div class="bookquote">``What
water did ye hev, Manuel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-fife father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Portuguese</b></font>)</div>said the Portuguese, sleepily. <div class="bookquote">``They strike on
good an' queek. Some day I show you, Harvey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>The moon was beginning to walk on the still sea before the elder men
came aft. The cook had no need to cry <div class="bookquote">``second half.''  (<font color='red'><b>The cook</b></font>)</div>Dan and Manuel
were down the hatch and at table ere Tom Platt, last and most
deliberate of the elders, had finished wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) mouth with the back
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) hand. Harvey followed Penn, and sat down before a tin pan of
cod's tongues and sounds, mixed with scraps of pork and fried potato, a
loaf of hot bread, and some black and powerful coffee. Hungry as they
were, they waited while <div class="bookquote">``Pennsylvania''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>solemnly asked a blessing. Then
they stoked in silence till Dan drew breath over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) tin cup and
demanded of Harvey how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) felt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Most full, but there's just room for another piece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The cook was a huge, jet-black negro, and, unlike all the negroes
Harvey had met, did not talk, contenting himself with smiles and
dumb-show invitations to eat more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, Harvey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, rapping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) fork on the table, <div class="bookquote">``it's jest
as I said. The young an' handsome men--like me an' Pennsy an' you an'
Manuel--we 're second ha'af, an' we eats when the first ha'af are
through. They're the old fish; and they're mean an' humpy, an' their
stummicks has to be humoured; so they come first, which they don't
deserve. Ain't that so, doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>The cook nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) talk?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Nough to git along. Not much o' anything we know. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) natural

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not Scotch,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said <div class="bookquote">``Pennsylvania.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is Gaelic. So I read in a book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Penn reads a heap. Most of what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) says is so--`cep' when it comes to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does your father just let them say how many they've caught without
checking them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes. Where's the sense of a man lyin' fer a few old cod?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was a man once lied for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) catch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>Manuel put in. <div class="bookquote">``Lied every day.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``None o' aour folk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frenchman of Anguille.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Them West Shore Frenchmen don't caount, anyway. Stands to reason
they can't caount. Ef you run acrost any of their soft hooks, Harvey,
you'll know why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, with an awful contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always more and never less,
Every time we come to dress,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Long</b></font>)</div><p/>Long Jack roared down the hatch, and the <div class="bookquote">``second ha'af''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>scrambled up at
once.

<p/>The shadow of the masts and rigging, with the never-furled riding-sail,
rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight; and the pile of
fish by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver. In the hold there
were tramplings and rumblings where Disko Troop and Tom Platt moved
among the salt-bins. Dan passed Harvey a pitchfork, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) to the
inboard end of the rough table, where Uncle Salters was drumming
impatiently with a knife-haft. A tub of salt water lay at his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You pitch to dad an' Tom Platt down the hatch, an' take keer Uncle
Salters don't cut yer eye out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, swinging himself into the
hold. <div class="bookquote">``I'll pass salt below.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn Manuel</b></font>)</div><p/>Penn and Manuel stood knee-deep among cod in the pen, flourishing drawn
knives. Long Jack, a basket at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) feet and mittens on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands, faced
Uncle Salters at the table, and Harvey stared at the pitchfork and the
tub.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>shouted Manuel, stooping to the fish, and bringing one up with a
finger under its gill and a finger in its eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) laid it on the edge
of the pen; the knife-blade glimmered with a sound of tearing, and the
fish, slit from throat to vent, with a nick on either side of the neck,
dropped at Long Jack's feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, with a scoop of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mittened hand. The cod's
liver dropped in the basket. Another wrench and scoop sent the head and
offal flying, and the empty fish slid across to Uncle Salters, who
snorted fiercely. There was another sound of tearing, the backbone flew
over the bulwarks, and the fish, headless, gutted, and open, splashed
in the tub, sending the salt water into Harvey's astonished mouth.
After the first yell, the men were silent. The cod moved along as
though they were alive, and long ere Harvey had ceased wondering at the
miraculous dexterity of it all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) tub was full.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pitch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>grunted Uncle Salters, without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) head, and Harvey
pitched the fish by twos and threes down the hatch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi! Pitch 'em bunchy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>shouted Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Don't scatter! Uncle Salters is
the best splitter in the fleet. Watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) book!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the round uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Indeed, it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting
magazine pages against time. Manuel's body, cramped over from the hips,
stayed like a statue; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) long arms grabbed the fish without
ceasing. Little Penn toiled valiantly, but it was easy to see he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) was
weak. Once or twice Manuel found time to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) without breaking the
chain of supplies, and once Manuel howled because he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) had caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)
finger in a Frenchman's hook. These hooks are made of soft metal, to be
rebent after use; but the cod very often get away with them and are
hooked again elsewhere; and that is one of the many reasons why the
Gloucester boats despise the Frenchmen.

<p/>Down below, the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh
sounded like the whirring of a grindstone--a steady undertune to the
<div class="bookquote">``click-nick''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>of the knives in the pen; the wrench and schloop of torn
heads, dropped liver, and flying offal; the <div class="bookquote">``caraaah''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>of Uncle
Salters's knife scooping away backbones; and the flap of wet, opened
bodies falling into the tub.

<p/>At the end of an hour Harvey would have given the world to rest; for
fresh, wet cod weigh more than you would think, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) back ached with
the steady pitching. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) felt for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) life that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
was one of a working gang of men, took pride in the thought, and held
on sullenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knife oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>shouted Uncle Salters, at last. Penn doubled up, gasping
among the fish, Manuel bowed back and forth to supple himself, and Long
Jack leaned over the bulwarks. The cook appeared, noiseless as a black
shadow, collected a mass of backbones and heads, and retreated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blood-ends for breakfast an' head-chowder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, smacking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knife oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>repeated Uncle Salters, waving the flat, curved splitter's
weapon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look by your foot, Harve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>cried Dan, below.

<p/>Harvey saw half a dozen knives stuck in a cleat in the hatch combing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) dealt these around, taking over the dulled ones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Water!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Disko Troop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scuttle-butt's for`ard, an' the dipper's alongside. Hurry, Harve,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was back in a minute with a big dipperful of stale brown water which
tasted like nectar, and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are cod,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``They ain't Damarskus figs, Tom Platt, nor
yet silver bars. I've told you that every single time sence we've
sailed together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A matter o' seven seasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>returned Tom Platt, coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Good stowin's
good stowin' all the same, an' there's a right an' a wrong way o'
stowin' ballast even. If you'd ever seen four hundred ton o' iron set
into the--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>With a yell from Manuel the work began again, and never stopped
till the pen was empty. The instant the last fish was down, Disko Troop
rolled aft to the cabin with his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) brother; Manuel and Long Jack went
forward; Tom Platt only waited long enough to slide home the hatch ere
he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) too disappeared. In half a minute Harvey heard deep snores in the
cabin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was staring blankly at Dan and Penn..

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did a little better that time, Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>said Penn, whose eyelids were
heavy with sleep. <div class="bookquote">``But I think it is my duty to help clean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Wouldn't hev your conscience fer a thousand quintal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Turn
in, Penn.. You've no call to do boy's work. Draw a bucket, Harvey. Oh,
Penn, dump these in the gurry-butt `fore you sleep. Kin you keep awake
that long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div><p/>Penn took up the heavy basket of fish-livers, emptied them into a cask
with a hinged top lashed by the fo`c`sle; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) too dropped out of
sight in the cabin.

<p/>``Boys clean up after dressin' down, an' first watch in ca'am weather is
boy's watch on the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Dan sluiced the pen energetically,
unshipped the table, set it up to dry in the moonlight, ran the red
knife-blades through a wad of oakum, and began to sharpen them on a
tiny grindstone, as Harvey threw offal and backbones overboard under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) direction.

<p/>At the first splash a silvery-white ghost rose bolt upright from the
oily water and sighed a weird whistling sigh. Harvey started back with
a shout, but Dan only laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Grampus,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Beggin' fer
fish-heads. They up-eend thet way when they're hungry. Breath on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
like the doleful tombs, hain't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A horrible stench of decayed fish
filled the air as the pillar of white sank, and the water bubbled
oilily. ``Hain't ye never seen a grampus up-eend before? You'll see 'em
by hundreds `fore ye're through. Say, it's good to hev a boy aboard
again. Otto was too old, an' a Dutchy at that. Him (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>) an' me we fought
consid`ble. <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't ha' keered fer thet ef he (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>)'d hed a Christian
tongue in his (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>) head. Sleepy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead sleepy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, nodding forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Mustn't sleep on watch. Rouse up an' see ef our anchor-light's bright
an' shinin'. You're on watch now, Harve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>``Pshaw! What's to hurt us? Bright's day. Sn-orrr!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jest when things happen, dad says. Fine weather's good sleepin', an'
`fore you know, mebbe, you're cut in two by a liner, an' seventeen
brass-bound officers, all gen`elmen, lift their hand to it that your
lights was aout an' there was a thick fog. Harve, I've kinder took to
you, but ef you nod onct more I'll lay into you with a rope's end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Banks</b></font>)</div><p/>The moon, who sees many strange things on the Banks, looked down on a
slim youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey, staggering around the
cluttered decks of a seventy-ton schooner, while behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>), waving a
knotted rope, walked, after the manner of an executioner, a boy who
yawned and nodded between the blows he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dealt.

<p/>The lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly, the riding-sail slatted a
little in the shifts of the light wind, the windlass creaked, and the
miserable procession continued. Harvey expostulated, threatened,
whimpered, and at last wept outright, while Dan, the words clotting on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) tongue, spoke of the beauty of watchfulness, and slashed away with
the rope's end, punishing the dories as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) hit Harvey. At last
the clock in the cabin struck ten, and upon the tenth stroke little
Penn crept on deck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) found two boys in two tumbled heaps side by side
on the main-hatch, so deeply asleep that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) actually rolled them to
their berths.



<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>It was the forty-fathom slumber that clears the soul and eye and heart,
and sends you to breakfast ravening. They emptied a big tin dish of
juicy fragments of fish--the blood-ends the cook had collected
overnight. They cleaned up the plates and pans of the elder mess, who
were out fishing, sliced pork for the midday meal, swabbed down the
fo`c`sle, filled the lamps, drew coal and water for the cook, and
investigated the fore-hold, where the boat's stores were stacked. It
was another perfect day--soft, mild, and clear; and Harvey breathed to
the very bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lungs.

<p/>More schooners had crept up in the night, and the long blue seas were
full of sails and dories. Far away on the horizon, the smoke of some
liner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) hull invisible, smudged the blue, and to eastward a big
ship's topgallantsails, just lifting, made a square nick in it. Disko
Troop was smoking by the roof of the cabin--one eye on the craft
around, and the other on the little fly at the mainmast-head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When dad kerflummoxes that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, in a whisper, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s doin'
some high-line thinkin' fer all hands. I'll lay my wage an' share we'll
make berth soon. Dad he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) knows the cod, an' the fleet they know dad
knows. <div class="bookquote">``See 'em comin' up one by one, lookin' fer nothin' in
particular, o' course, but scrowgin' on us all the time? There's the
Prince Leboa; she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s a Chat-ham boat. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s crep' up sence last night.
An' see that big one with a patch in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) foresail an' a new jib? She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s
the Carrie Pitman from West Chatham. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) won't keep her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) canvas long on
less her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) luck's changed since last season. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) don't do much `cep'
drift. There ain't an anchor made'll hold her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)... When the smoke
puffs up in little rings like that, dad's studyin' the fish. Ef we
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) now, he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'ll git mad. Las' time I did, he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) jest took an' hove
a boot at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko Troop stared forward, the pipe between his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) teeth, with eyes that
saw nothing. As his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) son said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was studying the fish--pitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
knowledge and experience on the Banks against the roving cod in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) own
sea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) accepted the presence of the inquisitive schooners on the
horizon as a compliment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) powers. But now that it was paid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
wished to draw away and make his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) berth alone, till it was time to go up
to the Virgin and fish in the streets of that roaring town upon the
waters. So Disko Troop thought of recent weather, and gales, currents,
food-supplies, and other domestic arrangements, from the point of view
of a twenty-pound cod; was, in fact, for an hour a cod himself, and
looked remarkably like one. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) removed the pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) teeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, <div class="bookquote">``we've done our chores. Can't we go overside a piece?
It's good catch-in' weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in that cherry-coloured rig ner them ha'afbaked brown shoes. Give

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dad's pleased--that settles it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, delightedly, dragging
Harvey into the cabin, while Troop pitched a key down the steps. <div class="bookquote">``Dad

keerless.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) rummaged through a locker, and in less than three minutes
Harvey was adorned with fisherman's rubber boots that came half up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
thigh, a heavy blue jersey well darned at the elbows, a pair of
flippers, and a sou`wester.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naow ye look somethin' like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Hurry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep nigh an' handy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troop, <div class="bookquote">``an' don't go visitin' raound the
fleet. Ef any one asks you what I'm cal`latin' to do, speak the
truth--fer ye don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hattie S./Hattie</b></font>)</div><p/>A little red dory, labelled Hattie S., lay astern of the schooner. Dan
hauled in the painter, and dropped lightly on to the bottom boards,
while Harvey tumbled clumsily after.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's no way o' gettin' into a boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Ef there was any sea
you'd go to the bottom, sure. You got to learn to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan fitted the thole-pins, took the forward thwart, and watched
Harvey's work. The boy had rowed, in a ladylike fashion, on the
Adirondack ponds; but there is a difference between squeaking pins and
well-balanced rowlocks--light sculls and stubby, eight-foot sea-oars.
They stuck in the gentle swell, and Harvey grunted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Short! Row short!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Ef you cramp your oar in any kind o' sea
you're liable to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) over. Ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a daisy? Mine, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The little dory was specklessly clean. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) bows lay a tiny anchor,
two jugs of water, and some seventy fathoms of thin, brown dory-roding.
A tin dinner-horn rested in cleats just under Harvey's right hand,
beside an ugly-looking maul, a short gaff, and a shorter wooden stick.
A couple of lines, with very heavy leads and double cod-hooks, all
neatly coiled on square reels, were stuck in their place by the gunwale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the sail and mast?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) hands were beginning
to blister.

<p/>Dan chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``Ye don't sail fishin'-dories much. Ye pull; but ye
needn't pull so hard. Don't you wish you owned her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess my father might give me one or two if I asked 'em,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey replied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had been too busy to think much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) family till
then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so. I forgot your dad's a millionaire. You don't act millionary
any, naow. But a dory an' craft an' gear'' (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>--Dan spoke as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) were
a whale-boat <div class="bookquote">``costs a heap. Think your dad `u'd give you one fer--fer a
pet like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't wonder. It would be `most the only thing I haven't stuck him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)
for yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must be an expensive kinder kid to home. Don't slitheroo thet way,
Harve. Short's the trick, because no sea's ever dead still, an' the
swells'll--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Crack! The loom of the oar kicked Harvey under the chin and knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
backward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was what I was goin' to say. I hed to learn too, but I wasn't
more than eight years old when I got my schoolin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) seat with aching jaws and a frown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No good gettin' mad at things, dad says. It's our own fault ef we
can't handle 'em, he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) says. Le's try here. Manuel'll give us the water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The <div class="bookquote">``Portugee''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>was rocking fully a mile away, but when Dan up-ended an
oar he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) left arm three times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty fathom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, stringing a salt clam on to the hook. <div class="bookquote">``Over
with the dough-boys. Bait same's I do, Harve, an' don't snarl your
reel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan's line was out long before Harvey had mastered the mystery of
baiting and heaving out the leads. The dory drifted along easily. It
was not worth while to anchor till they were sure of good ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan shouted, and a shower of spray rattled on Harvey's
shoulders as a big cod flapped and kicked alongside. <div class="bookquote">``Muckle, Harvey,
muckle! Under your hand! Quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Evidently <div class="bookquote">``muckle''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>could not be the dinner-horn, so Harvey passed over
the maul, and Dan scientifically stunned the fish before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) pulled it
inboard, and wrenched out the hook with the short wooden stick he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
called a <div class="bookquote">``gob-stick.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then Harvey felt a tug, and pulled up zealously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, these are strawberries!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Look!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The hook had fouled among a bunch of strawberries, red on one side and
white on the other--perfect reproductions of the land fruit, except
that there were no leaves, and the stem was all pipy and slimy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tech 'em! Slat 'em off. Don't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>The warning came too late. Harvey had picked them from the hook, and
was admiring them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ouch!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) cried, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) fingers throbbed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had grasped
many nettles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naow ye know what strawberry-bottom means. Nothin' `cep' fish should
be teched with the naked fingers, dad says. Slat 'em off ag`in' the
gunnel, an' bait up, Harve. Lookin' won't help any. It's all in the
wages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey smiled at the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) ten and a half dollars a month, and
wondered what his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) mother would say if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) hanging over
the edge of a fishing-dory in mid-ocean. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suffered agonies whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) went out on Saranac Lake; and, by the way, Harvey remembered
distinctly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) used to laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anxieties. Suddenly the line
flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) hand, stinging even through the <div class="bookquote">``flippers,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the
woolen circlets supposed to protect it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s a logy. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) room accordin' to his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) strength,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>cried Dan.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll help ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey snapped, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) hung on to the line. <div class="bookquote">``It's my
first fish. Is--is it a whale?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Halibut, mebbe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan peered down into the water alongside, and
flourished the big <div class="bookquote">``muckle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>ready for all chances. Something white and
oval flickered and fluttered through the green. <div class="bookquote">``I'll lay my wage an'
share he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s over a hundred. Are you so everlastin' anxious to land him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)
alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey's knuckles were raw and bleeding where they had been
banged against the gunwale; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) face was purple-blue between excitement
and exertion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) dripped with sweat, and was half blinded from staring
at the circling sunlit ripples about the swiftly moving line. The boys
were tired long ere the halibut, who took charge of them and the dory
for the next twenty minutes. But the big flat fish was gaffed and
hauled in at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beginner's luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s all of a
hundred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey looked at the huge grey-and-mottled creature with unspeakable
pride. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had seen halibut many times on marble slabs ashore, but it
had never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) to ask how they came inland. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) knew; and
every inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) body ached with fatigue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ef dad was along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, hauling up, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'d read the signs plain's
print. The fish are runnin' smaller an' smaller, an' you've took baout
as logy a halibut's we're apt to find this trip. Yesterday's catch--did
ye notice it?--was all big fish an' no halibut. Dad he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'d read them
signs right off. Dad says everythin' on the Banks is signs, an' can be
read wrong er right. Dad's deeper'n the Whale-hole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) spoke some one fired a pistol on the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, and a
potato-basket was run up in the fore-rigging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I say, naow? That's the call fer the whole crowd. Dad's onter
something, er he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'d never break fishin' this time o' day. Reel up,
Harve, an' we'll pull back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div><p/>They were to windward of the schooner, just ready to flirt the dory
over the still sea, when sounds of woe half a mile off led them to
Penn, who was careering around a fixed point, for all the world like a
gigantic water-bug. The little man backed away and came down again with
enormous energy, but at the end of each manoeuvre his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dory swung round
and snubbed herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) rope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll hey to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>), else he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'ll root an' seed here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. This was a new world, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) could
not lay down the law to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) elders, but had to ask questions humbly.
And the sea was horribly big and unexcited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anchor's fouled. Penn's always losing 'em. Lost two this trip
a`ready,--on sandy bottom, too,--an' dad says next one he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) loses, sure's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a `kelleg'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, who had a vague idea it might be some
kind of marine torture, like keel-hauling in the story-books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Big stone instid of an anchor. You kin see a kelleg ridin' in the bows
fur's you can see a dory, an' all the fleet knows what it means. They'd
guy him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) dreadful. Penn couldn't stand that no more'n a dog with a
dipper to his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) tail. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>)'s so everlastin' sensitive. Hello, Penn! Stuck
again? Don't try any more o' your patents. Come up on her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), and keep
your rodin' straight up an' down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't move,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man panting</b></font>)</div>said the little man, panting. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't move at
all, and indeed I tried everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all this hurrah's-nest for`ard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, pointing to a wild
tangle of spare oars and dory-roding, all matted together by the hand of
inexperience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>said Penn, proudly, <div class="bookquote">``is a Spanish windlass. Mr. Salters
showed me how to make it; but even that doesn't move her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan bent low over the gunwale to hide a smile, twitched once or twice
on the roding, and, behold, the anchor drew at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haul up, Penn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) said, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``er she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) 'll git stuck again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They left him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) regarding the weed-hung flukes of the little anchor with
big, pathetic blue eyes, and thanking them profusely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, say, while I think of it, Harve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, when they were out of
ear-shot, <div class="bookquote">``Penn ain't quite all caulked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) ain't nowise dangerous, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) mind's give out. See?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that so, or is it one of your father's judgments?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey asked, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) bent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) oars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was learning to handle them more easily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dad ain't mistook this time. Penn's a sure`nuff loony. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) ain't

<p/>And yet, half an hour later, as they were dressing-down, the Bank fog
dropped on them, <div class="bookquote">``between fish and fish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bank/Grand Bank</b></font>)</div>as they say. It drove
steadily and in wreaths, curling and smoking along the colourless
water. The men stopped dressing-down without a word. Long Jack and
Uncle Salters slipped the windlass-brakes into their sockets, and began
to heave up the anchor, the windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable
strained on the barrel. Manuel and Tom Platt gave a hand at the last.
The anchor came up with a sob, and the riding-sail bellied as Troop
steadied her (<font color='blue'><b>Bank</b></font>) at the wheel. <div class="bookquote">``Up jib and foresail,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Slip 'em in the smother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long</b></font>)</div>shouted Long Jack, making fast the
jib-sheet, while the others raised the clacking, rattling rings of the
foresail; and the fore-boom creaked as the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>looked up into
the wind and dived off into blank, whirling white.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's wind behind this fog,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troop.

<p/>It was all wonderful beyond words to Harvey; and the most wonderful
part was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) heard no orders except an occasional grunt from Troop,
ending with, <div class="bookquote">``That's good, my son!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Never seen anchor weighed before?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt, to Harvey gaping
at the damp canvas of the foresail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Where are we going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fish and make berth, as you'll find out `fore you've bin a week
aboard. It's all new to you, but we never know what may come to us.
Now, take me--Tom Platt--I'd never ha' thought--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's better than fourteen dollars a month an' a bullet in your belly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troop, from the wheel. <div class="bookquote">``Ease your jumbo a grind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dollars an' cents better,''  (<font color='red'><b>war man</b></font>)</div>returned the man-o'-war's man, doing
something to a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it. ``But we didn't
think o' that when we manned the windlass-brakes on the <div class="bookquote">``Miss Jim
Buck',-LSB-1-RSB- outside Beaufort Harbor, with Fort Macon heavin' hot shot at
our stern, an' a livin' gale atop of all. Where was you then, Disko?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jest here, or hereabouts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>Disko replied, ``earnin' my bread on the
deep waters, and dodgin' Reb privateers. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry I can't accommodate you
with red-hot shot, Tom Platt; but I guess we'll come aout all right on
wind `fore we see Eastern Point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now, varied by
a solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the
fo`c`sle. The rigging dripped clammy drops, and the men lounged along
the lee of the house--all save Uncle Salters, who sat stiffly on the
main-hatch nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) stung hands.


<p/>-LSB-1-RSB- The Gemsbok, U. S. N.?


<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)'d carry stays`l,''  (<font color='red'><b>U. S. N.</b></font>)</div>said Disko, rolling one eye at his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)
brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wouldn't to any sorter profit. What's the sense o' wastin'
canvas?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the farmer-sailor replied.

<p/>The wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in Disko's hands. A few seconds
later a hissing wave-top slashed diagonally across the boat, smote
Uncle Salters between the shoulders, and drenched him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) from head to
foot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) rose sputtering, and went forward, only to catch another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See dad chase him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>), all around the deck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Uncle Salters he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)

Salters had taken refuge by the foremast, but a wave slapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) over
the knees. Disko's face was as blank as the circle of the wheel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>)'d lie easier under stays`l, Salters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) had seen nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Set your old kite, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the victim</b></font>)</div>roared the victim, through a cloud of spray;
<div class="bookquote">``only don't lay it to me if anything happens. Penn, you go below right
off an' git your coffee. You ought to hev more sense than to bum
araound on deck this weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the victim</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now they'll swill coffee an' play checkers till the cows come home,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, as Uncle Salters hustled Penn into the fore-cabin. <div class="bookquote">''`Looks to
me like's if we'd all be doin' so fer a spell. There's nothin' in
creation deader-limpsey-idler'n a Banker when she (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) ain't on fish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad ye spoke, Danny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>cried Long Jack, who had been casting round
in search of amusement. <div class="bookquote">``I'd clean forgot we'd a passenger under that
T-wharf hat. There's no idleness for thim that don't know their ropes.
Pass him (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) along, Tom Platt, an' we'll l'arn him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tain't my trick this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>grinned Dan. <div class="bookquote">``You've got to go it alone.
Dad learned me with a rope's end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div><p/>For an hour Long Jack walked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) prey up and down, teaching, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``things at the sea that ivry man must know, blind, dhrunk, or
asleep.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There is not much gear to a seventy-ton schooner with a
stump-foremast, but Long Jack had a gift of expression. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wished
to draw Harvey's attention to the peak-halyards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dug his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) knuckles
into the back of the boy's neck and kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) at gaze for half a minute.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) emphasised the difference between fore and aft generally by rubbing
Harvey's nose along a few feet of the boom, and the lead of each rope
was fixed in Harvey's mind by the end of the rope itself.

<p/>The lesson would have been easier had the deck been at all free; but
there appeared to be a place on it for everything and anything except a
man. Forward lay the windlass and its tackle, with the chain and hemp
cables, all very unpleasant to trip over; the fo`c`sle stovepipe, and
the gurry-butts by the fo`c`sle-hatch to hold the fish-livers. Aft of
these the fore-boom and booby of the main-hatch took all the space that
was not needed for the pumps and dressing-pens. Then came the nests of
dories lashed to ring-bolts by the quarter-deck; the house, with tubs
and oddments lashed all around it; and, last, the sixty-foot main-boom
in its crutch, splitting things lengthwise, to duck and dodge under
every time.

<p/>Tom Platt, of course, could not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) oar out of the business, but
ranged alongside with enormous and unnecessary descriptions of sails
and spars on the old Ohio.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Niver mind fwhat he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says; attind to me, Innocince. Tom Platt, this
bally-hoo's not the Ohio, an' you're mixing the bhoy bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haul that in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, pointing to leeward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fwhat? The North Atlantuc?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, the boom. Then run that rope you showed me back there--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's no way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>Tom Platt burst in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quiet! He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)'s l'arnin', an' has not the names good yet. Go on, Harve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's the reef-pennant. I'd hook the tackle on to the reef-pennant,
and then let down--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lower the sail, child! Lower!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt, in a professional agony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lower the throat-and peak-halyards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey went on. Those names stuck
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lay your hand on thim,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack.

<p/>Harvey obeyed. <div class="bookquote">``Lower till that rope-loop--on the
after-leach--kris--no, it's cringle--till the cringle was down on the
boom. Then I'd tie her (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) up the way you said, and then I'd hoist up the
peak-and throat-halyards again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You've forgot to pass the tack-earing, but wid time and help ye'll
l'arn. There's good and just reason for ivry rope aboard, or else
`twould be overboard. D'ye follow me? <div class="bookquote">``Tis dollars an' cents I'm
puttin' into your pocket, ye skinny little supercargo, so that fwhin
ye've filled out ye can ship from Boston to Cuba an' tell thim Long
Jack l'arned you. Now I'll chase ye around a piece, callin' the ropes,
an' you'll lay your hand on thim as I call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) began, and Harvey, who was feeling rather tired, walked slowly to
the rope named. A rope's end licked round his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) ribs, and nearly knocked
the breath out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you own a boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt, with severe eyes, <div class="bookquote">``you can walk.
Till then, take all orders at the run. Once more--to make sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey was in a glow with the exercise, and this last cut warmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
thoroughly. Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was a singularly smart boy, the son of a very
clever man and a very sensitive woman, with a fine resolute temper that
systematic spoiling had nearly turned to mulish obstinacy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at
the other men, and saw that even Dan did not smile. It was evidently
all in the day's work, though it hurt abominably; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) swallowed the
hint with a gulp and a gasp and a grin. The same smartness that led him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
to take such advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) mother made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) very sure that no one on
the boat, except, maybe, Penn, would stand the least nonsense. One
learns a great deal from a mere tone. Long Jack called over half a
dozen more ropes, and Harvey danced over the deck like an eel at
ebb-tide, one eye on Tom Platt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ver' good. Ver' good done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>said Manuel. <div class="bookquote">``After supper I show you a
little schooner I make, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ropes. So we shall learn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fust-class fer--a passenger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Dad he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s jest allowed you'll
be wuth your salt maybe `fore you're draownded. Thet's a heap fer dad.
I'll learn you more our next watch together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Taller!''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>grunted Disko, peering through the fog as it smoked over the
bows. There was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging
jib-boom, while alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn, pale
waves whispering and upping one to the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I'll learn you something Long Jack can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>shouted Tom Platt, as
from a locker by the stern he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) produced a battered deep-sea lead
hollowed at one end, smeared the hollow from a saucer full of mutton
tallow, and went forward. <div class="bookquote">``I'll learn you how to fly the Blue Pigeon.
Shooo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko did something to the wheel that checked the schooner's way, while
Manuel, with Harvey to help -LRB-and a proud boy was Harvey-RRB-, let down the
jib in a lump on the boom. The lead sung a deep droning song as Tom
Platt whirled it round and round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go ahead, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``We're not drawin'
twenty-five fut off Fire Island in a fog. There's no trick to ut.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be jealous, Galway.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The released lead plopped into the sea far
ahead as the schooner surged slowly forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Soundin' is a trick, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, <div class="bookquote">``when your dipsey lead's all
the eye you're like to hev for a week. What d'you make it, dad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko's face relaxed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) skill and honour were involved in the march
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) had stolen on the rest of the fleet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) reputation as a
master artist who knew the Banks blindfold. <div class="bookquote">``Sixty, mebbe--ef I'm any
judge,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) replied, with a glance at the tiny compass in the window of
the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sixty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>sung out Tom Platt, hauling in great wet coils.

<p/>The schooner gathered way once more. <div class="bookquote">``Heave!''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, after a
quarter of an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What d'you make it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan whispered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) looked at Harvey proudly.
But Harvey was too proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) own performances to be impressed just
then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father. <div class="bookquote">``I mistrust we're right over the nick o'
Green Bank on old Sixty-Fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>roared Tom Platt. They could scarcely see him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) through the fog.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s bu`st within a yard--like the shells at Fort Macon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bait up, Harve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, diving for a line on the reel.

<p/>The schooner seemed to be straying promiscuously through the smother,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) head-sail banging wildly. The men waited and looked at the boys,
who began fishing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan's lines twitched on the scored and scarred rail. <div class="bookquote">``Now haow
in thunder did dad know? Help us here, Harve. It's a big un.
Poke-hooked, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They hauled together, and landed a goggle-eyed
twenty-pound cod. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) had taken the bait right into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) stomach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s all covered with little crabs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>cried Harvey, turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the great hook-block, they're lousy already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack.
<div class="bookquote">``Disko, ye kape your spare eyes under the keel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>each man</b></font>)</div><p/>Splash went the anchor, and they all heaved over the lines, each man
taking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own place at the bulwarks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they good to eat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey panted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lugged in another
crab-covered cod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure. When they're lousy it's a sign they've all been herdin' together
by the thousand, and when they take the bait that way they're hungry.
Never mind how the bait sets. They'll bite on the bare hook.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, this is great!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey cried, as the fish came in gasping and
splashing--nearly all poke-hooked, as Dan had said. <div class="bookquote">``Why can't we
always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Allus can, till we begin to dress-daown. Efter thet, the heads and
offals `u'd scare the fish to Fundy. Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned
progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows. Guess we'll
run aout aour trawl to-night. Harder on the back, this, than frum the
dory, ain't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was rather back-breaking work, for in a dory the weight of a cod is
water-borne till the last minute, and you are, so to speak, abreast of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>); but the few feet of a schooner's free-board make so much extra
dead-hauling, and stooping over the bulwarks cramps the stomach. But it
was wild and furious sport so long as it lasted; and a big pile lay
aboard when the fish ceased biting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Penn and Uncle Salters?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey asked, slapping the slime off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) oilskins, and reeling up the line in careful imitation of the
others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Git's coffee and see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>Under the yellow glare of the lamp on the pawl-post, the fo`c`sle table
down and opened, utterly unconscious of fish or weather, sat the two
men, a checker-board between them, Uncle Salters snarling at Penn's
every move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter naow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said the former, as Harvey, one hand in the
leather loop at the head of the ladder, hung shouting to the cook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Big fish and lousy-heaps and heaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey replied, quoting Long
Jack. <div class="bookquote">``How's the game?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Penn's jaw dropped. <div class="bookquote">``Tweren't none o' his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>snapped Uncle
Salters. <div class="bookquote">``Penn's deef.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Checkers, weren't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, as Harvey staggered aft with the
steaming coffee in a tin pail. <div class="bookquote">``That lets us out o' cleanin' up
to-night. Dad's a jest man. They'll have to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An' two young fellers I know'll bait up a tub or so o' trawl, while
they're cleanin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, lashing the wheel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) taste.

<p/>``Urn! <div class="bookquote">``Guess I'd ruther clean up, dad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't doubt it. Ye wun't, though. Dress-daown! Dress-daown! Penn'll
pitch while you two bait up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why in thunder didn't them blame boys tell us you'd struck on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said
Uncle Salters, shuffling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) place at the table. <div class="bookquote">``This knife's
gum-blunt, Dan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ef stickin' out cable don't wake ye, guess you'd better hire a boy o'
your own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, muddling about in the dusk over the tubs full of
trawl-line lashed to windward of the house. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Harve, don't ye want
to slip down an' git's bait?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bait ez we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``I mistrust shag-fishin' will pay better,
ez things go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>That meant the boys would bait with selected offal of the cod as the
fish were cleaned--an improvement on paddling barehanded in the little
bait-barrels below. The tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a
big hook each few feet; and the testing and baiting of every single
hook, with the stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear
when shot from the dory, was a scientific business. Dan managed it in
the dark without looking, while Harvey caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) fingers on the barbs
and bewailed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) fate. But the hooks flew through Dan's fingers like
tatting on an old maid's lap. <div class="bookquote">``I helped bait up trawl ashore `fore I
could well walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But it's a putterin' job all the same. Oh,
dad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>This shouted towards the hatch, where Disko and Tom Platt were
salting. <div class="bookquote">``How many skates you reckon we'll need?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Baout three. Hurry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's three hundred fathom to each tub,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan explained; ``more'n
enough to lay out tonight. Ouch! ``Slipped up there, I did.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) stuck

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what this is, if `tisn't regular trawling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw! This is jest one o' dad's blame experiments. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) don't trawl

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn Salters</b></font>)</div><p/>Penn and Uncle Salters cleaned up as Disko had ordained, but the boys
profited little. No sooner were the tubs furnished than Tom Platt and
Long Jack, who had been exploring the inside of a dory with a lantern,
snatched them away, loaded up the tubs and some small, painted
trawl-buoys, and hove the boat overboard into what Harvey regarded as
an exceedingly rough sea. <div class="bookquote">``They'll be drowned. Why, the dory's loaded
like a freight-car,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll be back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, <div class="bookquote">``an' in case you'll not be lookin' for
us, we'll lay into you both if the trawl's snarled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div><p/>The dory surged up on the crest of a wave, and just when it seemed
impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Disko</b></font>) could avoid smashing against the schooner's side,
slid over the ridge, and was swallowed up in the damp dusk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a-hold here, an' keep ringin' steady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, passing Harvey
the lanyard of a bell that hung just behind the windlass.

<p/>Harvey rang lustily, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) felt two lives depended on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>). But Disko
in the cabin, scrawling in the log-book, did not look like a murderer,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) went to supper he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) even smiled drily at the anxious Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This ain't no weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you an' me could set thet
trawl! They've only gone out jest far `nough so's not to foul our

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clang! cling! clang!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey kept it up, varied with occasional
rub-a-dubs, for another half-hour. There was a bellow and a bump
alongside. Manuel and Dan raced to the hooks of the dory-tackle; Long
Jack and Tom Platt arrived on deck together, it seemed, one half the
North Atlantic at their backs, and the dory followed them in the air,
landing with a clatter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nary snarl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) dripped. <div class="bookquote">``Danny, you'll do yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The pleasure av your comp`ny to the banquit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack,
squelching the water from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) boots as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) capered like an elephant and
stuck an oilskinned arm into Harvey's face. <div class="bookquote">``We do be condescending to
honour the second half wid our presence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>And off they all four rolled
to supper, where Harvey stuffed himself to the brim on fish-chowder and
fried pies, and fell fast asleep just as Manuel produced from a locker
a lovely two-foot model of the Lucy Holmes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) first boat, and was
going to show Harvey the ropes. Harvey never even twiddled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) fingers
as Penn pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) bunk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be a sad thing--a very sad thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>said Penn, watching the
boy's face, <div class="bookquote">``for his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) father, who think he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) is dead. To

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Git out o' this, Penn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Go aft and finish your game with

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ver' good boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>said Manuel, slipping out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) boots and
disappearing into the black shadows of the lower bunk. <div class="bookquote">``Expec' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) make
good man, Danny. I no see he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) is any so mad as your parpa he (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) says. Eh,
wha-at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan chuckled, but the chuckle ended in a snore.

<p/>It was thick weather outside, with a rising wind, and the elder men
stretched their watches. The hours struck clear in the cabin; the
nosing bows slapped and scuffled with the seas; the fo`c`sle stovepipe
hissed and sputtered as the spray caught it; and the boys slept on,
while Disko, Long Jack, Tom Plait, and Uncle Salters, each in turn,
stumped aft to look at the wheel, forward to see that the anchor held,
or to veer out a little more cable against chafing, with a glance at
the dim anchor-light between each round.



<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>Harvey waked to find the <div class="bookquote">``first half''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>at `breakfast, the fo`c`sle door
drawn to a crack, and every square inch of the schooner singing its own
tune. The black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over
the glare of the stove, and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden
board before it jarred and racketed to each plunge. Up and up the
fo`c`sle climbed, yearning and surging and quivering, and then, with a
clear, sickle-like swoop, came down into the seas. He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) could hear the
flaring bows cut and squelch, and there was a pause ere the divided
waters came down on the deck above, like a volley of buck-shot.
Followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawse-hole; a grunt and
squeal of the windlass; a yaw, a punt, and a kick, and the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>gathered herself together to repeat the motions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, ashore,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) heard Long Jack saying, <div class="bookquote">``ye've chores, an' ye must do
thim in any weather. Here we're well clear of the fleet, an' we've no
chores--an' that's a blessin'. Good night, all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) passed like a big
snake from the table to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bunk, and began to smoke. Tom Platt
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) example; Uncle Salters, with Penn, fought his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) way up the
ladder to stand his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) watch, and the cook set for the <div class="bookquote">``second half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div><p/>It came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs, with a shake
and a yawn. It ate till it could eat no more; and then Manuel filled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) pipe with some terrible tobacco, crotched himself between the
pawl-post and a forward bunk, cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) feet up on the table, and
smiled tender and indolent smiles at the smoke. Dan lay at length in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) bunk, wrestling with a gaudy, gilt-stopped accordion, whose tunes
went up and down with the pitching of the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'' (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>. The cook, his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
shoulders against the locker where he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) kept the fried pies -LRB-Dan was fond
of fried pies-RRB-, peeled potatoes, with one eye on the stove in event of
too much water finding its way down the pipe; and the general smell and
smother were past all description.

<p/>Harvey considered affairs, wondered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was not deathly sick, and
crawled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) bunk again, as the softest and safest place, while Dan
struck up, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to play in your yard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>as accurately as the
wild jerks allowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long is this for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey asked of Manuel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Till she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) get a little quiet, and we can row to trawl. Perhaps
to-night. Perhaps two days more. You do not like? Eh, wha-at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been crazy sick a week ago, but it doesn't seem to upset
me now--much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is because we make you fisherman, these days. If I was you, when
I come to Gloucester I would give two, three big candles for my good
luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure--the Virgin of our Church on the Hill. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is very good to
fishermen all the time. That is why so few of us Portugee men ever are
drowned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a Roman Catholic, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a Madeira man. I am not a Porto Pico boy. Shall I be Baptist,
then? Eh, wha-at? I always give candles--two, three more when I come to
Gloucester. The good Virgin she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) never forgets me, Manuel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't sense it that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>Tom Platt put in from his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) bunk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)
scarred face lit up by the glare of a match as he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) sucked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) pipe.
<div class="bookquote">``It stands to reason the sea's the sea; and you'll git jest about
what's goin', candles or kerosene, fer that matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tis a mighty good thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, ``to have a fri`nd at coort,
though. I'm o' Manuel's way o' thinkin'. About tin years back I was
crew to a Sou' Boston market-boat. We was off Minot's Ledge wid a
northeaster, butt first, atop of us, thicker'n burgoo. The ould man was
dhrunk, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin waggin' on the tiller, an' I sez to myself, ``If iver I
stick my boat-huk into T-wharf again, I'll show the saints fwhat manner
o' craft they saved me out av.<div class="bookquote">'' Now, I'm here, as ye can well see, an'
the model of the dhirty ould Kathleen, that took me a month to make, I
gave ut to the priest, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) hung Ut up forninst the altar. There's
more sense in givin' a model that's by way o' bein' a work av art than
any candle. Ye can buy candles at store, but a model shows the good
saints ye've tuk trouble an' are grateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``D'you believe that, Irish?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) elbow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would I do Ut if I did not, Ohio?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wa-al, Enoch Fuller he (<font color='blue'><b>Fuller</b></font>) made a model o' the old Ohio, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Irish</b></font>)'s to
Salem museum now. Mighty pretty model, too, but I guess Enoch he (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) never
done it fer no sacrifice; an' the way I take it is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>fishermen</b></font>)</div><p/>There were the makings of an hour-long discussion of the kind that
fishermen love, where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one
proves anything at the end, had not Dan struck up this cheerful rhyme:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Up jumped the mackerel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) striped back.
Reef in the mainsail, and haul on the tack;
For it's windy weather--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Long Jack joined in:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it's blowy weather;
When the winds begin to blow, pipe all hands together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan went on, with a cautious look at Tom Plait, holding the accordion
low in the bunk:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Up jumped the cod with his (<font color='blue'><b>Enoch</b></font>) chuckle-head,
Went to the main-chains to heave at the lead;
For it's windy weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Plait</b></font>)</div>etc..

<p/>Tom Platt seemed to be hunting for something. Dan crouched lower, but
sang louder:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Up jumped the flounder that swims to the ground.
Chuckle-head! Chuckle-head!
Mind where ye sound!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom Platt's huge rubber boot whirled across the fo`c`sle and caught
Dan's uplifted arm. There was war between the man and the boy ever
since Dan had discovered that the mere whistling of that tune would
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) angry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) heaved the lead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thought I'd fetch yer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, returning the gift with precision.
<div class="bookquote">``Ef you don't like my music, git out your fiddle. I ain't goin' to lie
here all day an' listen to you an' Long Jack arguin' `baout candles.
Fiddle, Tom Platt; or I'll learn Harve here the tune!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom Platt leaned down to a locker and brought up an old white fiddle.
Manuel's eye glistened, and from somewhere behind the pawl-post he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) drew
out a tiny, guitar-like thing with wire strings, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) called a
_machette_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a concert,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, beaming through the smoke. <div class="bookquote">``A reg`lar
Boston concert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a burst of spray as the hatch opened, and Disko, in yellow
oilskins, descended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye're just in time, Disko. Fwhat's she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doin' outside?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jest this!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dropped on to the lockers with the push and heave of
the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're singin' to kape our breakfasts down. Ye'll lead, av course,
Disko,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess there ain't more'n `baout two old songs I know, an' ye've heerd
them both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) excuses were cut short by Tom Platt launching into a most dolorous
tune, like unto the moaning of winds and the creaking of masts. With
his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) eyes fixed on the beams above, Disko began this ancient, ancient
ditty, Tom Platt flourishing all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) to make the tune and words
fit a little:

<p/>``There is a crack packet--crack packet o' fame,
She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hails from Noo York, an' the Dreadnought's her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) name.
You may talk o' your fliers--Swallow-tail and Black Ball--
But the Dreadnought's the packet that can beat them all.

<p/>``Now the Dreadnought she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lies in the River Mersey,
Because of the tugboat to take her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to sea;
But when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s off soundings you shortly will know
-LRB-Chorus.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s the Liverpool packet--O Lord, let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) go!

<p/>``Now the Dreadnought she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s howlin' `crost the Banks o' Newfoundland,
Where the water's all shallow and the bottom's all sand.
Sez all the little fishes that swim to an' fro:
-LRB-Chorus.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s the Liverpool packet--O Lord, let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) go!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There were scores of verses, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) worked the Dreadnought every mile
of the way between Liverpool and New York as conscientiously as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) were on her (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) deck, and the accordion pumped and the fiddle squeaked
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>). Tom Platt followed with something about <div class="bookquote">``the rough and
tough McGinn, who would pilot the vessel in.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>Then they called on
Harvey, who felt very flattered, to contribute to the entertainment;
but all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) could remember were some pieces of <div class="bookquote">``Skipper Ireson's
Ride''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had been taught at the camp-school in the Adirondacks. It
seemed that they might be appropriate to the time and place, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had
no more than mentioned the title when Disko brought down one foot with
a bang, and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Don't go on, young feller. That's a mistaken
jedgment--one o' the worst kind, too, becaze it's catchin' to the ear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I orter ha' warned you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Thet allus fetches dad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, surprised and a little angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All you're goin' to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``All dead wrong from start to
finish, an' Whittier he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s to blame. I have no special call to right any
Marblehead man, but `tweren't no fault o' Ireson's. My father he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told
me the tale time an' again, an' this is the way `twuz.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the wan hundreth time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>put in Long Jack, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) breath.

<p/>``Ben Ireson he (<font color='blue'><b>Ireson</b></font>) was skipper o' the Betty, young feller, comin' home frum
the Banks--that was before the war of 1812, but jestice is jestice at
all times. They f`und the Active o' Portland, an' Gibbons o' that town
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibbons</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) skipper; they f`und her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) leakin' off Cape Cod Light. There
was a terr`ble gale on, an' they was gettin' the Betty home's fast as
they could craowd her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>). Well, Ireson he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibbons</b></font>) said there warn't any sense to
reskin' a boat in that sea; the men they wouldn't hev it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gibbons</b></font>) laid
it before them to stay by the Active till the sea run daown a piece.
They wouldn't hev that either, hangin' araound the Cape in any sech
weather, leak or no leak. They jest up stays'l an' quit, nat`rally
takin' Ireson with 'em. Folks to Marblehead was mad at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gibbons</b></font>) not runnin'
the risk, and becaze nex' day, when the sea was ca'am -LRB-they never
stopped to think o' that-RRB-, some of the Active's folk was took off by a
Truro man. They come into Marblehead with their own tale to tell,
sayin' how Ireson had shamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ireson</b></font>) town, an' so forth an' so on; an'
Ireson's men they was scared, seem' public feelin' ag`in' 'em, an' they
went back on Ireson, an' swore he (<font color='blue'><b>Ireson</b></font>) was respons`ble for the hull act.
``Tweren't the women neither that tarred and feathered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ireson</b></font>)--Marblehead
women don't act that way--'twas a passel o' men an' boys, an' they
carted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ireson</b></font>) araound town in an old dory till the bottom fell aout, an'
Ireson he (<font color='blue'><b>Ireson</b></font>) told 'em they'd be sorry for it some day. Well, the facts
came aout later, same's they usually do, too late to be any ways useful
to an honest man; an' Whittier he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come along an' picked up the slack
eend of a lyin' tale, an' tarred and feathered Ben Ireson all over onct
more after he (<font color='blue'><b>Ireson</b></font>) was dead. <div class="bookquote">``Twas the only time Whittier ever slipped up,
an' `tweren't fair. I whaled Dan good when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) brought that piece back
from school. You don't know no better, o' course; but I've give you
the facts, hereafter an' evermore to be remembered. Ben Ireson weren't
no sech kind o' man as Whittier makes aout; my father he (<font color='blue'><b>Ireson</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Ireson</b></font>) well,
before an' after that business, an' you beware o' hasty jedgments,
young feller. Next!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey had never heard Disko talk so long, and collapsed with burning
cheeks; but, as Dan said promptly, a boy could only learn what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
taught at school, and life was too short to keep track of every lie
along the coast.

<p/>Then Manuel touched the jangling, jarring little _machette_ to a queer
tune, and sang something in Portuguese about <div class="bookquote">``Nina, innocente!''  (<font color='red'><b>Portuguese</b></font>)</div>ending
with a full-handed sweep that brought the song up with a jerk. Then
Disko obliged with his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) second song, to an old-fashioned creaky tune,
and all joined in the chorus. This is one stanza:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now Aprile is over and melted the snow,
And outer Noo Bedford we shortly must tow;
Yes, out o' Noo Bedford we shortly must clear,
We're the whalers that never see wheat in the ear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the fiddle went very softly for a while by itself, and then:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wheat-in-the-ear, my true-love's posy blowin';
Wheat-in-the-ear, we're goin' off to sea;
Wheat-in-the-ear, I left you fit for sowin';
When I come back a loaf o' bread you'll be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>That made Harvey almost weep, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) could not tell why. But it was
much worse when the cook dropped the potatoes and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) hands
for the fiddle. Still leaning against the locker door, he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) struck into a
tune that was like something very bad but sure to happen whatever you
did. After a little he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) sang in an unknown tongue, his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) big chin down on
the fiddle-tail, his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) white eyeballs glaring in the lamplight. Harvey
swung out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) bunk to hear better; and amid the straining of the
timbers and the wash of the waters the tune crooned and moaned on, like
lee surf in a blind fog, till it ended with a wail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jimmy Christmas! Thet gives me the blue creevles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncle Salters has catched his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) father departed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's blown clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>Disko cried, and all the fo`c`sle tumbled up for a
bit of fresh air. The fog had gone, but a sullen sea ran in great
rollers behind it. The <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>slid, as it were, into long, sunk
avenues and ditches which felt quite sheltered and homelike if they
would only stay still; but they changed without rest or mercy, and
flung up the schooner to crown one peak of a thousand grey hills, while
the wind hooted through her (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) rigging as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) zigzagged down the slopes.
Far away a sea would burst in a sheet of foam, and the others would
follow suit as at a signal, till Harvey's eyes swam with the vision of
interlacing whites and greys. Four or five Mother Carey's chickens
stormed round in circles, shrieking as they swept past the bows. A
rain-squall or two strayed aimlessly over the hopeless waste, ran down
wind and back again, and melted away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Seems to me I saw somethin' flicker jest naow over yonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said
Uncle Salters, pointing to the northeast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't be any of the fleet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, peering under his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) eyebrows, a
hand on the fo`c`sle gangway as the solid bows hatcheted into the
troughs. <div class="bookquote">``Sea's oilin' over dretful fast. Danny, don't you want to skip
up a piece an' see how aour trawl-buoy lays?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Danny</b></font>)</div><p/>Danny, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Danny</b></font>) big boots, trotted rather than climbed up the main
rigging -LRB-this consumed Harvey with envy-RRB-, hitched himself around the
reeling crosstrees, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) eye rove till it caught the tiny black
buoy-flag on the shoulder of a mile-away swell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>)'s all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) hailed. <div class="bookquote">``Sail O! Dead to the no`th`ard, comin'
down like smoke! Schooner she (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) be, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They waited yet another half-hour, the sky clearing in patches, with a
flicker of sickly sun from time to time that made patches of
olive-green water. Then a stump-foremast lifted, ducked, and
disappeared, to be followed on the next wave by a high stern with
old-fashioned wooden snail's-horn davits. The sails were red-tanned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Frenchmen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>shouted Dan. <div class="bookquote">``No, `tain't, neither. Da-ad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's no French,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``Salters, your blame luck holds
tighter'n a screw in a keg-head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've eyes. It's Uncle Abishai.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't nowise tell fer sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The head-king of all Jonahs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>groaned Tom Platt. ``Oh, Salters,
Salters, why wasn't you abed an' asleep?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I tell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said poor Salters, as the schooner swung up.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) might have been the very Flying Dutchman, so foul, draggled, and
unkempt was every rope and stick aboard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) old-style quarter-deck was
some four or five feet high, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) rigging flew knotted and tangled
like weed at a wharf-end. She (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) was running before the wind--yawing
frightfully--her (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) staysail let down to act as a sort of extra
foresail,--<div class="bookquote">``scandalised,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>they call it,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) fore-boom guyed out
over the side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) bowsprit cocked up like an old-fashioned frigate's;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) jib-boom had been fished and spliced and nailed and clamped beyond
further repair; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) hove herself forward, and sat down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)
broad tail, she (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) looked for all the world like a blowzy, frousy, bad old
woman sneering at a decent girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Abishai,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Salters. <div class="bookquote">``Full o' gin an' Judique men, an' the
judgments o' Providence layin' fer him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) an' never takin' good holt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)'s

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)'ll run her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) under,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack. <div class="bookquote">``That's no rig fer this weather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>), 'r he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)'d `a' done it long ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>Disko replied. <div class="bookquote">``Looks's if he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)
cal`lated to run us under. Ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) daown by the head more'n natural,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ef it's his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) style o' loadin' her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) ain't safe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div>said the sailor,
slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Ef she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'s spewed her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) oakum he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)'d better git to his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) pumps mighty
quick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The creature</b></font>)</div><p/>The creature thrashed up, wore round with a clatter and rattle, and lay
head to wind within ear-shot.

<p/>A greybeard wagged over the bulwark, and a thick voice yelled something
Harvey could not understand. But Disko's face darkened. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)'d resk
every stick he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) hez to carry bad news. Says we're in fer a shift o'
wind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)'s in fer worse. Abishai! Abishai!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) arm up and
down with the gesture of a man at the pumps, and pointed forward. The
crew mocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jounce ye, an' strip ye, an' trip ye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>yelled Uncle Abishai. <div class="bookquote">``A livin'
gale--a livin' gale. Yah! Cast up fer your last trip, all you
Gloucester haddocks. You won't see Gloucester no more, no more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Crazy full--as usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt. <div class="bookquote">``Wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) hadn't spied us,
though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drifted out of hearing while the greyhead yelled something about a
dance at the Bay of Bulls and a dead man in the fo`c`sle. Harvey
shuddered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had seen the sloven tilled decks and the savage-eyed crew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' that's a fine little floatin' hell fer her (<font color='blue'><b>Yah</b></font>) draught,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long
Jack. <div class="bookquote">``I wondher what mischief he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)'s been at ashore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)'s a trawler,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan explained to Harvey, <div class="bookquote">``an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) runs in fer bait all
along the coast. Oh, no, not home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) don't go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) deals along the
south an' east shore up yonder.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) nodded in the direction of the
pitiless Newfoundland beaches. ``Dad won't never take me ashore there.
They're a mighty tough crowd--an' Abishai's the toughest. You saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)
boat? Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yah</b></font>)'s nigh seventy year old, they say; the last o' the old
Marblehead heel-tappers. They don't make them quarter-decks any more.
Abishai don't use Marblehead, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) ain't wanted there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) jes'
drif's araound, in debt, trawlin' an' cussin' like you've heard. Bin a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twon't be any use underrunnin' the trawl to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt,
with quiet despair. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) come alongside special to cuss us. I'd give my
wage an' share to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) at the gangway o' the old Ohio `fore we quit

crisscross!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The dishevelled <div class="bookquote">``heel-tapper''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>danced drunkenly down wind, and all eyes
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Suddenly the cook cried in his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) phonograph voice: <div class="bookquote">``It wass
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own death made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) speak so! He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) iss fey--fey, I tell you! Look!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sailed into a patch of watery sunshine three or four miles distant.
The patch dulled and faded out, and even as the light passed so did the
schooner. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dropped into a hollow and--was not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run under, by the great hook-block!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted Disko, jumping aft.
<div class="bookquote">``Drunk or sober, we've got to help 'em. Heave short and break her (<font color='blue'><b>fey</b></font>) out!
Smart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey was thrown on the deck by the shock that followed the setting of
the jib and foresail, for they hove short on the cable, and to save
time, jerked the anchor bodily from the bottom, heaving in as they
moved away. This is a bit of brute force seldom resorted to except in
matters of life and death, and the little <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>complained like
a human. They ran down to where Abishai's craft had vanished; found two
or three trawl-tubs, a gin-bottle, and a stove-in dory, but nothing
more. <div class="bookquote">``Let 'em go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, though no one had hinted at picking
them up. ``I wouldn't hev a match that belonged to Abishai aboard.
``Guess she (<font color='blue'><b>fey</b></font>) run clear under. <div class="bookquote">``Must ha' been spewin' her (<font color='blue'><b>fey</b></font>) oakum fer a

along o' leavin' port all hands drunk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glory be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack. <div class="bookquote">``We'd ha' been obliged to help 'em if they
was top o' water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Thinkin' o' that myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fey! Fey!''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>said the cook, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hass taken his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own
luck with him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ver' good thing, I think, to tell the fleet when we see. Eh, wha-at'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>said Manuel. <div class="bookquote">``If you runna that way before the wind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fey</b></font>) work open
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fey</b></font>) seams--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) threw out his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) hands with an indescribable gesture,
while Penn sat down on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and
pity of it all. Harvey could not realise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had seen death on the
open waters, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) felt very sick.

<p/>Then Dan went up the crosstrees, and Disko steered them back to within
sight of their own trawl-buoys just before the fog blanketed the sea
once again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We go mighty quick hereabouts when we do go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) said to
Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``You think on that for a spell, young feller. That was liquor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>After dinner it was calm enough to fish from the decks,--Penn and Uncle
Salters were very zealous this time,--and the catch was large and large
fish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Abishai has shorely took his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) luck with him (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Salters. <div class="bookquote">``The wind
hain't backed ner riz ner nothin'. How abaout the trawl? I despise
superstition, anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom Platt insisted that they had much better haul the thing and make a
new berth. But the cook said: <div class="bookquote">``The luck iss in two pieces. You will
find it so when you look. I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>This so tickled Long Jack that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
overbore Tom Platt, and the two went out together.

<p/>Underrunning a trawl means pulling it in on one side of the dory,
picking off the fish, rebaiting the hooks, and passing them back to the
sea again something like pinning and unpinning linen on a wash-line. It
is a lengthy business and rather dangerous, for the long, sagging line
may twitch a boat under in a flash. But when they heard, <div class="bookquote">``And naow to
thee, O Capting,''  (<font color='red'><b>the crew</b></font>)</div>booming out of the fog, the crew of the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''
 (<font color='red'><b>the crew</b></font>)</div>took heart. The dory swirled alongside well loaded, Tom Platt yelling
for Manuel to act as relief-boat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The luck's cut square in two pieces,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, forking in the
fish, while Harvey stood open-mouthed at the skill with which the
plunging dory was saved from destruction. ``One half was jest punkins.
Tom Platt wanted to haul her (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) an' ha' done wid ut; but I said, ``I'll
back the doctor that has the second sight,<div class="bookquote">'' an' the other half come up
sagging full o' big uns. Hurry, Man`nle, an' bring's a tub o' bait.
There's luck afloat tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had
just been taken, and Tom Platt and Long Jack moved methodically up and
down the length of the trawl, the boat's nose surging under the wet
line of hooks, stripping the sea-cucumbers that they called pumpkins,
slatting off the fresh-caught cod against the gunwale, rebaiting, and
loading Manuel's dory till dusk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take no risks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, then--<div class="bookquote">``not with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) floatin' around
so near. Abishai won't sink fer a week. Heave in the dories, an' we'll
dressdaown after supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>That was a mighty dressing-down, attended by three or four blowing
grampuses. It lasted till nine o'clock, and Disko was thrice heard to
chuckle as Harvey pitched the split fish into the hold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, you're haulin' ahead dretful fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, when they ground
the knives after the men had turned in. <div class="bookquote">``There's somethin' of a sea
tonight, an' I hain't heard you make no remarks on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too busy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey replied, testing a blade's edge. <div class="bookquote">``Come to think of
it, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is a high-kicker.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The little schooner was gambolling all around her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) anchor among the
silver-tipped waves. Backing with a start of affected surprise at the
sight of the strained cable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) pounced on it like a kitten, while the
spray of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) descent burst through the hawse-holes with the report of a
gun. Shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) would say: <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm sorry I can't stay any
longer with you. I'm going North,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and would sidle off, halting
suddenly with a dramatic rattle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) rigging. <div class="bookquote">``As I was just going to
observe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) would begin, as gravely as a drunken man addressing a
lamp-post. The rest of the sentence -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) acted her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) words in dumb-show,
of course-RRB- was lost in a fit of the fidgets, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) behaved like a
puppy chewing a string, a clumsy woman in a side-saddle, a hen with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
head cut off, or a cow stung by a hornet, exactly as the whims of the
sea took her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sayin' her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) piece. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s Patrick Henry naow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) swung sideways on a roller, and gesticulated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) jib-boom from
port to starboard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But-ez--fer-me, give me liberty--er give me-death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Wop! She (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) sat down in the moon-path on the water, courtesying with a
flourish of pride impressive enough had not the wheel-gear sniggered
mockingly in its box.

<p/>Harvey laughed aloud. <div class="bookquote">``Why, it's just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s as stiddy as a haouse an' as dry as a herrin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan,
enthusiastically, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was stung across the deck in a batter of spray.

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>That was the first of many talks with Dan, who told Harvey why he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) would
transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) dory's name to the imaginary Burgess-modelled haddocker.
Harvey heard a good deal about the real Hattie at Gloucester; saw a
lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hattie</b></font>) hair--which Dan, finding fair words of no avail, had
<div class="bookquote">``hooked''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hattie</b></font>) sat in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) at school that winter--and a
photograph. Hattie was about fourteen years old, with an awful contempt
for boys, and had been trampling on Dan's heart through the winter. All
this was revealed under oath of solemn secrecy on moonlit decks, in the
dead dark, or in choking fog; the whining wheel behind them, the
climbing deck before, and without, the unresting, clamorous sea. Once,
of course, as the boys came to know each other, there was a fight,
which raged from bow to stern till Penn came up and separated them, but
promised not to tell Disko, who thought fighting on watch rather worse
than sleeping. Harvey was no match for Dan physically, but it says a
great deal for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) new training that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) defeat and did not try
to get even with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) conqueror by underhand methods.

<p/>That was after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) had been cured of a string of boils between his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
elbows and wrists, where the wet jersey and oilskins cut into the
flesh. The salt water stung them unpleasantly, but when they were ripe
Dan treated them with Disko's razor, and assured Harvey that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was
a <div class="bookquote">``blooded Banker'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; the affliction of gurry-sores being the mark of the
caste that claimed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>).

<p/>Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was a boy and very busy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) did not bother his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) head with too
much thinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was exceedingly sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) mother, and often
longed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and above all to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) wonderful new life,
and how brilliantly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was acquitting himself in it. Otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
preferred not to wonder too much how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was bearing the shock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
supposed death. But one day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) stood on the fo`c`sle ladder, guying
the cook, who had accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) and Dan of hooking fried pies, it
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) that this was a vast improvement on being snubbed by
strangers in the smoking-room of a hired liner.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was a recognised part of the scheme of things on the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>;
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) place at the table and among the bunks; and could hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) own
in the long talks on stormy days, when the others were always ready to
listen to what they called his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``fairy-tales''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) life ashore. It did
not take him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) more than two days and a quarter to feel that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) spoke
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) own life--it seemed very far away--no one except Dan -LRB-and even
Dan's belief was sorely tried-RRB- credited him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) invented a friend, a
boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) had heard of, who drove a miniature four-pony drag in Toledo,
Ohio, and ordered five suits of clothes at a time, and led things
called <div class="bookquote">``germans''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at parties where the oldest girl was not quite
fifteen, but all the presents were solid silver. Salters protested that
this kind of yarn was desperately wicked, if not indeed positively
blasphemous, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) listened as greedily as the others; and their
criticisms at the end gave Harvey entirely new notions on <div class="bookquote">``germans,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>clothes, cigarettes with gold-leaf tips, rings, watches, scent, small
dinner-parties, champagne, card-playing, and hotel accommodation.
Little by little he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) tone when speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``friend,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whom Long Jack had christened <div class="bookquote">``the Crazy Kid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``the Gilt-edged Baby,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``the Suckin' Vanderpoop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>and other pet names; and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sea-booted
feet cocked up on the table would even invent histories about silk
pajamas and specially imported neckwear, to the <div class="bookquote">``friend's''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>discredit.
Harvey was a very adaptable person, with a keen eye and ear for every
face and tone about him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>).

<p/>Before long he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) knew where Disko kept the old green-crusted quadrant
that they called the <div class="bookquote">``hog-yoke'' (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>--under the bed-bag in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) bunk. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
`took the sun, and with the help of <div class="bookquote">``The Old Farmer's''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>almanac found
the latitude, Harvey would jump down into the cabin and scratch the
reckoning and date with a nail on the rust of the stove-pipe. Now, the
chief engineer of the liner could have done no more, and no engineer of
thirty years' service could have assumed one half of the
ancient-mariner air with which Harvey, first careful to spit over the
side, made public the schooner's position for that day, and then and
not till then relieved Disko of the quadrant. There is an etiquette in
all these things.

<p/>The said <div class="bookquote">``hog-yoke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eldridge</b></font>)</div>an Eldridge chart, the farming almanac, Blunt's
<div class="bookquote">``Coast Pilot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Blunt</b></font>)</div>and Bowditch's <div class="bookquote">``Navigator''  (<font color='red'><b>Blunt</b></font>)</div>were all the weapons Disko
needed to guide him (<font color='blue'><b>Blunt</b></font>), except the deep-sea lead that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Blunt</b></font>) spare eye.
Harvey nearly slew Penn with it when Tom Platt taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) first how to
<div class="bookquote">``fly the blue pigeon'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>; and, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) strength was not equal to
continuous sounding in any sort of a sea, for calm weather with a
seven-pound lead on shoal water Disko used him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) freely. As Dan said:
<div class="bookquote">''`Tain't soundin's dad wants. It's samples. Grease her (<font color='blue'><b>Tai</b></font>) up good, Harve.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Harvey would tallow the cup at the end, and carefully bring the sand,
shell, sludge, or whatever it might be, to Disko, who fingered and
smelt it and gave judgment. As has been said, when Disko thought of cod
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) thought as a cod; and by some long-tested mixture of instinct and
experience, moved the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from berth to berth, always with the
fish, as a blindfolded chess-player moves on the unseen board.

<p/>But Disko's board was the Grand Bank--a triangle two hundred and fifty
miles on each side a waste of wallowing sea, cloaked with dank fog,
vexed with gales, harried with drifting ice, scored by the tracks of
the reckless liners, and dotted with the sails of the fishing-fleet.

<p/>For days they worked in fog--Harvey at the bell--till, grown familiar
with the thick airs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) went out with Tom Platt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) heart rather in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) mouth. But the fog would not lift, and the fish were biting, and no
one can stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time. Harvey devoted
himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lines and the gaff or gob-stick as Tom Platt called for
them; and they rowed back to the schooner guided by the bell and Tom's
instinct; Manuel's conch sounding thin and faint beside them. But it
was an unearthly experience, and, for the first time in a month, Harvey
dreamed of the shifting, smoking floors of water round the dory, the
lines that strayed away into nothing, and the air above that melted on
the sea below ten feet from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) straining eyes. A few days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was
out with Manuel on what should have been forty-fathom bottom, but the
whole length of the roding ran out, and still the anchor found nothing,
and Harvey grew mortally afraid, for that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) last touch with earth was
lost. <div class="bookquote">``Whale-hole,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>said Manuel, hauling in. <div class="bookquote">``That is good joke on
Disko. Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) rowed to the schooner to find Tom Platt and the
others jeering at the skipper because, for once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) had led them to the
edge of the barren Whale-deep, the blank hole of the Grand Bank. They
made another berth through the fog, and that time the hair of Harvey's
head stood up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) went out in Manuel's dory. A whiteness moved in
the whiteness of the fog with a breath like the breath of the grave,
and there was a roaring, a plunging, and spouting. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) first
introduction to the dread summer berg of the Banks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) cowered in
the bottom of the boat while Manuel laughed. There were days, though,
clear and soft and warm, when it seemed a sin to do anything but loaf
over the hand-lines and spank the drifting <div class="bookquote">``sun-scalds''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>with an oar;
and there were days of light airs, when Harvey was taught how to steer
the schooner from one berth to another.

<p/>It thrilled through him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) first felt the keel answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) hand
on the spokes and slide over the long hollows as the foresail scythed
back and forth against the blue sky. That was magnificent, in spite of
Disko saying that it would break a snake's back to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) wake.
But, as usual, pride ran before a fall. They were sailing on the wind
with the staysail--an old one, luckily--set, and Harvey jammed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
right into it to show Dan how completely he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had mastered the art. The
foresail went over with a bang, and the foregaff stabbed and ripped
through the stay-sail, which, was of course, prevented from going over
by the mainstay. They lowered the wreck in awful silence, and Harvey
spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) leisure hours for the next few days under Tom Platt's lee,
learning to use a needle and palm. Dan hooted with joy, for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) had made the very same blunder himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) early days.

<p/>Boylike, Harvey imitated all the men by turns, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had combined
Disko's peculiar stoop at the wheel, Long Jack's swinging overhand when
the lines were hauled, Manuel's round-shouldered but effective stroke
in a dory, and Tom Platt's generous Ohio stride along the deck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis beautiful to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) takes to ut,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, when Harvey
was looking out by the windlass one thick noon. ``I'll lay my wage an'
share `tis more'n half play-actin' to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>), an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) consates himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>)'s

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the way we all begin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt. <div class="bookquote">``The boys they make

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) spoke down the cabin stairs. <div class="bookquote">''`Guess you're mistook in your

dripping peaceably under the lee of the starboard dory-nest.

<p/>Tom Platt puffed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) pipe in scornful silence: he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) was a Cape Cod
man, and had not known that tale more than twenty years. Uncle Salters
went on with a rasping chuckle:

<p/>``Sim`on Peter Ca`houn he (<font color='blue'><b>Sim</b></font>) said, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sim</b></font>) was jest right, abaout Lorin',
``Ha'af on the taown,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) said, `an' t`other ha'af blame fool; an' they

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sim</b></font>) didn't talk any Pennsylvania Dutch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>Tom Platt replied. <div class="bookquote">``You'd

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wal, I don't profess to be any elocutionist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>Salters said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm

 (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div><p/>A little laugh went round at Salters's expense.

<p/>Disko held his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) tongue, and wrought over the log-book that he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) kept in a
hatchet-faced, square hand; this was the kind of thing that ran on,
page after soiled page:

<p/>``July 17. This day thick fog and few fish. Made berth to northward. So
ends this day.

<p/>``July 18. This day comes in with thick fog. Caught a few fish.

<p/>``July 19. This day comes in with light breeze from N. E. and fine
weather. Made a berth to eastward. Caught plenty fish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``July 20. This, the Sabbath, comes in with fog and light winds. So ends
this day. Total fish caught this week, 3,478.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They never worked on Sundays, but shaved, and washed themselves if it
were fine, and Pennsylvania sang hymns. Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) suggested
that, if it was not an impertinence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) could preach a
little. Uncle Salters nearly jumped down his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) throat at the mere notion,
reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) was not a preacher and mustn't think of such
things. We'd hev him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) rememberin' Johnstown next,'' Salters explained,
``an' what would happen then?'' So they compromised on his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) reading aloud
from a book called ``Josephus.'' It was an old leather-bound volume,
smelling of a hundred voyages, very solid and very like the Bible, but
enlivened with accounts of battles and sieges; and they read it nearly
from cover to cover. Otherwise Penn was a silent little body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) would
not utter a word for three days on end sometimes, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) played
checkers, listened to the songs, and laughed at the stories. When they
tried to stir him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) would answer. <div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to seem
unneighbourly, but it is because I have nothing to say. My head feels
quite empty. I've almost forgotten my name.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) would turn to Uncle
Salters with an expectant smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Pennsylvania Pratt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>Salters would shout. <div class="bookquote">``You'll fergit me next!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>Penn would say, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) lips firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Pennsylvania
Pratt, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) would repeat over and over. Sometimes it was
Uncle Salters who forgot, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) was Haskins or Rich or
McVitty; but Penn was equally content--till next time.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) was always very tender with Harvey, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) pitied both as a lost
child and as a lunatic; and when Salters saw that Penn liked the boy,
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) relaxed, too. Salters was not an amiable person -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) esteemed it his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
business to keep the boys in order-RRB-; and the first time Harvey, in fear
and trembling, on a still day, managed to shin up to the main-truck
-LRB-Dan was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) ready to help-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) esteemed it his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) duty to hang
Salters's big sea-boots up there--a sight of shame and derision to the
nearest schooner. With Disko, Harvey took no liberties; not even when
the old man dropped direct orders, and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), like the rest of
the crew, to <div class="bookquote">``Don't you want to do so and so?''  (<font color='red'><b>the crew</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Guess you'd
better,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and so forth. There was something about the clean-shaven lips
and the puckered corners of the eyes that was mightily sobering to
young blood.

<p/>Disko showed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the meaning of the thumbed and pricked chart, which,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, laid over any government publication whatsoever; led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
pencil in hand, from berth to berth over the whole string of banks--Le
Have, Western, Banquereau, St. Pierre, Green, and Grand--talking <div class="bookquote">``cod''
 (<font color='red'><b>Green</b></font>)</div>meantime. Taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>), too, the principle on which the <div class="bookquote">``hog-yoke''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was
worked.

<p/>In this Harvey excelled Dan, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had inherited a head for figures,
and the notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen
Bank sun appealed to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) keen wits. For other sea-matters his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) age
handicapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>). As Disko said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) should have begun when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was ten.
Dan could bait up trawl or lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) hand on any rope in the dark; and at
a pinch, when Uncle Salters had a gurry-sore on his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) palm, could dress
down by sense of touch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) could steer in anything short of half a gale
from the feel of the wind on his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) face, humouring the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>just
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) needed it. These things he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) did as automatically as he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) skipped
about the rigging, or made his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) dory a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) own will and body.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) could not communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) knowledge to Harvey.

<p/>Still there was a good deal of general information flying about the
schooner on stormy days, when they lay up in the fo`c`sle or sat on the
cabin lockers, while spare eye-bolts, leads, and rings rolled and
rattled in the pauses of the talk. Disko spoke of whaling voyages in
the Fifties; of great she-whales slain beside their young; of death
agonies on the black, tossing seas, and blood that spurted forty feet
in the air; of boats smashed to splinters; of patent rockets that went
off wrong-end-first and bombarded the trembling crews; of cutting-in
and boiling-down, and that terrible <div class="bookquote">``nip''  (<font color='red'><b>the crews</b></font>)</div>of '71, when twelve hundred
men were made homeless on the ice in three days--wonderful tales, all
true. But more wonderful still were his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) stories of the cod, and how
they argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below
the keel.

<p/>Long Jack's tastes ran more to the supernatural. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) held them silent
with ghastly stories of the <div class="bookquote">``Yo-hoes''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>on Monomoy Beach, that mock and
terrify lonely clam-diggers; of sand-walkers and dune-haunters who were
never properly buried; of hidden treasure on Fire Island guarded by the
spirits of Kidd's men; of ships that sailed in the fog straight over
Truro township; of that harbour in Maine where no one but a stranger
will lie at anchor twice in a certain place because of a dead crew who
row alongside at midnight with the anchor in the bow of their
old-fashioned boat, whistling--not calling, but whistling--for the soul
of the man who broke their rest.

<p/>Harvey had a notion that the east coast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) native land, from Mount
Desert south, was populated chiefly by people who took their horses
there in the summer and entertained in country-houses with hardwood
floors and Vantine portieres. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) laughed at the ghost-tales,--not as
much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) would have done a month before,--but ended by sitting still
and shuddering.

<p/>Tom Platt dealt with his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) interminable trip round the Horn on the old
Ohio in the flogging days, with a navy more extinct than the dodo--the
navy that passed away in the great war. He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) told them how red-hot shot
are dropped into a cannon, a wad of wet clay between them and the
cartridge; how they sizzle and reek when they strike wood, and how the
little ship-boys of the Miss Jim Buck hove water over them and shouted
to the fort to try again. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) told tales of blockade--long weeks of
swaying at anchor, varied only by the departure and return of steamers
that had used up their coal -LRB-there was no change for the
sailing-ships-RRB-; of gales and cold--cold that kept two hundred men,
night and day, pounding and chopping at the ice on cable, blocks, and
rigging, when the galley was as red-hot as the fort's shot, and men
drank cocoa by the bucket. Tom Platt had no use for steam. His (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) service
closed when that thing was comparatively new. He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) admitted that it was a
specious invention in time of peace, but looked hopefully for the day
when sails should come back again on ten-thousand-ton frigates with
hundred-and-ninety-foot booms.

<p/>Manuel's talk was slow and gentle--all about pretty girls in Madeira
washing clothes in the dry beds of streams, by moonlight, under waving
bananas; legends of saints, and tales of queer dances or fights away in
the cold Newfoundland baiting-ports. Salters was mainly agricultural;
for, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) read <div class="bookquote">``Josephus''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and expounded it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) mission in life
was to prove the value of green manures, and specially of clover,
against every form of phosphate whatsoever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) grew libellous about
phosphates; he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) dragged greasy <div class="bookquote">``Orange Judd''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>books from his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) bunk and
intoned them, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) finger at Harvey, to whom it was all Greek.
Little Penn was so genuinely pained when Harvey made fun of Salters's
lectures that the boy gave it up, and suffered in polite silence. That
was very good for Harvey.

<p/>The cook naturally did not join in these conversations. As a rule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
spoke only when it was absolutely necessary; but at times a queer gift
of speech descended on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) held forth, half in Gaelic, half in
broken English, an hour at a time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was specially communicative with
the boys, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) never withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) prophecy that one day Harvey would
be Dan's master, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) would see it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) told them of
mail-carrying in the winter up Cape Breton way, of the dog-train that
goes to Coudray, and of the ram-steamer Arctic, that breaks the ice
between the mainland and Prince Edward Island. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) told them
stories that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), of life far to the southward,
where water never froze; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) died his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) soul would
go to lie down on a warm white beach of sand with palm-trees waving
above. That seemed to the boys a very odd idea for a man who had never
seen a palm in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. Then, too, regularly at each meal, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
ask Harvey, and Harvey alone, whether the cooking was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) taste; and
this always made the <div class="bookquote">``second half''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>laugh. Yet they had a great respect
for the cook's judgment, and in their hearts considered Harvey
something of a mascot by consequence.

<p/>And while Harvey was taking in knowledge of new things at each pore and
hard health with every gulp of the good air, the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>went her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ways and did her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business on the Bank, and the silvery-grey kenches of
well-pressed fish mounted higher and higher in the hold. No one day's
work was out of the common, but the average days were many and close
together.

<p/>Naturally, a man of Disko's reputation was closely watched--<div class="bookquote">``scrowged
upon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan called it--by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) neighbours, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) had a very pretty knack
of giving them the slip through the curdling, glidy fog-banks. Disko
avoided company for two reasons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) wished to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) own experiments,
in the first place; and in the second, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) objected to the mixed
gatherings of a fleet of all nations. The bulk of them were mainly
Gloucester boats, with a scattering from Provincetown, Harwich,
Chatham, and some of the Maine ports, but the crews drew from goodness
knows where. Risk breeds recklessness, and when greed is added there
are fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded fleet,
which, like a mob of sheep, is huddled round some unrecognised leader.
<div class="bookquote">``Let the two Jeraulds lead 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``We're baound to lay among
'em fer a spell on the Eastern Shoals; though ef luck holds, we won't
hev to lay long. Where we are naow, Harve, ain't considered noways good
graound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, who was drawing water -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had learned just how
to wiggle the bucket-RRB-, after an unusually long dressing-down.
<div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't mind striking some poor ground for a change, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the graound I want to see--don't want to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>)--is Eastern
Point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. ``Say, dad, it looks 's if we wouldn't hev to lay
more'n two weeks on the Shoals. You'll meet all the comp`ny you want
then, Harve. That's the time we begin to work. No reg`lar meals fer no
one then. <div class="bookquote">``Mug-up when ye're hungry, an' sleep when ye can't keep
awake. Good job you wasn't picked up a month later than you was, or
we'd never ha' had you dressed in shape fer the Old Virgin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey understood from the Eldridge chart that the Old Virgin and a
nest of curiously named shoals were the turning-point of the cruise,
and that with good luck they would wet the balance of their salt there.
But seeing the size of the Virgin -LRB-it was one tiny dot-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) wondered
how even Disko with the hog-yoke and the lead could find her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
learned later that Disko was entirely equal to that and any other
business, and could even help others. A big four-by-five blackboard
hung in the cabin, and Harvey never understood the need of it till,
after some blinding thick days, they heard the unmelodious tooting of a
foot-power fog-horn--a machine whose note is as that of a consumptive
elephant.

<p/>They were making a short berth, towing the anchor under their foot to
save trouble. <div class="bookquote">``Squarerigger bellowin' fer his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) latitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long
Jack. The dripping red headsails of a bark glided out of the fog, and
the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>bell thrice</b></font>)</div>rang her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bell thrice, using sea shorthand.

<p/>The larger boat backed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) topsail with shrieks and shoutings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Frenchman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Salters, scornfully. <div class="bookquote">``Miquelon boat from St.
Malo.''  (<font color='red'><b>The farmer</b></font>)</div>The farmer had a weatherly sea-eye. <div class="bookquote">``I'm most outer `baccy, too,
Disko.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Same here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt. <div class="bookquote">``Hi! Backez vouz--backez vouz! Standez
awayez, you butt-ended mucho-bono! Where you from--St. Malo, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah, ha! Mucho bono! Oui! oui! Clos Poulet--St. Malo! St. Pierre et
Miquelon,'' cried the other crowd, waving woollen caps and laughing.
Then all together, <div class="bookquote">``Bord! Bord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring up the board, Danny. Beats me how them Frenchmen fetch
anywheres, exceptin' America's fairish broadly. Forty-six forty-nine's
good enough fer them; an' I guess it's abaout right, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan chalked the figures on the board, and they hung it in the
main-rigging to a chorus of mercis from the bark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seems kinder unneighbourly to let 'em swedge off like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>Salters
suggested, feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hev ye learned French then sence last trip'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
want no more stone-ballast hove at us `long o' your calm' Miquelon
boats `footy cochins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Le</b></font>)</div>same's you did off Le Have.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harmon Rush he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) said that was the way to rise 'em. Plain United States
is good enough fer me. We're all dretful short on terbakker. Young
feller, don't you speak French?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, valiantly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) bawled: <div class="bookquote">``Hi! Say! Arretez
vous! Attendez! Nous sommes venant pour tabac.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, tabac, tabac!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they cried, and laughed again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That hit 'em. Let's heave a dory over, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't exactly hold no certificates on French, but I know another lingo
that goes, I guess. Come on, Harve, an' interpret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The raffle and confusion when he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) and Harvey were hauled up the bark's
black side was indescribable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) cabin was all stuck round with
glaring coloured prints of the Virgin--the Virgin of Newfoundland, they
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>). Harvey found his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) French of no recognised Bank brand, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) conversation was limited to nods and grins. But Tom Platt waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)
arms and got along swimmingly. The captain gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) a drink of
unspeakable gin, and the opera-comique crew, with their hairy throats,
red caps, and long knives, greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) as a brother. Then the trade
began. They had tobacco, plenty of it--American, that had never paid
duty to France. They wanted chocolate and crackers. Harvey rowed back
to arrange with the cook and Disko, who owned the stores, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
return the cocoa-tins and cracker-bags were counted out by the
Frenchman's wheel. It looked like a piratical division of loot; but Tom
Platt came out of it roped with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of
chewing and smoking tobacco. Then those jovial mariners swung off into
the mist, and the last Harvey heard was a gay chorus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Par derriere chez ma tante, Il y a un bois joli, Et le rossignol y
chante Et le jour et la nuit... Que donneriez vous, belle, Qui
I`amènerait ici? Je donnerai Québec, Sorel et Saint Denis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was it my French didn't go, and your sign-talk did?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey
demanded when the barter had been distributed among the <div class="bookquote">``We're Heres'' (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sign-talk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>Platt guffawed. <div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, 'twas sign-talk, but a heap
older'n your French, Harve. Them French boats are chock-full o'
Freemasons, an' that's why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you a Freemason, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looks that way, don't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>man-o'war man Harvey</b></font>)</div>said the man-o'war's man, stuffing his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)
pipe; and Harvey had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon.



<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>The thing that struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) most was the exceedingly casual way in which
some craft loafed about the broad Atlantic. Fishing-boats, as Dan said,
were naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their
neighbours; but one expected better things of steamers. That was after
another interesting interview, when they had been chased for three
miles by a big lumbering old cattle-boat, all boarded over on the upper
deck, that smelt like a thousand cattle-pens. A very excited officer
yelled at them through a speaking-trumpet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lay and lollopped
helplessly on the water while Disko ran the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>under her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lee
and gave the skipper a piece of his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``Where might ye be--eh? Ye
don't deserve to be anywheres. You barn-yard tramps go hoggin' the road
on the high seas with no blame consideration fer your neighbours, an'
your eyes in your coffee-cups instid o' in your silly heads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this the skipper</b></font>)</div><p/>At this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about
Disko's own eyes. <div class="bookquote">``We haven't had an observation for three days. D'you
suppose we can run her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) blind?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wa-al, I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Disko retorted. <div class="bookquote">``What's come to your lead'? Et it'?
Can't ye smell bottom, or are them cattle too rank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What d'ye feed 'em?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Salters with intense seriousness, for
the smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They say they fall
off dretful on a v`yage. Dunno as it's any o' my business, but I've a
kind o' notion that oil-cake broke small an' sprinkled--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thunder!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said a cattle-man in a red jersey as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) looked over the
side. <div class="bookquote">``What asylum did they let His (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) Whiskers out of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Young feller,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>Salters began, standing up in the fore-rigging, <div class="bookquote">``let me
tell yeou `fore we go any further that I've--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div><p/>The officer on the bridge took off his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) cap with immense politeness.
<div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I've asked for my reckoning. If the
agricultural person with the hair will kindly shut his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) head, the
sea-green barnacle with the wall-eye may perhaps condescend to
enlighten us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naow you've made a show o' me, Salters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, angrily. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) could
not stand up to that particular sort of talk, and snapped out the
latitude and longitude without more lectures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Well, that's a boat-load of lunatics, sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said the skipper, as he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>)
rang up the engine-room and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the
schooner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of all the blamed fools, next to you, Salters, him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) an' his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) crowd are
abaout the likeliest I've ever seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko as the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''
 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>slid away. <div class="bookquote">``I was jest givin' him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) my jedgment on lullsikin' round these
waters like a lost child, an' you must cut in with your fool farmin'.
Can't ye never keep things sep`rate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey, Dan, and the others stood back, winking one to the other and
full of joy; but Disko and Salters wrangled seriously till evening,
Salters arguing that a cattle-boat was practically a barn on blue
water, and Disko insisting that, even if this were the case, decency
and fisher-pride demanded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) should have kept <div class="bookquote">``things sep`rate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Long Jack stood it in silence for a time,--an angry skipper makes an
unhappy crew,--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) spoke across the table after supper:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fwhat's the good o' bodderin' fwhat they'll say?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll tell that tale ag`in' us fer years--that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko.
<div class="bookquote">``Oil-cake sprinkled!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With salt, o' course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Salters, impenitent, reading the farming
reports from a week-old New York paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's plumb mortifyin' to all my feelin's,''  (<font color='red'><b>the skipper</b></font>)</div>the skipper went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't see ut that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, the peacemaker. ``Look at here,
Disko! Is there another packet afloat this day in this weather c`u'd
ha' met a tramp an', over an' above givin' her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) reckonin',--over an'
above that, I say,--c`u'd ha' discoorsed wid her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) quite intelligent on
the management av steers an' such at sea'? Forgit ut! Av coorse they
will not. <div class="bookquote">``Twas the most compenjus conversation that iver accrued.
Double game an' twice runnin'--all to us.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Dan kicked Harvey under the
table, and Harvey choked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) cup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Salters, who felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) honour had been somewhat

saw no weed, nor gulls, nor schooners; an' prisintly they obsarved
they'd been out a matter o' fourteen days, and they mistrusted the Bank
had suspinded payment. So they sounded, an' got sixty fathom. ``That's

 (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div><p/>Long Jack winked one tremendous wink that embraced all hands except
Disko and Salters, and the incident was closed.

<p/>Then they made berth after berth to the northward, the dories out
almost every day, running along the east edge of the Grand Bank in
thirty-to forty-fathom water, and fishing steadily.

<p/>It was here Harvey first met the squid, who is one of the best
cod-baits, but uncertain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) moods. They were waked out of their
bunks one black night by yells of <div class="bookquote">``Squid O!''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>from Salters, and for an
hour and a half every soul aboard hung over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) squid-jig--a piece of
lead painted red and armed at the lower end with a circle of pins bent
backward like half-opened umbrella ribs. The squid--for some unknown
reason--likes, and wraps himself round, this thing, and is hauled up
ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) can escape from the pins. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) home he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) squirts
first water and next ink into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) captor's face; and it was curious to
see the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge the shot.
They were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended; but a pile of fresh
squid lay on the deck, and the large cod thinks very well of a little
shiny piece of squid-tentacle at the tip of a clam-baited hook. Next
day they caught many fish, and met the Carrie Pitman, to whom they
shouted their luck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) wanted to trade--seven cod for one
fair-sized squid; but Disko would not agree at the price, and the
Carrie dropped sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away, in
the hope of striking on to some for herself.

<p/>Disko said nothing till after supper, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrie</b></font>) sent Dan and Manuel out
to buoy the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here's''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>cable and announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrie</b></font>) intention of turning
in with the broad-axe. Dan naturally repeated these remarks to a dory
from the Carrie, who wanted to know why they were buoying their cable,
since they were not on rocky bottom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dad sez he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) wouldn't trust a ferryboat within five mile o' you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan
howled cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) git out, then'? Who's hinderin'?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cause you've jest the same ez lee-bowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>), an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) don't take that
from any boat, not to speak o' sech a driftin' gurry-butt as you be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ain't driftin' any this trip,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, angrily, for the
Carrie Pitman had an unsavoury reputation for breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>)
ground-tackle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then haow d'you make berths?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``It's her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) best p`int o'
sailin'. An' ef she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s quit driftin', what in thunder are you doin' with
a new jib-boom?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That shot went home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey, you Portugoosy organ-grinder, take your monkey back to
Gloucester. Go back to school, Dan Troop,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O-ver-alls! O-ver-alls!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>yelled Dan, who knew that one of the Carrie's
crew had worked in an overall factory the winter before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shrimp! Gloucester shrimp! Git aout, you Novy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a Gloucester man</b></font>)</div><p/>To call a Gloucester man a Nova Scotian is not well received. Dan
answered in kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Novy yourself, ye Scrabble-towners! ye Chatham wreckers' Git aout with
your brick in your stock in'!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the forces separated, but Chatham
had the worst of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew haow `twould be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s drawed the wind raound
already. Some one oughter put a deesist on thet packet. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll snore
till midnight, an' jest when we're gittin' our sleep she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll strike
adrift. Good job we ain't crowded with craft hereaways. But I ain't
goin' to up anchor fer Chatham. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) may hold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The wind, which had hauled round, rose at sundown and blew steadily.
There was not enough sea, though, to disturb even a dory's tackle, but
the Carrie Pitman was a law unto herself. At the end of the boys' watch
they heard the crack-crack-crack of a huge muzzle-loading revolver
aboard her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glory, glory, hallelujah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>sung Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) comes, dad; butt-end
first, walkin' in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sleep same's she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) done on `Queereau.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) been any other boat Disko would have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) chances, but now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) cut the cable as the Carrie Pitman, with all the North Atlantic to
play in, lurched down directly upon them. The <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'' (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>, under jib
and riding-sail, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) no more room than was absolutely
necessary,--Disko did not wish to spend a week hunting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
cable,--but scuttled up into the wind as the Carrie passed within easy
hail, a silent and angry boat, at the mercy of a raking broadside of
Bank chaff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evenin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) headgear, <div class="bookquote">``an' haow does your
garden grow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to Ohio an' hire a mule,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Salters. <div class="bookquote">``We don't want no

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will I lend you my dory-anchor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Long</b></font>)</div>cried Long Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unship your rudder an' stick it in the mud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan's voice rose shrill and high, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) stood on the wheel-box.
<div class="bookquote">``Sa-ay! Is there a strike in the o-ver-all factory; or hev they hired
girls, ye Shackamaxons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Veer out the tiller-lines,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>cried Harvey, <div class="bookquote">``and nail 'em to the
bottom.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>That was a salt-flavoured jest he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had been put up to by Tom
Platt. Manuel leaned over the stern and yelled; <div class="bookquote">``Johnna Morgan play the
organ! Ahaaaa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) flourished his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) broad thumb with a gesture of
unspeakable contempt and derision, while little Penn covered himself
with glory by piping up: <div class="bookquote">``Gee a little! Hssh! Come here. Haw!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div><p/>They rode on their chain for the rest of the night, a short, snappy,
uneasy motion, as Harvey found, and wasted half the forenoon recovering
the cable. But the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of
triumph and glory, and they thought with grief over all the beautiful
things that they might have said to the discomfited Carrie.



<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>Next day they fell in with more sails, all circling slowly from the
east northerly towards the west. But just when they expected to make
the shoals by the Virgin the fog shut down, and they anchored,
surrounded by the tinklings of invisible bells. There was not much
fishing, but occasionally dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news.

<p/>That night, a little before dawn, Dan and Harvey, who had been sleeping
most of the day, tumbled out to <div class="bookquote">``hook''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>fried pies. There was no reason
why they should not have taken them openly; but they tasted better so,
and it made the cook angry. The heat and smell below drove them on deck
with their plunder, and they found Disko at the bell, which he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) handed
over to Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) goin',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I mistrust I hear somethin'. Ef it's
anything, I'm best where I am so's to get at things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a forlorn little jingle; the thick air seemed to pinch it off;
and in the pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liner's siren,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) knew enough of the Banks to know what that meant. It came to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>), with horrible distinctness, how a boy in a cherry-coloured
jersey--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) despised fancy blazers now with all a fisherman's
contempt--how an ignorant, rowdy boy had once said it would be <div class="bookquote">``great''
 (<font color='red'><b>an boy</b></font>)</div>if a steamer ran down a fishing-boat. That boy had a state-room with a
hot and cold bath, and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a
gilt-edged bill of fare. And that same boy--no, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) very much older
brother--was up at four of the dim dawn in streaming, crackling
oilskins, hammering, literally for the dear life, on a bell smaller
than the steward's breakfast-bell, while somewhere close at hand a
thirty-foot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour! The
bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry,
upholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat
before breakfast. So Harvey rang the bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they slow daown one turn o' their blame propeller,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan,
applying himself to Manuel's conch, <div class="bookquote">``fer to keep inside the law, an'
that's consolin' when we're all at the bottom. Hark to her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>)' She (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>)'s a
humper!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aoooo--whoooo--whupp!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went the siren. <div class="bookquote">``Wingle--tingle--tink,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went
the bell. <div class="bookquote">``Graaa--ouch!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went the conch, while sea and sky were all
milled up in milky fog. Then Harvey felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was near a moving
body, and found himself looking up and up at the wet edge of a
cliff-like bow, leaping, it seemed, directly over the schooner. A
jaunty little feather of water curled in front of it, and as it lifted
it showed a long ladder of Roman numerals--XV., XVI., XVII., XVIII.,
and so forth--on a salmon-coloured, gleaming side. It tilted forward
and downward with a heart-stilling <div class="bookquote">``Ssssooo'' (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>; the ladder disappeared; a
line of brass-rimmed port-holes flashed past; a jet of Steam puffed in
Harvey's helplessly uplifted hands; a spout of hot water roared along
the rail of the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'' (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>, and the little schooner staggered and
shook in a rush of screw-torn water, as a liner's stern vanished in the
fog. Harvey got ready to faint or be sick, or both, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) heard a
crack like a trunk thrown on a sidewalk, and, all small in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) ear, a
far-away telephone voice drawling: <div class="bookquote">``Heave to! You've sunk us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it us?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Boat out yonder. Ring! We're goin' to look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, running out
a dory.

<p/>In half a minute all except Harvey, Penn, and the cook were overside
and away. Presently a schooner's stump-foremast, snapped clean across,
drifted past the bows. Then an empty green dory came by, knocking on
the ``We're Here's' side, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) wished to be taken in. Then
followed something, face down, in a blue jersey, but it was not the
whole of a man. Penn changed colour and caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath with a click.
Harvey pounded despairingly at the bell, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) feared they might be
sunk at any minute, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) jumped at Dan's hail as the crew came back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Jennie Cushman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, hysterically, <div class="bookquote">``cut clean in
half--graound up an' trompled on at that! Not a quarter of a mile away.
Dad's got the old man. There ain't any one else, and--there was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)
son, too. Oh, Harve, Harve, I can't stand it! I've seen--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) dropped
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) arms and sobbed while the others dragged a grey-headed
man aboard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you pick me up for?''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>the stranger groaned. <div class="bookquote">``Disko, what did
you pick me up for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko dropped a heavy hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) shoulder, for the man's eyes were
wild and his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) lips trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) stared at the silent crew. Then up and
spoke Pennsylvania Pratt, who was also Haskins or Rich or McVitty when
Uncle Salters forgot; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) face was changed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) from the face of
a fool to the countenance of an old, wise man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a strong
voice: <div class="bookquote">``The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
name of the Lord! I was--I am a minister of the Gospel. Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you be, be you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``Then pray my son back to me! Pray
back a nine-thousand-dollar boat an' a thousand quintal of fish. If
you'd left me alone my widow could ha' gone on to the Provident an'
worked fer her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) board, an' never known--an' never known. Now I'll hev to
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't nothin' to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``Better lie down a piece,
Jason Olley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>When a man has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only son, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) summer's work, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) means of
livelihood, in thirty counted seconds, it is hard to give consolation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All Gloucester men, wasn't they,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>said Tom Platt, fiddling helplessly
with a dory-becket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that don't make no odds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jason</b></font>)</div>said Jason, wringing the wet from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>)
beard. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be rowin' summer boarders araound East Gloucester this
fall.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) rolled heavily to the rail, singing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy birds that sing and fly Round thine altars, O Most High!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with me. Come below!''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>said Penn, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) had a right to give
orders. Their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dunno who you be, but I'll come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jason</b></font>)</div>said Jason, submissively. <div class="bookquote">``Mebbe
I'll get back some o' the--some o' the--nine thousand dollars.''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>Penn
led him (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) into the cabin and slid the door behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That ain't Penn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>cried Uncle Salters. <div class="bookquote">``It's Jacob Boiler, an'--he (<font color='blue'><b>Boiler</b></font>)'s
remembered Johnstown! I never seed such eyes in any livin' man's head.
What's to do naow? What'll I do naow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div><p/>They could hear Penn's voice and Jason's together. Then Penn's went on
alone, and Salters slipped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) hat, for Penn was praying. Presently
the little man came up the steps, huge drops of sweat on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and
looked at the crew. Dan was still sobbing by the wheel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't know us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>Salters groaned. <div class="bookquote">``It's all to do over again,
checkers and everything--an' what'll he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div><p/>Penn spoke; they could hear that it was to strangers. <div class="bookquote">``I have prayed,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Our people believe in prayer. I have prayed for the life of
this man's son. Mine were drowned before my eyes--she (<font color='blue'><b>Boiler</b></font>) and my eldest

never for their lives, but I have prayed for this man's son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
will surely be sent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div><p/>Salters looked pleadingly at Penn to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) remembered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long have I been mad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>Penn asked suddenly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) mouth was
twitching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw, Penn! You weren't never mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>Salters began. <div class="bookquote">``Only a little
distracted like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw the houses strike the bridge before the fires broke out. I do

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stand it! I can't stand it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>cried Dan, and Harvey whimpered
in sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Abaout five year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, in a shaking voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I have been a charge on some one for every day of that time. Who
was the man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko pointed to Salters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye hain't--ye hain't!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the sea-farmer, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) hands
together. <div class="bookquote">``Ye've more'n earned your keep twice-told; an' there's money
owin' you, Penn, besides ha'af o' my quarter-share in the boat, which

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are good men. I can see that in your faces. But--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother av Mercy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>whispered Long Jack, <div class="bookquote">``an' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been wid us all these

 (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div><p/>A schooner's bell struck up alongside, and a voice hailed through the
fog: ``O Disko! <div class="bookquote">``Heard abaout the Jennie Cushman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have found his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Penn. <div class="bookquote">``Stand you still and see the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Got Jason aboard here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>Disko answered, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) voice quavered.
<div class="bookquote">``There--warn't any one else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``We've f`und one, though. <div class="bookquote">``Run acrost him (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) snarled up in a mess o'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The <div class="bookquote">``We're Heres'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>heart-beats answered one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess it's young Olley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>the voice drawled.

<p/>Penn raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) hands and said something in German. Harvey could have
sworn that a bright sun was shining upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lifted face; but the drawl
went on: <div class="bookquote">``Sa-ay! You fellers guyed us consid`rable t`other night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't feel like guyin' any now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it; but to tell the honest truth we was kinder--kinder driftin'
when we run ag`in' young Olley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Carrie Pitman/Carrie</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the irrepressible Carrie Pitman, and a roar of unsteady laughter
went up from the deck of the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'' (<font color='red'><b>Carrie Pitman/Carrie</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>``Hedn't you `baout's well send the old man aboard? We're runnin' in fer

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you anything in the boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't want nothin', `less, mebbe, an anchor that'll hold. Say! Young
Olley's gittin' kinder baulky an' excited. Send the old man along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div><p/>Penn waked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) stupor of despair, and Tom Platt rowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)
over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) went away without a word of thanks, not knowing what was to
come; and the fog closed over all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>said Penn, drawing a deep breath as though about to preach.
<div class="bookquote">``And now'' (<font color='red'><b>Pennsylvania Pratt/Pratt</b></font>)</div>--the erect body sank like a sword driven home into the
scabbard; the light faded from the overbright eyes; the voice returned
to its usual pitiful little titter--<div class="bookquote">``and now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pennsylvania Pratt/Pratt</b></font>)</div>said Pennsylvania
Pratt, <div class="bookquote">``do you think it's too early for a little game of checkers, Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>Pennsylvania Pratt/Pratt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing--the very thing I was goin' to say myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>cried
Salters, promptly. <div class="bookquote">``It beats all, Penn, how you git on to what's in a
man's mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>The little fellow blushed and meekly followed Salters forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Up anchor! Hurry! Let's quit these crazy waters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>shouted Disko, and
never was he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) more swiftly obeyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now what in creation d'ye suppose is the meanin' o' that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said
Long Jack, when they were working through the fog once more, damp,
dripping, and bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The way I sense it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, at the wheel, <div class="bookquote">``is this: The Jennie
Cushman business comin' on an empty stummick--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--we saw one of them go by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>sobbed Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' that, o' course, kinder hove him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outer water, Julluk runnin' a
craft ashore; hove him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right aout, I take it, to rememberin' Johnstown
an' Jacob Boiler an' such-like reminiscences. Well, consolin' Jason
there held him (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) up a piece, same's shorin' up a boat. Then, bein' weak,
them props slipped an' slipped, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) slided down the ways, an' naow
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>)'s water-borne ag`in. That's haow I sense it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>They decided that Disko was entirely correct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Twould ha' bruk Salters all up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, <div class="bookquote">``if Penn had stayed
Jacob Bollerin'. Did ye see his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) face when Penn asked who he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)'d been
charged on all these years'? How is ut, Salters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Asleep--dead asleep. Turned in like a child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>Salters replied,
tiptoeing aft. <div class="bookquote">``There won't be no grub till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) wakes, natural. Did ye
ever see sech a gift in prayer? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) everlastin`ly hiked young Olley
outer the ocean. Thet's my belief. Jason was tur`ble praoud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) boy,
an' I mistrusted all along 'twas a jedgment on worshippin' vain idols.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's others jest as sot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's dif`runt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>Salters retorted quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Penn's not all caulked,
an' I ain't only but doin' my duty by him (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>those men hours</b></font>)</div><p/>They waited, those hungry men, three hours, till Penn reappeared with a
smooth face and a blank mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been
dreaming. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wanted to know why they were so silent, and they
could not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).

<p/>Disko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days; and
when they could not go out, turned them into the hold to stack the
ship's stores into smaller compass, to make more room for the fish. The
packed mass ran from the cabin partition to the sliding door behind the
fo`c`sle stove; and Disko showed how there is great art in stowing
cargo so as to bring a schooner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Disko</b></font>) best draft. The crew were thus
kept lively till they recovered their spirits; and Harvey was tickled
with a rope's end by Long Jack for being, as the Galway man said,
<div class="bookquote">``sorrowful as a sick cat over fwhat couldn't be helped.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Galway man</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did a great
deal of thinking in those dreary days; and told Dan what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) thought,
and Dan agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)--even to the extent of asking for fried pies
instead of hooking them.

<p/>But a week later the two nearly upset the Hattie S. in a wild attempt
to stab a shark with an old bayonet tied to a stick. The grim brute
rubbed alongside the dory begging for small fish, and between the three
of them it was a mercy they all got off alive.

<p/>At last, after playing blindman's-buff in the fog, there came a morning
when Disko shouted down the fo`c`sle: <div class="bookquote">``Hurry, boys! We're in taown!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>To the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>S.</b></font>) days, Harvey will never forget that sight. The sun
was just clear of the horizon they had not seen for nearly a week, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>S.</b></font>) low red light struck into the riding-sails of three fleets of
anchored schooners--one to the north, one to the westward, and one to
the south. There must have been nearly a hundred of them, of every
possible make and build, with, far away, a square-rigged Frenchman, all
bowing and courtesying one to the other. From every boat dories were
dropping away like bees from a crowded hive; and the clamour of voices,
the rattling of ropes and blocks, and the splash of the oars carried
for miles across the heaving water. The sails turned all colours,
black, pearly-grey, and white, as the sun mounted; and more boats swung
up through the mists to the southward.

<p/>The dories gathered in clusters, separated, reformed, and broke again,
all heading one way; while men hailed and whistled and cat-called and
sang, and the water was speckled with rubbish thrown overboard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``Disko was right. It is a town!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen smaller,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``There's about a thousand men here;
an' yonder's the Virgin.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) pointed to a vacant space of greenish sea,
where there were no dories.

<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>skirted round the northern squadron, Disko waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
hand to friend after friend, and anchored as neatly as a racing yacht
at the end of the season. The Bank fleet pass good seamanship in
silence; but a bungler is jeered all along the line.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jest in time fer the caplin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cried the Mary Chilton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Salt `most wet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>asked the King Philip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey, Tom Platt! Come t' supper to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said the Henry Clay; and so
questions and answers flew back and forth. Men had met one another
before, dory-fishing in the fog, and there is no place for gossip like
the Bank fleet. They all seemed to know about Harvey's rescue, and
asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) were worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) salt yet. The young bloods jested with Dan,
who had a lively tongue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) own, and inquired after their health by
the town--nicknames they least liked. Manuel's countrymen jabbered at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) in their own language; and even the silent cook was seen riding the
jib-boom and shouting Gaelic to a friend as black as himself. After
they had buoyed the cable--all around the Virgin is rocky bottom, and
carelessness means chafed ground-tackle and danger from drifting--after
they had buoyed the cable, their dories went forth to join the mob of
boats anchored about a mile away. The schooners rocked and dipped at a
safe distance, like mother ducks watching their brood, while the dories
behaved like mannerless ducklings.

<p/>As they drove into the confusion, boat banging boat, Harvey's ears
tingled at the comments on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) rowing. Every dialect from Labrador to
Long Island, with Portuguese, Neapolitan, Lingua Franca, French, and
Gaelic, with songs and shoutings and new oaths, rattled round him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) seemed to be the butt of it all. For the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)
felt shy--perhaps that came from living so long with only the <div class="bookquote">``We're
Heres'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--among the scores of wild faces that rose and fell with the
reeling small craft. A gentle, breathing swell, three furlongs from
trough to barrel, would quietly shoulder up a string of variously
painted dories. They hung for an instant, a wonderful frieze against
the sky-line, and their men pointed and hailed, Next moment the open
mouths, waving arms, and bare chests disappeared, while on another
swell came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in
a toy theatre. So Harvey stared. <div class="bookquote">``Watch out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, flourishing a
dip-net. <div class="bookquote">``When I tell you dip, you dip. The caplin'll school any time
from naow on. Where'll we lay, Tom Platt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/>Pushing, shoving, and hauling, greeting old friends here and warning
old enemies there, Commodore Tom Platt led his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) little fleet well to
leeward of the general crowd, and immediately three or four men began
to haul on their anchors with intent to lee-bow the <div class="bookquote">``We're Heres'' (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>. But
a yell of laughter went up as a dory shot from her (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) station with
exceeding speed, its occupant pulling madly on the roding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) slack!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>roared twenty voices. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) shake it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, as the boat flashed away to the
southward. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)'s anchored, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anchored, sure enough, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) graound-tackle's kinder shifty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said
Dan, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Whale's fouled it... Dip, Harve! Here they come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sea round them clouded and darkened, and then frizzed up in showers
of tiny silver fish, and over a space of five or six acres the cod
began to leap like trout in May; while behind the cod three or four
broad grey-black backs broke the water into boils.

<p/>Then everybody shouted and tried to haul up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) anchor to get among the
school, and fouled his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) neighbour's line and said what was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) heart,
and dipped furiously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) dip-net, and shrieked cautions and advice
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) companions, while the deep fizzed like freshly opened
soda-water, and cod, men, and whales together flung in upon the
luckless bait. Harvey was nearly knocked overboard by the handle of
Dan's net. But in all the wild tumult he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) noticed, and never forgot, the
wicked, set little eye--something like a circus elephant's eye--of a
whale that drove along almost level with the water, and, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said,
winked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>). Three boats found their rodings fouled by these reckless
mid-sea hunters, and were towed half a mile ere their horses shook the
line free.

<p/>Then the caplin moved off and five minutes later there was no sound
except the splash of the sinkers overside, the flapping of the cod, and
the whack of the muckles as the men stunned them. It was wonderful
fishing. Harvey could see the glimmering cod below, swimming slowly in
droves, biting as steadily as they swam. Bank law strictly forbids more
than one hook on one line when the dories are on the Virgin or the
Eastern Shoals; but so close lay the boats that even single hooks
snarled, and Harvey found himself in hot argument with a gentle, hairy
Newfoundlander on one side and a howling Portuguese on the other.

<p/>Worse than any tangle of fishing-lines was the confusion of the
dory-rodings below water. Each man had anchored where it seemed good to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), drifting and rowing round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fixed point. As the fish struck on
less quickly, each man wanted to haul up and get to better ground; but
every third man found himself intimately connected with some four or
five neighbours. To cut another's roding is crime unspeakable on the
Banks; yet it was done, and done without detection, three or four times
that day. Tom Platt caught a Maine man in the black act and knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>)
over the gunwale with an oar, and Manuel served a fellow-countryman in
the same way. But Harvey's anchor-line was cut, and so was Penn's, and
they were turned into relief-boats to carry fish to the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>as
the dories filled. The caplin schooled once more at twilight, when the
mad clamour was repeated; and at dusk they rowed back to dress down by
the light of kerosene-lamps on the edge of the pen.

<p/>It was a huge pile, and they went to sleep while they were dressing.
Next day several boats fished right above the cap of the Virgin; and
Harvey, with them, looked down on the very weed of that lonely rock,
which rises to within twenty feet of the surface. The cod were there in
legions, marching solemnly over the leathery kelp. When they bit, they
bit all together; and so when they stopped. There was a slack time at
noon, and the dories began to search for amusement. It was Dan who
sighted the Hope of Prague just coming up, and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) boats joined the
company they were greeted with the question: <div class="bookquote">``Who's the meanest man in
the Fleet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Three hundred voices answered cheerily:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nick Bra-ady.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It sounded an organ chant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who stole the lamp-wicks?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>That was Dan's contribution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nick Bra-ady,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sang the boats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who biled the salt bait fer soup?''  (<font color='red'><b>This an backbiter quarter</b></font>)</div>This was an unknown backbiter a
quarter of a mile away.

<p/>Again the joyful chorus. Now, Brady was not especially mean, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brady</b></font>) had
that reputation, and the Fleet made the most of it. Then they
discovered a man from a Truro boat who, six years before, had been
convicted of using a tackle with five or six hooks--a <div class="bookquote">``scrowger,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>they
call it--on the Shoals. Naturally, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been christened <div class="bookquote">``Scrowger Jim'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>;
and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hidden himself on the Georges ever since, he (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) found
his (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) honours waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) full blown. They took it up in a sort of
fire-cracker chorus: <div class="bookquote">``Jim! O Jim! Jim! O Jim! Sssscrowger Jim!''  (<font color='red'><b>That everybody</b></font>)</div>That
pleased everybody. And when a poetical Beverly man--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been making
it up all day, and talked about it for weeks--sang, <div class="bookquote">``The Carrie
Pitman's anchor doesn't hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) for a cent!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the dories felt that they
were indeed fortunate. Then they had to ask that Beverly man how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
off for beans, because even poets must not have things all their own
way. Every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn. Was there a
careless or dirty cook anywhere? The dories sang about him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
food. Was a schooner badly found? The Fleet was told at full length.
Had a man hooked tobacco from a messmate? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was named in meeting; the
name tossed from roller to roller. Disko's infallible judgments, Long
Jack's market-boat that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had sold years ago, Dan's sweetheart -LRB-oh,
but Dan was an angry boy!-RRB-, Penn's bad luck with dory-anchors,
Salters's views on manure, Manuel's little slips from virtue ashore,
and Harvey's ladylike handling of the oar--all were laid before the
public; and as the fog fell around them in silvery sheets beneath the
sun, the voices sounded like a bench of invisible judges pronouncing
sentence.

<p/>The dories roved and fished and squabbled till a swell underran the
sea. Then they drew more apart to save their sides, and some one called
that if the swell continued the Virgin would break. A reckless Galway
man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew denied this, hauled up anchor, and rowed over the
very rock itself. Many voices called them to come away, while others
dared them to hold on. As the smooth-backed rollers passed to the
south-ward, they hove the dory high and high into the mist, and dropped
her (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) in ugly, sucking, dimpled water, where she (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) spun round her (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) anchor,
within a foot or two of the hidden rock. It was playing with death for
mere bravado; and the boats looked on in uneasy silence till Long Jack
rowed up behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) countrymen and quietly cut their roding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't ye hear ut knockin'?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Pull for your miserable lives!
Pull!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted; but the next
swell checked a little, like a man tripping on a carpet. There was a
deep sob and a gathering roar, and the Virgin flung up a couple of
acres of foaming water, white, furious, and ghastly over the shoal sea.
Then all the boats greatly applauded Long Jack, and the Galway men held
their tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't it elegant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, bobbing like a young seal at home.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>)'ll break about once every ha'af hour now, `less the swell piles up
good. What's her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) reg`lar time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>)'s at work, Tom Platt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once ivry fifteen minutes, to the tick. Harve, you've seen the
greatest thing on the Banks; an' but for Long Jack you'd seen some dead
men too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the
schooners were ringing their bells. A big bark nosed cautiously out of
the mist, and was received with shouts and cries of, <div class="bookquote">``Come along,
darlin',''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from the Irishry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another Frenchman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hain't you eyes? She (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>)'s a Baltimore boat; goin' in fear an' tremblin',''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. ``We'll guy the very sticks out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Guess it's the fust
time her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) skipper ever met up with the Fleet this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) was a black, buxom, eight-hundred-ton craft. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) mainsail was
looped up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) topsail flapped undecidedly in what little wind was
moving. Now a bark is feminine beyond all other daughters of the sea,
and this tall, hesitating creature, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) white and gilt figurehead,
looked just like a bewildered woman half lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) skirts to cross a
muddy street under the jeers of bad little boys. That was very much her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>)
situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the
Virgin, had caught the roar of it, and was, therefore, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) way.
This is a small part of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) heard from the dancing dories:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Virgin? Fwhat are you talk in' of'? This is Le Have on a Sunday
mornin'. Go home an' sober up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go home, ye tarrapin! Go home an' tell 'em we're comin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div><p/>Half a dozen voices together, in a most tuneful chorus, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) stern
went down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs:
<div class="bookquote">``Thay-aah--she (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>)--strikes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hard up! Hard up fer your life! You're on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Daown! Hard daown! Let go everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All hands to the pumps!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Daown jib an' pole her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the skipper</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the skipper lost his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) temper and said things. Instantly fishing was
suspended to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) heard many curious facts about his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) boat
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Virgin</b></font>) next port of call. They asked him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) were insured; and
whence he (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) had stolen his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) anchor, because, they said, it belonged to the
Carrie Pitman; they called his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) boat a mud-scow, and accused him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) of
dumping garbage to frighten the fish; they offered to tow him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) and
charge it to his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) wife; and one audacious youth slipped almost under the
counter, smacked it with his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) open palm, and yelled: <div class="bookquote">``Gid up, Buck!''

 (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div><p/>The cook emptied a pan of ashes on him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) replied with cod-heads.
The bark's crew fired small coal from the galley, and the dories
threatened to come aboard and <div class="bookquote">``razee''  (<font color='red'><b>bark crew</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). They would have warned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
at once had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) been in real peril; but, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) well clear of the
Virgin, they made the most of their chances. The fun was spoilt when
the rock spoke again, a half-mile to windward, and the tormented bark
set everything that would draw and went her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ways; but the dories felt
that the honours lay with them.

<p/>All that night the Virgin roared hoarsely and next morning, over an
angry, white-headed sea, Harvey saw the Fleet with flickering masts
waiting for a lead. Not a dory was hove out till ten o'clock, when the
two Jeraulds of the Day's Eye, imagining a lull which did not exist,
set the example. In a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the
cockly swells, but Troop kept the <div class="bookquote">``We're Heres''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>at work dressing-down.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) saw no sense in <div class="bookquote">``dares'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>; and as the storm grew that evening they had
the pleasure of receiving wet strangers only too glad to make any
refuge in the gale. The boys stood by the dory-tackles with lanterns,
the men ready to haul, one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that would
make them drop everything and hold on for the dear life. Out of the
dark would come a yell of <div class="bookquote">``Dory, dory!''  (<font color='red'><b>a man boat</b></font>)</div>They would hook up and haul in
a drenched man and a half-sunk boat, till their decks were littered
down with nests of dories and the bunks were full. Five times in their
watch did Harvey, with Dan, jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on
the boom, and cling with arms, legs, and teeth to rope and spar and
sodden canvas as a big wave filled the decks. One dory was smashed to
pieces, and the sea pitched the man head first on to the decks, cutting
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead open; and about dawn, when the racing seas glimmered white
all along their cold edges, another man, blue and ghastly, crawled in
with a broken hand, asking news of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother. Seven extra mouths sat
down to breakfast: a Swede; a Chatham skipper; a boy from Hancock,
Maine; one Duxbury, and three Provincetown men.

<p/>There was a general sorting out among the Fleet next day; and though no
one said anything, all ate with better appetites when boat after boat
reported full crews aboard. Only a couple of Portuguese and an old man
from Gloucester were drowned, but many were cut or bruised; and two
schooners had parted their tackle and been blown to the southward,
three days' sail. A man died on a Frenchman--it was the same bark that
had traded tobacco with the <div class="bookquote">``We're Heres'' (<font color='red'><b>a Frenchman</b></font>)</div>. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slipped away quite
quietly one wet, white morning, moved to a patch of deep water, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sails all hanging anyhow, and Harvey saw the funeral through Disko's
spy-glass. It was only an oblong bundle slid overside. They did not
seem to have any form of service, but in the night, at anchor, Harvey
heard them across the star-powdered black water, singing something that
sounded like a hymn. It went to a very slow tune.

<p/>La brigantine Qui va tourner, Roule et s`incline Pour m`entrainer. Oh,
Vierge Marie, Pour moi priez Dieu! Adieu, patrie; Québec, adieu!

<p/>Tom Platt visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), because, he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) said, the dead man was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother
as a Freemason. It came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow
over the heel of the bowsprit and broken his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back. The news spread like
a flash, for, contrary to general custom, the Frenchman held an auction
of the dead man's kit,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no friends at St. Malo or Miquelon,--and
everything was spread out on the top of the house, from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) red knitted
cap to the leather belt with the sheath-knife at the back. Dan and
Harvey were out on twenty-fathom water in the Hattie S., and naturally
rowed over to join the crowd. It was a long pull, and they stayed some
little time while Dan bought the knife, which had a curious brass
handle. When they dropped overside and pushed off into a drizzle of
rain and a lop of sea, it occurred to them that they might get into
trouble for neglecting the lines. <div class="bookquote">``Guess `twon't hurt us any to be
warmed up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, shivering under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) oilskins, and they rowed on
into the heart of a white fog, which, as usual, dropped on them without
warning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's too much blame tide hereabouts to trust to your instinks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Heave over the anchor, Harve, and we'll fish a piece till the
thing lifts. Bend on your biggest lead. Three pound ain't any too much
in this water. See how she (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>)'s tightened on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) rodin' already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was quite a little bubble at the bows, where some irresponsible
Bank current held the dory full stretch on her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) rope; but they could not
see a boat's length in any direction. Harvey turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) collar and
bunched himself over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) reel with the air of a wearied navigator. Fog
had no special terrors for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) now. They fished awhile in silence, and
found the cod struck on well. Then Dan drew the sheath-knife and tested
the edge of it on the gunwale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a daisy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``How did you get it so cheap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On account o' their blame Cath`lic superstitions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, jabbing
with the bright blade. ``They don't fancy takin' iron frum off of a dead
man, so to speak. <div class="bookquote">``See them Arichat Frenchmen step back when I bid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But an auction ain't taking anything off a dead man. It's business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We know it ain't, but there's no goin' in the teeth o' superstition.
That's one o' the advantages o' livin' in a progressive country.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>And
Dan began whistling:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Double Thatcher, how are you? Now Eastern Point comes inter view.
The girls an' boys we soon shall see, At anchor off Cape Ann!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't that Eastport man bid, then? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boots. Ain't
Maine progressive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maine? Pshaw! They don't know enough, or they hain't got money enough,
to paint their haouses in Maine. I've seen 'em. The Eastport man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
told me that the knife had been used--so the French captain told
him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)--used up on the French coast last year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cut a man? Heave's the muckle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey hauled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) fish, rebaited,
and threw over.

<p/>``Killed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! <div class="bookquote">``Course, when I heard that I was keener 'n ever to get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Christmas! I didn't know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, turning round. <div class="bookquote">``I'll give
you a dollar for it when I--get my wages. Say, I'll give you two
dollars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Honest? D'you like it as much as all that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, flushing. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
to tell the truth, I kinder got it for you--to give; but I didn't let
on till I saw how you'd take it. It's yours and welcome, Harve, because
we're dory-mates, and so on and so forth, an' so followin'. Catch
a-holt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) held it out, belt and all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But look at here. Dan, I don't see--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Take it. <div class="bookquote">``Tain't no use to me. I wish you to hev it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The temptation was irresistible. <div class="bookquote">``Dan, you're a white man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said
Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``I'll keep it as long as I live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good hearin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, with a pleasant laugh; and then,
anxious to change the subject: <div class="bookquote">``Look's if your line was fast to
somethin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fouled, I guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harve</b></font>)</div>said Harve, tugging. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) pulled up he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) fastened
the belt round him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>), and with deep delight heard the tip of the sheath
click on the thwart. <div class="bookquote">``Concern the thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tai</b></font>) acts as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tai</b></font>) were on strawberry-bottom. It's all sand here, ain't it'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan reached over and gave a judgmatic tweak. ``Holibut'll act that way
'f he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s sulky. Thet's no strawberry-bottom. Yank her (<font color='blue'><b>Tai</b></font>) once or twice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tai</b></font>)
gives, sure. <div class="bookquote">``Guess we'd better haul up an' make certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They pulled together, making fast at each turn on the cleats, and the
hidden weight rose sluggishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prize, oh! Haul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>shouted Dan, but the shout ended in a shrill, double
shriek of horror, for out of the sea came--the body of the dead
Frenchman buried two days before! The hook had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) under the
right armpit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) swayed, erect and horrible, head and shoulders
above water. His (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) arms were tied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) side, and--he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) had no face. The
boys fell over each other in a heap at the bottom of the dory, and
there they lay while the thing bobbed alongside, held on the shortened
line.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The tide--the tide brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, with quivering lips, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) fumbled at the clasp of the belt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lord! Oh, Harve!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>groaned Dan, <div class="bookquote">``be quick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s come for it. Let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) have it. Take it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it! I don't want it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>cried Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``I can't find the
bu-buckle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick, Harve! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s on your line!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey sat up to unfasten the belt, facing the head that had no face
under its streaming hair. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s fast still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) whispered to Dan, who
slipped out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) knife and cut the line, as Harvey flung the belt far
overside. The body shot down with a plop, and Dan cautiously rose to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) knees, whiter than the fog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) come for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) come for it. I've seen a stale one hauled up on a
trawl and I didn't much care, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) come to us special.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish--I wish I hadn't taken the knife. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'d have come on your

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dunno as thet would ha' made any differ. We're both scared out o' ten
years' growth. Oh, Harve, did ye see his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I'? I'll never forget it. But look at here, Dan; it couldn't have
been meant. It was only the tide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tide! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) come for it, Harve. Why, they sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) six mile to south`ard
o' the Fleet, an' we're two miles from where she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>)'s lyin' now. They told
me he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was weighted with a fathom an' a half o' chain-cable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) did with the knife--up on the French coast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Something bad. <div class="bookquote">``Guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)'s bound to take it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) to the Judgment,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaving 'em overboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for? We sha'n't eat 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care. I had to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) face while I was takin' the belt
off. You can keep your catch if you like. I've no use for mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan said nothing, but threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) fish over again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Guess it's best to be on the safe side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) murmured at last. <div class="bookquote">``I'd
give a month's pay if this fog `u'd lift. Things go abaout in a fog
that ye don't see in clear weather--yo-hoes an' hollerers and such
like. I'm sorter relieved he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) come the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) did instid o' walkin'. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
might ha' walked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Do-on`t, Dan! We're right on top of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) now. <div class="bookquote">``Wish I was safe aboard,
bein' pounded by Uncle Salters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll be lookin' fer us in a little. Gimme the tooter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan took the
tin dinner-horn, but paused before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) blew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to stay here all night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Question is, haow he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)'d take it. There was a man frum down the coast
told me once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in a schooner where they darsen't ever blow a horn
to the dories, becaze the skipper--not the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was with, but a
captain that had run her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) five years before--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d drownded a boy
alongside in a drunk fit; an' ever after, that boy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d row alongside
too and shout, ``Dory! dory!<div class="bookquote">'' with the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dory! dory!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a muffled voice cried through the fog. They cowered
again, and the horn dropped from Dan's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>cried Harvey; <div class="bookquote">``it's the cook.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dunno what made me think o' thet fool tale, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``It's
the doctor, sure enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dan! Danny! Oooh, Dan! Harve! Harvey! Oooh, Haarveee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're here,''  (<font color='red'><b>both boys</b></font>)</div>sung both boys together. They heard oars, but could see
nothing till the cook, shining and dripping, rowed into them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What iss happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You will be beaten at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thet's what we want. Thet's what we're sufferin' for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan.
<div class="bookquote">``Anything homey's good enough fer us. We've had kinder depressin'
company.''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>As the cook passed them a line, Dan told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) the tale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yess! He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) come for hiss knife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) said at the end.

<p/>Never had the little rocking <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>looked so deliciously
home--like as when the cook, born and bred in fogs, rowed them back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>). There was a warm glow of light from the cabin and a satisfying
smell of food forward, and it was heavenly to hear Disko and the
others, all quite alive and solid, leaning over the rail and promising
them a first-class pounding. But the cook was a black master of
strategy. He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) did not get the dories aboard till he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had given the more
striking points of the tale, explaining as he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) backed and bumped round
the counter how Harvey was the mascot to destroy any possible bad luck.
So the boys came overside as rather uncanny heroes, and every one asked
them questions instead of pounding them for making trouble. Little Penn
delivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions; but public
opinion was against him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) and in favour of Long Jack, who told the most
excruciating ghost-stories to nearly midnight. Under that influence no
one except Salters and Penn said anything about <div class="bookquote">``idolatry''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>when the
cook put a lighted candle, a cake of flour and water, and a pinch of
salt on a shingle, and floated them out astern to keep the Frenchman
quiet in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) was still restless. Dan lit the candle because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) had
bought the belt, and the cook grunted and muttered charms as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
could see the ducking point of flame.

<p/>Said Harvey to Dan, as they turned in after watch: <div class="bookquote">``How about progress
and Catholic superstitions?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Huh! I guess I'm as enlightened and progressive as the next man, but
when it comes to a dead St. Malo deck-hand scarin' a couple o' pore
boys stiff fer the sake of a thirty-cent knife, why, then, the cook can
take hold fer all o' me. I mistrust furriners, livin' or dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div><p/>Next morning all, except the cook, were rather ashamed of the
ceremonies, and went to work double tides, speaking gruffly to one
another.

<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was racing neck and neck for her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) last few loads
against the <div class="bookquote">``Parry Norman'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; and so close was the struggle that the
Fleet took sides and betted tobacco. All hands worked at the lines or
dressing-down till they fell asleep where they stood--beginning before
dawn and ending when it was too dark to see. They even used the cook as
pitcher, and turned Harvey into the hold to pass salt, while Dan helped
to dress down. Luckily a <div class="bookquote">``Parry Norman''  (<font color='red'><b>a Parry Norman man</b></font>)</div>man sprained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ankle falling
down the fo`c`sle, and the <div class="bookquote">``We're Heres''  (<font color='red'><b>a Parry Norman man</b></font>)</div>gained. Harvey could not see
how one more fish could be crammed into her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but Disko and Tom Platt
stowed and stowed, and planked the mass down with big stones from the
ballast, and there was always <div class="bookquote">``jest another day's work.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>Disko did not
tell them when all the salt was wetted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) rolled to the lazarette aft
the cabin and began hauling out the big mainsail. This was at ten in
the morning. The riding-sail was down and the main- and top-sail were
up by noon, and dories came alongside with letters for home, envying
their good fortune. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cleared decks, hoisted her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flag,--as is
the right of the first boat off the Banks,--up-anchored, and began to
move. Disko pretended that he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) wished to accommodate folk who had not
sent in their mail, and so worked her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gracefully in and out among the
schooners. In reality, that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) little triumphant procession, and
for the fifth year running it showed what kind of mariner he (<font color='blue'><b>Platt</b></font>) was. Dan's
accordion and Tom Platt's fiddle supplied the music of the magic verse
you must not sing till all the salt is wet:

<p/>``Hih! Yih! Yoho!
Send your letters raound!
All our salt is wetted, an' the anchor's off the graound!
Bend, oh, bend your mains`l!, we're back to Yankeeland--
With fifteen hunder' quintal,
An' fifteen hunder' quintal,
``Teen hunder' toppin' quintal,
``Twix' old <div class="bookquote">``Queereau an' Grand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Teen</b></font>)</div><p/>The last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal, and the
Gloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolk and
owners, while the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>owners</b></font>)</div>finished the musical ride through the
Fleet, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head-sails quivering like a man's hand when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raises it to
say good-bye.

<p/>Harvey very soon discovered that the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'' (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>, with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
riding-sail, strolling from berth to berth, and the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>headed
west by south under home canvas, were two very different boats. There
was a bite and kick to the wheel even in <div class="bookquote">``boy's''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>weather; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) could feel
the dead weight in the hold flung forward mightily across the surges,
and the streaming line of bubbles overside made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) eyes dizzy.

<p/>Disko kept them busy fiddling with the sails; and when those were
flattened like a racing yacht's, Dan had to wait on the big topsail,
which was put over by hand every time she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) went about. In spare moments
they pumped, for the packed fish dripped brine, which does not improve
a cargo. But since there was no fishing, Harvey had time to look at the
sea from another point of view. The low-sided schooner was naturally on
most intimate terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) surroundings. They saw little of the
horizon save when she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) topped a swell; and usually she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was elbowing,
fidgeting, and coaxing her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) steadfast way through grey, grey-blue, or
black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam;
or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger
water-hill. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said: ``You wouldn't hurt me, surely? I'm
only the little <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would slide away chuckling
softly to herself till she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was brought up by some fresh obstacle. The
dullest of folk cannot see this kind of thing hour after hour through
long days without noticing it; and Harvey, being anything but dull,
began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wave-tops turning over
with a sound of incessant tearing; the hurry of the winds working
across open spaces and herding the purple-blue cloud-shadows; the
splendid upheaval of the red sunrise; the folding and packing away of
the morning mists, wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors;
the salty glare and blaze of noon; the kiss of rain falling over
thousands of dead, flat square miles; the chilly blackening of
everything at the day's end; and the million wrinkles of the sea under
the moonlight, when the jib-boom solemnly poked at the low stars, and
Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook.

<p/>But the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together, Tom
Platt within hail, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) cuddled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lee-rail down to the crashing
blue, and kept a little home-made rainbow arching unbroken over her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
windlass. Then the jaws of the booms whined against the masts, and the
sheets creaked, and the sails filled with roaring; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) slid
into a hollow she (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) trampled like a woman tripped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) own silk dress,
and came out, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) jib wet half-way up, yearning and peering for the
tall twin-lights of Thatcher's Island.

<p/>They left the cold grey of the Bank sea, saw the lumber-ships making
for Quebec by the Straits of St. Lawrence, with the Jersey salt-brigs
from Spain and Sicily; found a friendly northeaster off Artimon Bank
that drove them within view of the East light of Sable Island,--a sight
Disko did not linger over,--and stayed with them past Western and Le
Have, to the northern fringe of George's. From there they picked up the
deeper water, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Disko</b></font>) go merrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hattie's pulling on the string,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan confided to Harvey. ``Hattie an'
ma. Next Sunday you'll be hirin' a boy to throw water on the windows to
make ye go to sleep. <div class="bookquote">``Guess you'll keep with us till your folks come.
Do you know the best of gettin' ashore again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hot bath'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) eyebrows were all white with dried spray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good, but a night-shirt's better. I've been dreamin' o'
night-shirts ever since we bent our mainsail. Ye can wiggle your toes
then. Ma'll hev a new one fer me, all washed soft. It's home, Harve.
It's home! Ye can sense it in the air. We're runnin' into the aidge of
a hot wave naow, an' I can smell the bayberries. Wonder if we'll get in
fer supper. Port a trifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep
smoothed out, blue and oily, round them. When they whistled for a wind
only the rain came in spiky rods, bubbling and drumming, and behind the
rain the thunder and the lightning of mid-August. They lay on the deck
with bare feet and arms, telling one another what they would order at
their first meal ashore; for now the land was in plain sight. A
Gloucester swordfish-boat drifted alongside, a man in the little pulpit
on the bowsprit flourishing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) harpoon, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bare head plastered down
with the wet. <div class="bookquote">``And all's well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sang cheerily, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were
watch on a big liner. <div class="bookquote">``Wouverman's waiting fer you, Disko. What's the
news o' the Fleet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko shouted it and passed on, while the wild summer storm pounded
overhead and the lightning flickered along the capes from four
different quarters at once. It gave the low circle of hills round
Gloucester Harbour, Ten Pound Island, the fish-sheds, with the broken
line of house-roofs, and each spar and buoy on the water, in blinding
photographs that came and went a dozen times to the minute as the
<div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div>crawled in on half-flood, and the whistling-buoy moaned
and mourned behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Pound</b></font>). Then the storm died out in long, separated,
vicious dags of blue-white flame, followed by a single roar like the
roar of a mortar-battery, and the shaken air tingled under the stars as
it got back to silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The flag, the flag!''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, suddenly, pointing upward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is ut?''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Otto! Ha'af mast. They can see us frum shore now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd clean forgot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>)'s no folk to Gloucester, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>) was goin' to be married to this fall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, and lowered the little flag half-mast
for the sake of Otto, swept overboard in a gale off Le Have three
months before.

<p/>Disko wiped the wet from his (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) eyes and led the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>to
Wouverman's wharf, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) orders in whispers, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>) swung round
moored tugs and night-watchmen hailed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wouverman</b></font>) from the ends of inky-black
piers. Over and above the darkness and the mystery of the procession,
Harvey could feel the land close round him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) once more, with all its
thousands of people asleep, and the smell of earth after rain, and the
familiar noise of a switching-engine coughing to herself in a
freight-yard; and all those things made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) heart beat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) throat
dry up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) stood by the foresheet. They heard the anchor-watch
snoring on a lighthouse-tug, nosed into a pocket of darkness where a
lantern glimmered on either side; somebody waked with a grunt, threw
them a rope, and they made fast to a silent wharf flanked with great
iron-roofed sheds full of warm emptiness, and lay there without a sound.

<p/>Then Harvey sat down by the wheel, and sobbed and sobbed as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
heart would break, and a tall woman who had been sitting on a
weigh-scale dropped down into the schooner and kissed Dan once on the
cheek; for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>by the
lightning-flashes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took no notice of Harvey till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had recovered
himself a little and Disko had told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) story. Then they went to
Disko's house together as the dawn was breaking; and until the
telegraph office was open and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) could wire to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) folk, Harvey Cheyne
was perhaps the loneliest boy in all America. But the curious thing was
that Disko and Dan seemed to think none the worse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) for crying.

<p/>Wouverman was not ready for Disko's prices till Disko, sure that the
<div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>was at least a week ahead of any other Gloucester boat,
had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) a few days to swallow them; so all hands played about the
streets, and Long Jack stopped the Rocky Neck trolley, on principle, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, till the conductor let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ride free. But Dan went about with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) freckled nose in the air, bungful of mystery and most haughty to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dan, I'll hev to lay inter you ef you act this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troop,
pensively. <div class="bookquote">``Sence we've come ashore this time you've bin a heap too
fresh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd lay into him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) naow ef he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Salters, sourly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)
and Penn boarded with the Troops.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, shuffling with the accordion round the back-yard,
ready to leap the fence if the enemy advanced. ``Dad, you're welcome to
your own jedgment, but remember I've warned ye. Your own flesh an'
blood ha' warned ye! <div class="bookquote">``Tain't any o' my fault ef you're mistook, but
I'll be on deck to watch ye. An' ez fer yeou, Uncle Salters, Pharaoh's
chief butler ain't in it `longside o' you! You watch aout an' wait.
You'll be ploughed under like your own blamed clover; but me--Dan
Troop--I'll flourish like a green bay-tree because I warn't stuck on my
own opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko was smoking in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) shore dignity and a pair of beautiful
carpet-slippers. <div class="bookquote">``You're gettin' ez crazy as poor Harve. You two go
araound gigglin' an' squinchin' an' kickin' each other under the table
till there's no peace in the haouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's goin' to be a heap less--fer some folks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan replied. <div class="bookquote">``You
wait an' see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) and Harvey went out on the trolley to East Gloucester, where they
tramped through the bayberry-bushes to the lighthouse, and lay down on
the big red boulders and laughed themselves hungry. Harvey had shown
Dan a telegram, and the two swore to keep silence till the shell burst.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harve's folk?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, with an unruffled face after supper. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I
guess they don't amount to much of anything, or we'd ha' heard frum 'em
by naow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harve</b></font>) pop keeps a kind o' store out West. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Harve</b></font>)'ll give you's
much as five dollars, dad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I tell ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Salters. <div class="bookquote">``Don't sputter over your vittles,
Dan.''



 (<font color='red'><b>a multimillionaire</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>Whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) private sorrows may be, a multimillionaire, like any other
workingman, should keep abreast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) business. Harvey Cheyne, senior,
had gone East late in June to meet a woman broken down, half mad, who
dreamed day and night of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son drowning in the grey seas. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had
surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with doctors, trained nurses, massage-women, and even
faith-cure companions, but they were useless. Mrs. Cheyne lay still and
moaned, or talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) boy by the hour together to any one who would
listen. Hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) had none, and who could offer it? All she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) needed was
assurance that drowning did not hurt; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) husband watched to guard
lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) should make the experiment. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own sorrow he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke
little--hardly realised the depth of it till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) caught himself asking
the calendar on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) writing-desk, <div class="bookquote">``What's the use of going on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There had always lain a pleasant notion at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head that,
some day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had rounded off everything and the boy had left
college, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would take his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) son to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart and lead him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
possessions. Then that boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) argued, as busy fathers do, would
instantly become his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) companion, partner, and ally, and there would
follow splendid years of great works carried out together--the old head
backing the young fire. Now his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) boy was dead--lost at sea, as it might
have been a Swede sailor from one of Cheyne's big tea-ships; the wife
was dying, or worse; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) himself was trodden down by platoons of women
and doctors and maids and attendants; worried almost beyond endurance
by the shift and change of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) poor restless whims; hopeless, with no
heart to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) many enemies.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) had taken the wife to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) raw new palace in San Diego, where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) people occupied a wing of great price, and Cheyne, in a
verandah-room, between a secretary and a typewriter, who was also a
telegraphist, toiled along wearily from day to day. There was a war of
rates among four Western railroads in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) was supposed to be
interested; a devastating strike had developed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) lumber-camps in
Oregon, and the legislature of the State of California, which has no
love for its makers, was preparing open war against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>).

<p/>Ordinarily he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) would have accepted battle ere it was offered, and have
waged a pleasant and unscrupulous campaign. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) sat limply, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)
soft black hat pushed forward on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) nose, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) big body shrunk
inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) loose clothes, staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) boots or the Chinese junks in
the bay, and assenting absently to the secretary's questions as he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>)
opened the Saturday mail.

<p/>Cheyne was wondering how much it would cost to drop everything and pull
out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) carried huge insurances, could buy himself royal annuities, and
between one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) places in Colorado and a little society -LRB-that would
do the wife good-RRB-, say in Washington and the South Carolina islands, a
man might forget plans that had come to nothing. On the other hand...

<p/>The click of the typewriter stopped; the girl was looking at the
secretary, who had turned white.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) passed Cheyne a telegram repeated from San Francisco:

<p/>Picked up by fishing schooner <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>San Francisco</b></font>)</div>having fallen off boat great
times on Banks fishing all well waiting Gloucester Mass care Disko
Troop for money or orders wire what shall do and how is mama Harvey N.
Cheyne.

<p/>The father let it fall, laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) head down on the roller-top of the
shut desk, and breathed heavily. The secretary ran for Mrs. Cheyne's
doctor, who found Cheyne pacing to and fro.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What-what d'you think of it? Is it possible? Is there any meaning to
it? I can't quite make it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``I lose seven thousand a year--that's all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) thought of the struggling New York practice he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) had dropped at
Cheyne's imperious bidding, and returned the telegram with a sigh.

<p/>``You mean you'd tell her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``Maybe a fraud?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the motive?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Detection's too certain.
It's the boy sure enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a maid</b></font>)</div><p/>Enter a French maid, impudently, as an indispensable one who is kept on
only by large wages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Cheyne she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) say you must come at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) think you are seek.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The master</b></font>)</div><p/>The master of thirty millions bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head meekly and followed
Suzanne; and a thin, high voice on the upper landing of the great
white-wood square staircase cried: <div class="bookquote">``What is it? what has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Suzanne</b></font>)</div><p/>No doors could keep out the shriek that rang through the echoing house
a moment later, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Suzanne</b></font>) husband blurted out the news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, serenely, to the typewriter.
<div class="bookquote">``About the only medical statement in novels with any truth to it is
that joy don't kill, Miss Kinzey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it; but we've a heap to do first.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kinzey</b></font>)</div>Miss Kinzey was from
Milwaukee, somewhat direct of speech; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Kinzey</b></font>) fancy leaned towards
the secretary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kinzey</b></font>) divined there was work in hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) was looking
earnestly at the vast roller-map of America on the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Milsom, we're going right across. Private car straight
through--Boston. Fix the connections,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>shouted Cheyne down the
staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The secretary</b></font>)</div><p/>The secretary turned to the typewriter, and their eyes met -LRB-out of that
was born a story--nothing to do with this story-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kinzey</b></font>) looked
inquiringly, doubtful of his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) resources. He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) signed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kinzey</b></font>) to move to the
Morse as a general brings brigades into action. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morse</b></font>) swept his (<font color='blue'><b>Morse</b></font>) hand.
musician-wise through his (<font color='blue'><b>Morse</b></font>) hair, regarded the ceiling, and set to work,
while Miss Kinzey's white fingers called up the Continent of America.

<p/>``K. H. Wade, Los Angeles--The <div class="bookquote">``Constance' is at Los Angeles, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Kinzey</b></font>),
Miss Kinzey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yep.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kinzey</b></font>)</div>Miss Kinzey nodded between clicks as the secretary looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>)
watch.

<p/>``Ready? Send ``Constance,<div class="bookquote">'' private car, here, and arrange for special to
leave here Sunday in time to connect with New York Limited at Sixteenth
Street, Chicago, Tuesday next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Constance</b></font>)</div><p/>Click--click--click! <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you better that'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Not on those grades. That gives 'em sixty hours from here to Chicago.
They won't gain anything by taking a special east of that. Ready? Also
arrange with Lake Shore and Michigan Southern to take <div class="bookquote">``Constance' on
New York Central and Hudson River Buffalo to Albany, and B. and A. the
same Albany to Boston. Indispensable I should reach Boston Wednesday
evening. Be sure nothing prevents. Have also wired Canniff, Toucey, and
Barnes.--Sign, Cheyne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kinzey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Kinzey nodded, and the secretary went on.

<p/>``Now then. Canniff, Toucey, and Barnes, of course. Ready? Canniff
Chicago. Please take my private car <div class="bookquote">``Constance `from Santa Fe at
Sixteenth Street next Tuesday p. m. on N. Y. Limited through to Buffalo
and deliver N. Y. C. for Albany.--Ever bin to N' York, Miss Kinzey?
We'll go some day. Ready? Take car Buffalo to Albany on Limited Tuesday
p. m. That's for Toucey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't bin to Noo York, but I know that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a toss of the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beg pardon. Now, Boston and Albany, Barnes, same instructions from
Albany through to Boston. Leave three-five P. M. -LRB-you needn't wire
that-RRB-; arrive nine-five P. M. Wednesday. That covers everything Wade
will do, but it pays to shake up the managers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's great,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kinzey</b></font>)</div>said Miss Kinzey, with a look of admiration. This was the
kind of man she (<font color='blue'><b>Kinzey</b></font>) understood and appreciated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tisn't bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Milsom, modestly. <div class="bookquote">``Now, any one but me would have
lost thirty hours and spent a week working out the run, instead of
handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wade</b></font>) over to the Santa Fe straight through to Chicago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But see here, about that Noo York Limited. Chauncey Depew himself
couldn't hitch his (<font color='blue'><b>Chauncey</b></font>) car to her (<font color='blue'><b>M.</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kinzey</b></font>)</div>Miss Kinzey suggested, recovering
herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but this isn't Chauncey. It's Cheyne--lightning. It goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even so. Guess we'd better wire the boy. You've forgotten that,
anyhow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned with the father's message bidding Harvey meet them in
Boston at an appointed hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) found Miss Kinzey laughing over the
keys. Then Milsom laughed too, for the frantic clicks from Los Angeles
ran: <div class="bookquote">``We want to know why--why--why? General uneasiness developed and
spreading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Milsom</b></font>)</div><p/>Ten minutes later Chicago appealed to Miss Kinzey in these words: <div class="bookquote">``If
crime of century is maturing please warn friends in time. We are all
getting to cover here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kinzey</b></font>)</div><p/>This was capped by a message from Topeka -LRB-and wherein Topeka was
concerned even Milsom could not guess-RRB-: <div class="bookquote">``Don't shoot, Colonel. We'll
come down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) enemies when the
telegrams were laid before him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They think we're on the war-path. Tell
'em we don't feel like fighting just now, Milsom. Tell 'em what we're
going for. I guess you and Miss Kinzey had better come along, though it
isn't likely I shall do any business on the road. Tell 'em the
truth--for once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So the truth was told. Miss Kinzey clicked in the sentiment while the
secretary added the memorable quotation, <div class="bookquote">``Let us have peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>the secretary</b></font>)</div>and in
board-rooms two thousand miles away the representatives of sixty-three
million dollars' worth of variously manipulated railroad interests
breathed more freely. Cheyne was flying to meet the only son, so
miraculously restored to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>). The bear was seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) cub, not the
bulls. Hard men who had their knives drawn to fight for their financial
lives put away the weapons and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) God-speed, while half a dozen
panic-smitten tin-pot roads perked up their heads and spoke of the
wonderful things they would have done had not Cheyne buried the hatchet.

<p/>It was a busy week-end among the wires; for, now that their anxiety was
removed, men and cities hastened to accommodate. Los Angeles called to
San Diego and Barstow that the Southern California engineers might know
and be ready in their lonely round-houses; Barstow passed the word to
the Atlantic and Pacific; the Albuquerque flung it the whole length of
the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe management, even into Chicago. An
engine, combination-car with crew, and the great and gilded <div class="bookquote">``Constance''
 (<font color='red'><b>crew</b></font>)</div>private car were to be <div class="bookquote">``expedited''  (<font color='red'><b>crew</b></font>)</div>over those two thousand three
hundred and fifty miles. The train would take precedence of one hundred
and seventy-seven others meeting and passing; despatches and crews of
every one of those said trains must be notified. Sixteen locomotives,
sixteen engineers, and sixteen firemen would be needed--each and every
one the best available. Two and one half minutes would be allowed for
changing engines, three for watering, and two for coaling. <div class="bookquote">``Warn the
men, and arrange tanks and chutes accordingly; for Harvey Cheyne is in
a hurry, a hurry-a hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sang the wires. <div class="bookquote">``Forty miles an hour will be
expected, and division superintendents will accompany this special over
their respective divisions. From San Diego to Sixteenth Street,
Chicago, let the magic carpet be laid down. Hurry! oh, hurry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be hot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne, as they rolled out of San Diego in the
dawn of Sunday. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to hurry, mama, just as fast as ever we
can; but I really don't think there's any good of your putting on your
bonnet and gloves yet. You'd much better lie down and take your
medicine. I'd play you a game o' dominoes, but it's Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be good. Oh, I will be good. Only--taking off my bonnet makes me
feel as if we'd never get there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try to sleep a little, mama, and we'll be in Chicago before you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's Boston, father. Tell them to hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The drivers</b></font>)</div><p/>The six-foot drivers were hammering their way to San Bernardino and the
Mohave wastes, but this was no grade for speed. That would come later.
The heat of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned
east to the Needles and the Colorado River. The car cracked in the
utter drought and glare, and they put crushed ice to Mrs. Cheyne's
neck, and toiled up the long, long grades, past Ash Fork, towards
Flagstaff, where the forests and quarries are, under the dry, remote
skies. The needle of the speed-indicator flicked and wagged to and fro;
the cinders rattled on the roof, and a whirl of dust sucked after the
whirling wheels, The crew of the combination sat on their bunks,
panting in their shirt-sleeves, and Cheyne found himself among them
shouting old, old stories of the railroad that every trainman knows,
above the roar of the car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) told them about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) son, and how the sea
had given up its dead, and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>);
asked after <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>), back there,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) could stand it if the
engineer <div class="bookquote">``let her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) out a piece,''  (<font color='red'><b>the engineer</b></font>)</div>and Cheyne thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) could.
Accordingly, the great fire-horse was <div class="bookquote">``let out''  (<font color='red'><b>Winslow</b></font>)</div>from Flagstaff to
Winslow, till a division superintendent protested.

<p/>But Mrs. Cheyne, in the boudoir state-room, where the French maid,
sallow-white with fear, clung to the silver door-handle, only moaned a
little and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) husband to bid them <div class="bookquote">``hurry.''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>And so they dropped
the dry sands and moon-struck rocks of Arizona behind them, and grilled
on till the crash of the couplings and the wheeze of the brake-hose
told them they were at Coolidge by the Continental Divide. Three bold
and experienced men--cool, confident, and dry when they began; white,
quivering, and wet when they finished their trick at those terrible
wheels--swung her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) over the great lift from Albuquerque to Glorietta and
beyond Springer, up and up to the Raton Tunnel on the State line,
whence they dropped rocking into La Junta, had sight of the Arkansaw,
and tore down the long slope to Dodge City, where Cheyne took comfort
once again from setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) watch an hour ahead.

<p/>There was very little talk in the car. The secretary and typewriter sat
together on the stamped Spanish-leather cushions by the plate-glass
observation-window at the rear end, watching the surge and ripple of
the ties crowded back behind them, and, it is believed, making notes of
the scenery. Cheyne moved nervously between his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) own extravagant
gorgeousness and the naked necessity of the combination, an unlit cigar
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) teeth, till the pitying crews forgot that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) was their tribal
enemy, and did their best to entertain him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>).

<p/>At night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all
the luxuries, and they fared sumptuously, swinging on through the
emptiness of abject desolation. Now they heard the swish of a
water-tank, and the guttural voice of a China-man, the clink-clink of
hammers that tested the Krupp steel wheels, and the oath of a tramp
chased off the rear platform; now the solid crash of coal shot into the
tender; and now a beating back of noises as they flew past a waiting
train. Now they looked out into great abysses, a trestle purring
beneath their tread, or up to rocks that barred out half the stars. Now
scaur and ravine changed and rolled back to jagged mountains on the
horizon's edge, and now broke into hills lower and lower, till at last
came the true plains.

<p/>At Dodge City an unknown hand threw in a copy of a Kansas paper
containing some sort of an interview with Harvey, who had evidently
fallen in with an enterprising reporter, telegraphed on from Boston.
The joyful journalese revealed that it was beyond question their boy,
and it soothed Mrs. Cheyne for a while. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) one word <div class="bookquote">``hurry''  (<font color='red'><b>the crews</b></font>)</div>was
conveyed by the crews to the engineers at Nickerson, Topeka, and
Marceline, where the grades are easy, and they brushed the Continent
behind them. Towns and villages were close together now, and a man
could feel here that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved among people.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see the dial, and my eyes ache so. What are we doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very best we can, mama. There's no sense in getting in before the
Limited. We'd only have to wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care. I want to feel we're moving. Sit down and tell me the
miles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheyne sat down and read the dial for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) -LRB-there were some miles which
stand for records to this day-RRB-, but the seventy-foot car never changed
its long, steamer-like roll, moving through the heat with the hum of a
giant bee. Yet the speed was not enough for Mrs. Cheyne; and the heat,
the remorseless August heat, was making her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) giddy; the clock-hands
would not move, and when, oh, when would they be in Chicago?

<p/>It is not true that, as they changed engines at Fort Madison, Cheyne
passed over to the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers an
endowment sufficient to enable them to fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) fellows on
equal terms for evermore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) obligations to engineers and
firemen as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) believed they deserved, and only his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) bank knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)
gave the crews who had sympathised with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>). It is on record that the
last crew took entire charge of switching operations at Sixteenth
Street, because <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>the crew</b></font>)</div>was in a doze at last, and Heaven was to help any
one who bumped her (<font color='blue'><b>crews</b></font>).

<p/>Now the highly paid specialist who conveys the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern Limited from Chicago to Elkhart is something of an autocrat,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>autocrat</b></font>) does not approve of being told how to back up to a car. None the
less he (<font color='blue'><b>autocrat</b></font>) handled the <div class="bookquote">``Constance''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as if she (<font color='blue'><b>crews</b></font>) might have been a load of
dynamite, and when the crew rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>autocrat</b></font>), they did it in whispers and
dumb show.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>Atchison</b></font>)</div>said the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe men, discussing life
later, ``we weren't runnin' for a record. Harvey Cheyne's wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were
sick back, an' we didn't want to jounce her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come to think of it, our
runnin' time from San Diego to Chicago was 57.54. You can tell that to
them Eastern way-trains. When we're tryin' for a record, we'll let you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>To the Western man -LRB-though this would not please either city-RRB- Chicago
and Boston are cheek by jowl, and some railroads encourage the
delusion. The Limited whirled the <div class="bookquote">``Constance''  (<font color='red'><b>magnates</b></font>)</div>into Buffalo and the arms
of the New York Central and Hudson River -LRB-illustrious magnates with
white whiskers and gold charms on their watch-chains boarded her (<font color='blue'><b>crews</b></font>) here
to talk a little business to Cheyne-RRB-, who slid her (<font color='blue'><b>crews</b></font>) gracefully into
Albany, where the Boston and Albany completed the run from tide-water
to tide-water--total time, eighty-seven hours and thirty-five minutes,
or three days, fifteen hours and one half. Harvey was waiting for them.

<p/>After violent emotion most people and all boys demand food. They
feasted the returned prodigal behind drawn curtains, cut off in their
great happiness, while the trains roared in and out around them. Harvey
ate, drank, and enlarged on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) adventures all in one breath, and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had a hand free his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) mother fondled it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) voice was thickened with
living in the open, salt air; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) palms were rough and hard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) wrists
dotted with the marks of gurry-sores; and a fine full flavour of
cod-fish hung round rubber boots and blue jersey.

<p/>The father, well used to judging men, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) keenly. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not
know what enduring harm the boy might have taken. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) caught
himself thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew very little whatever of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) son; but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
distinctly remembered an unsatisfied, dough-faced youth who took
delight in <div class="bookquote">``calling down the old man''  (<font color='red'><b>an youth</b></font>)</div>and reducing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother to
tears--such a person as adds to the gaiety of public rooms and hotel
piazzas, where the ingenuous young of the wealthy play with or revile
the bell-boys. But this well set-up fisher-youth did not wriggle,
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with eyes steady, clear, and unflinching, and spoke in a
tone distinctly, even startlingly, respectful. There was that in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
voice, too, which seemed to promise that the change might be permanent,
and that the new Harvey had come to stay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some one's been coercing him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>thought Cheyne. <div class="bookquote">``Now Constance would
never have allowed that. Don't see as Europe could have done it any
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why didn't you tell this man, Troop, who you were?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>the mother
repeated, when Harvey had expanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) story at least twice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Disko Troop, dear. The best man that ever walked a deck. I don't care
who the next is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to put you ashore? You know papa would have
made it up to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) ten times over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) thought I was crazy. I'm afraid I called him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) a thief
because I couldn't find the bills in my pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sailor found them by the flagstaff that--that night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cheyne</b></font>)</div>sobbed Mrs.
Cheyne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That explains it, then. I don't blame Troop any. I just said I
wouldn't work--on a Banker, too--and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) hit me on the nose,
and oh! I bled like a stuck hog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor darling! They must have abused you horribly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dunno quite. Well, after that, I saw a light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheyne slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) leg and chuckled. This was going to be a boy after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) own hungry heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) had never seen precisely that twinkle in
Harvey's eye before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the old man gave me ten and a half a month; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s paid me half now;
and I took hold with Dan and pitched right in. I can't do a man's work
yet. But I can handle a dory `most as well as Dan, and I don't get
rattled in a fog--much; and I can take my trick in light winds--that's
steering, dear--and I can `most bait up a trawl, and I know my ropes,
of course; and I can pitch fish till the cows come home, and I'm great
on old Josephus, and I'll show you how I can clear coffee with a piece
of fish-skin, and--I think I'll have another cup, please. Say, you've
no notion what a heap of work there is in ten and a half a month!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I began with eight and a half, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`That so? You never told me, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never asked, Harve. I'll tell you about it some day, if you care
to listen. Try a stuffed olive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Troop says the most interesting thing in the world is to find out how

partner. And there's Uncle Salters and his (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) manures, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) reads
Josephus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)'s sure I'm crazy yet. And there's poor little Penn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)
is crazy. You mustn't talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>) about Johnstown, because--And, oh,
you must know Tom Platt and Long Jack and Manuel. Manuel saved my life.
I'm sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)'s a Portugee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) can't talk much, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)'s an everlasting
musician. He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) found me struck adrift and drifting, and hauled me in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder your nervous system isn't completely wrecked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Cheyne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for, mama? I worked like a horse and I ate like a hog and I slept
like a dead man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>That was too much for Mrs. Cheyne, who began to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) visions of
a corpse rocking on the salty seas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) state-room, and
Harvey curled up beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father, explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) indebtedness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can depend upon me to do everything I can for the crowd, Harve.
They seem to be good men on your showing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Best in the Fleet, sir. Ask at Gloucester,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. ``But Disko
believes still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s cured me of being crazy. Dan's the only one I've
let on to about you, and our private cars and all the rest of it, and
I'm not quite sure Dan believes. I want to paralyse 'em to-morrow. Say,
can't they run the <div class="bookquote">``Constance' over to Gloucester? Mama don't look fit
to be moved, anyway, and we're bound to finish cleaning out by
to-morrow. Wouverman takes our fish. You see, we're first off the Banks
this season, and it's four twenty-five a quintal. We held out till he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)
paid it. They want it quick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean you'll have to work to-morrow, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told Troop I would. I'm on the scales. I've brought the tallies with
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father choke. <div class="bookquote">``There isn't but three--no--two ninety-four or
five quintal more by my reckoning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hire a substitute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>suggested Cheyne, to see what Harvey would say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't, sir. I'm tally-man for the schooner. Troop says I've a better
head for figures than Dan. Troop's a mighty just man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, suppose I don't move the <div class="bookquote">``Constance' to-night, how'll you fix
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey looked at the clock, which marked twenty past eleven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll sleep here till three and catch the four o'clock freight.
They let us men from the Fleet ride free, as a rule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That's a notion. But I think we can get the <div class="bookquote">``Constance' around about
as soon as your men's freight. Better go to bed now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey spread himself on the sofa, kicked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) boots, and was asleep
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father could shade the electrics. Cheyne sat watching the
young face under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead, and
among many things that occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) was the notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) might
perhaps have been neglectful as a father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One never knows when one's taking one's biggest risks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It
might have been worse than drowning; but I don't think it has--I don't
think it has. If it hasn't, I haven't enough to pay Troop, that's all;
and I don't think it has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Morning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows, the <div class="bookquote">``Constance''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>was side-tracked among freight-cars at Gloucester, and Harvey had gone
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>)'ll fall overboard again and be drowned,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>the mother said
bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll go and look, ready to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) a rope in case. You've never
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) working for his (<font color='blue'><b>Constance</b></font>) bread,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense! As if any one expected--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the man that hired him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s about right, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>fishermen</b></font>)</div><p/>They went down between the stores full of fishermen's oilskins to
Wouverman's wharf, where the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Wouverman</b></font>)</div>rode high, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Bank flag
still flying, all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light.
Disko stood by the main hatch superintending Manuel, Penn, and Uncle
Salters at the tackle. Dan was swinging the loaded baskets inboard as
Long Jack and Tom Platt filled them, and Harvey, with a notebook,
represented the skipper's interests before the clerk of the scales on
the salt-sprinkled wharf-edge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ready!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the voices below. <div class="bookquote">``Haul!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Disko. <div class="bookquote">``Hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>said
Manuel. <div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, swinging the basket. Then they heard Harvey's
voice, clear and fresh, checking the weights.

<p/>The last of the fish had been whipped out, and Harvey leaped from the
string-piece six feet to a ratline, as the shortest way to hand Disko
the tally, shouting, <div class="bookquote">``Two ninety-seven, and an empty hold!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's total, Harve?''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko.

<p/>``Eight sixty-five. Three thousand six hundred and seventy-six dollars
and a quarter. <div class="bookquote">``Wish I'd share as well as wage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't go so far as to say you hevn't deserved it, Harve. Don't
you want to slip up to Wouverman's office and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Harve</b></font>) our tallies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne to Dan, well used to all manner of
questions from those idle imbeciles called summer boarders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a kind o' supercargo,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer. <div class="bookquote">``We picked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up
struck adrift on the Banks. Fell overboard from a liner, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sez. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
a passenger. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s by way o' bein' a fisherman now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) worth his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) keep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-ep. Dad, this man wants to know ef Harve's worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) keep. Say,
would you like to go aboard? We'll fix a ladder for her (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I should very much, indeed. <div class="bookquote">``Twon't hurt you, mama, and you'll be able
to see for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman who could not lift her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head a week ago scrambled down the
ladder, and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be you anyways interested in Harve?''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, ye-es.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s a good boy, an' ketches right hold jest as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s bid. You've heard
haow we found him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) was sufferin' from nervous prostration, I guess,
'r else his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) head had hit somethin', when we hauled him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) aboard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s all
over that naow. Yes, this is the cabin. <div class="bookquote">``Tain't anyways in order, but
you're quite welcome to look around. Those are his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) figures on the
stove-pipe, where we keep the reckonin' mostly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) sleep here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cheyne, sitting on a yellow locker and
surveying the disorderly bunks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) berthed forward, madam, an' only fer him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) an' my boy hookin'
fried pies an' muggin' up when they ought to ha' been asleep, I dunno
as I've any special fault to find with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There weren't nothin' wrong with Harve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Salters,
descending the steps. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hung my boots on the main-truck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ain't
over an' above respectful to such as knows more'n he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) do, especially
about farmin'; but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were mostly misled by Dan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan, in the meantime, profiting by dark hints from Harvey early that
morning, was executing a war-dance on deck. <div class="bookquote">``Tom, Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) whispered
down the hatch. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) folks has come, an' dad hain't caught on yet, an'
they're pow-wowin' in the cabin. She (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s a daisy, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s all Harve
claimed he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) was, by the looks of him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Howly Smoke!''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, climbing out covered with salt and
fish-skin. <div class="bookquote">``D'ye belave his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) tale av the kid an' the little four-horse
rig was thrue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it all along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``Come an' see dad mistook in his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)
judgments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>They came delightedly, just in time to hear Cheyne say: <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)
has a good character, because--he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko's jaw fell,--Long Jack always vowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard the click of
it,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) stared alternately at the man and the woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) telegram in San Diego four days ago, and we came over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a private car?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) said ye might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a private car, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dan looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) father with a hurricane of irreverent winks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a tale he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) tould us av drivin' four little ponies in a rig av
his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack. <div class="bookquote">``Was that thrue now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne. <div class="bookquote">``Was it, mama?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) had a little drag when we were in Toledo, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother.

<p/>Long Jack whistled. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Disko!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), and that was all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wuz--I am mistook in my jedgments--worse'n the men o' Marblehead,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, as though the words were being windlassed out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
don't mind ownin' to you, Mister Cheyne, as I mistrusted the boy to be
crazy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) talked kinder odd about money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) tell ye anything else? <div class="bookquote">``Cause I pounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) once.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This with a
somewhat anxious glance at Mrs. Cheyne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Cheyne replied. <div class="bookquote">``I should say it probably did him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) more good
than anything else in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I jedged `twuz necessary, er I wouldn't ha' done it. I don't want you
to think we abuse our boys any on this packet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you do, Mr. Troop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Cheyne had been looking at the faces--Disko's ivory-yellow,
hairless, iron countenance; Uncle Salters's, with its rim of
agricultural hair; Penn's bewildered simplicity; Manuel's quiet smile;
Long Jack's grin of delight; and Tom Platt's scar. Rough, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)
standards, they certainly were; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) had a mother's wits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)
eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) rose with outstretched hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, tell me, which is who?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>), half sobbing. <div class="bookquote">``I want to thank
you and bless you--all of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, that pays me a hunder time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack.

<p/>Disko introduced them all in due form. The captain of an old-time
Chinaman could have done no better, and Mrs. Cheyne babbled
incoherently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) nearly threw herself into Manuel's arms when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)
understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) had first found Harvey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how shall I leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Troop</b></font>) dreeft?''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>said poor Manuel. <div class="bookquote">``What do you
yourself if you find him (<font color='blue'><b>Troop</b></font>) so? Eh, wha-at'? We are in one good boy, and I
am ever so pleased he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) come to be your son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told me Dan was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) partner!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) cried. Dan was already
sufficiently pink, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) turned a rich crimson when Mrs. Cheyne kissed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) on both cheeks before the assembly. Then they led her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) forward to
show her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) the fo`c`sle, at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) wept again, and must needs go down
to see Harvey's identical bunk, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) found the nigger cook
cleaning up the stove, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) nodded as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) were some one he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had
expected to meet for years. They tried, two at a time, to explain the
boat's daily life to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) sat by the pawl-post, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) gloved
hands on the greasy table, laughing with trembling lips and crying with
dancing eyes.

<p/>``And who's ever to use the ``We're Here<div class="bookquote">'' after this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack to
Tom Platt. <div class="bookquote">``I feel it as if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'d made a cathedral av ut all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cathedral!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Platt/Tom/Platt</b></font>)</div>sneered Tom Platt. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, ef it had bin even the Fish
C'mmission boat instid o' this bally-hoo o' blazes. Ef we only hed some
decency an' order an' side-boys when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) goes over! She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'ll have to
climb that ladder like a hen, an' we--we ought to be mannin' the yards!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Harvey was not mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Penn</b></font>)</div>said Penn, slowly, to Cheyne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed--thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the big millionaire replied, stooping down
tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be terrible to be mad. Except to lose your child, I do not
know anything more terrible. But your child has come back? Let us thank
God for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, looking down upon them benignly from the wharf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wuz mistook, Harve. I wuz mistook,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko, swiftly, holding up
a hand. <div class="bookquote">``I wuz mistook in my jedgments. Ye needn't rub it in any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Guess I'll take care o' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be goin' off naow, won't ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, not without the balance of my wages, `less you want to have the
``We're Here<div class="bookquote">'' attached.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thet's so; I'd clean forgot'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) counted out the remaining
dollars. <div class="bookquote">``You done all you contracted to do, Harve; and you done it
`baout's well as ef you'd been brought up--''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>Here Disko brought himself
up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) did not quite see where the sentence was going to end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Outside of a private car?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>suggested Dan, wickedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, and I'll show her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey.

<p/>Cheyne stayed to talk to Disko, but the others made a procession to the
depot, with Mrs. Cheyne at the head. The French maid shrieked at the
invasion; and Harvey laid the glories of the <div class="bookquote">``Constance''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>before them
without a word. They took them in in equal silence--stamped leather,
silver door-handles and rails, cut velvet, plate-glass, nickel, bronze,
hammered iron, and the rare woods of the Continent inlaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey; <div class="bookquote">``I told you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) crowning revenge,
and a most ample one.

<p/>Mrs. Cheyne decreed a meal; and that nothing might be lacking to the
tale Long Jack told afterwards in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) boarding-house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) waited on
them herself. Men who are accustomed to eat at tiny tables in howling
gales have curiously neat and finished table-manners; but Mrs. Cheyne,
who did not know this, was surprised. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) longed to have Manuel for a
butler; so silently and easily did he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) comport himself among the frail
glassware and dainty silver. Tom Platt remembered great days on the
Ohio and the manners of foreign potentates who dined with the officers;
and Long Jack, being Irish, supplied the small talk till all were at
their ease.

<p/>In the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here's''  (<font color='red'><b>the fathers</b></font>)</div>cabin the fathers took stock of each other behind
their cigars. Cheyne knew well enough when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) dealt with a man to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) could not offer money; equally well he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) knew that no money could pay
for what Disko had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) own counsel and waited for an
opening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hevn't done anything to your boy or fer your boy excep' make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
work a piece an' learn him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) how to handle the hog-yoke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
has twice my boy's head for figgers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Cheyne answered casually, <div class="bookquote">``what d'you calculate to make
of your boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Disko removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) cigar and waved it comprehensively round the cabin.
<div class="bookquote">``Dan's jest plain boy, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) don't allow me to do any of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thinkin'.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll hev this able little packet when I'm laid by. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ain't noways

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went over to Troop's eighteen-hundred-dollar, blue-trimmed white
house, with a retired dory full of nasturtiums in the front yard and a
shuttered parlor which was a museum of oversea plunder. There sat a
large woman, silent and grave, with the dim eyes of those who look long
to sea for the return of their beloved. Cheyne addressed himself to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave consent wearily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We lose one hundred a year from Gloucester only, Mr. Cheyne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said--<div class="bookquote">``one hundred boys an' men; and I've come so's to hate the sea as

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) jest despises the ocean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>Disko explained, <div class="bookquote">``an' I--I dunno haow to

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheyne was relieved when Dan turned up and accepted with more delight
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) was able to put into words. Indeed, the offer meant a plain and
sure road to all desirable things; but Dan thought most of commanding
watch on broad decks, and looking into far-away harbours.

<p/>Mrs. Cheyne had spoken privately to the unaccountable Manuel in the
matter of Harvey's rescue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) seemed to have no desire for money.
Pressed hard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) would take five dollars, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
wanted to buy something for a girl. Otherwise--<div class="bookquote">``How shall I take money
when I make so easy my eats and smokes? You will giva some if I like or
no? Eh, wha-at? Then you shall giva me money, but not that way. You
shall giva all you can think.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to a snuffy Portuguese
priest with a list of semi-destitute widows as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) cassock. As
a strict Unitarian, Mrs. Cheyne could not sympathise with the creed,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) ended by respecting the brown, voluble little man.

<p/>Manuel, faithful son of the Church, appropriated all the blessings
showered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) charity. <div class="bookquote">``That letta me out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have
now ver' good absolutions for six months'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) strolled forth to get
a handkerchief for the girl of the hour and to break the hearts of all
the others.

<p/>Salters went West for a season with Penn, and left no address behind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) had a dread that these millionary people, with wasteful private
cars, might take undue interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) companion. It was better to
visit inland relatives till the coast was clear. <div class="bookquote">``Never you be adopted
by rich folk, Penn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) said in the cars, <div class="bookquote">``or I'll take 'n' break this
checker-board over your head. Ef you forgit your name agin--which is

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>But it was otherwise with the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here's''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>silent cook, for he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) came
up, his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) kit in a handkerchief, and boarded the <div class="bookquote">``Constance.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Pay was no
particular object, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) did not in the least care where he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) slept. His (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
business, as revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) in dreams, was to follow Harvey for the
rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) days. They tried argument and, at last, persuasion; but
there is a difference between one Cape Breton and two Alabama negroes,
and the matter was referred to Cheyne by the cook and porter. The
millionaire only laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) presumed Harvey might need a body-servant
some day or other, and was sure that one volunteer was worth five
hirelings. Let the man stay, therefore; even though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called himself
MacDonald and swore in Gaelic. The car could go back to Boston, where,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were still of the same mind, they would take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) West.

<p/>With the <div class="bookquote">``Constance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart of hearts he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loathed, departed
the last remnant of Cheyne's millionairedom, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) gave himself up to
an energetic idleness. This Gloucester was a new town in a new land,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) purposed to <div class="bookquote">``take it in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as of old he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) had taken in all the
cities from Snohomish to San Diego of that world whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) hailed. They
made money along the crooked street which was half wharf and half
ship's store: as a leading professional he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) wished to learn how the
noble game was played. Men said that four out of every five fish-balls
served at New England's Sunday breakfast came from Gloucester, and
overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) with figures in proof--statistics of boats, gear,
wharf-frontage, capital invested, salting, packing, factories,
insurance, wages, repairs, and profits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) talked with the owners of
the large fleets whose skippers were little more than hired men, and
whose crews were almost all Swedes or Portuguese. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) conferred
with Disko, one of the few who owned their craft, and compared notes in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) vast head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) coiled himself away on chain-cables in marine
junk-shops, asking questions with cheerful, unslaked Western curiosity,
till all the water-front wanted to know <div class="bookquote">``what in thunder that man was
after, anyhow.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) prowled into the Mutual Insurance rooms, and
demanded explanations of the mysterious remarks chalked up on the
blackboard day by day; and that brought down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) secretaries of
every Fisherman's Widow and Orphan Aid Society within the city limits.
They begged shamelessly, each man anxious to beat the other
institution's record, and Cheyne tugged at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) beard and handed them
all over to Mrs. Cheyne.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) was resting in a boarding-house near Eastern Point--a strange
establishment, managed, apparently, by the boarders, where the
table-cloths were red-and-white-checkered, and the population, who
seemed to have known one another intimately for years, rose up at
midnight to make Welsh rare-bits if it felt hungry. On the second
morning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) stay Mrs. Cheyne put away her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) diamond solitaires before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) came down to breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're most delightful people,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) husband; <div class="bookquote">``so
friendly and simple, too, though they are all Boston, nearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That isn't simpleness, mama,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, looking across the boulders
behind the apple-trees where the hammocks were slung. <div class="bookquote">``It's the other
thing, that we--that I haven't got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cheyne, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``There isn't a woman here
owns a dress that cost a hundred dollars. Why, we--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it, dear. We have--of course we have. I guess it's only the
style they wear East. Are you having a good time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see very much of Harvey; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)'s always with you; but I ain't
near as nervous as I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I haven't had such a good time since Willie died. I never rightly
understood that I had a son before this. Harve's got to be a great boy.
``Anything I can fetch you, dear? <div class="bookquote">``Cushion under your head? Well, we'll
go down to the wharf again and look around.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father's shadow in those days, and the two strolled
along side by side, Cheyne using the grades as an excuse for laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>)
hand on the boy's square shoulder. It was then that Harvey noticed and
admired what had never struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) before--his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father's curious power of
getting at the heart of new matters as learned from men in the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How d'you make 'em tell you everything without opening your head?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>demanded the son, as they came out of a rigger's loft.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've dealt with quite a few men in my time, Harve, and one sizes 'em
up somehow, I guess. I know something about myself, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then, after a
pause, as they sat down on a wharf-edge: <div class="bookquote">``Men can `most always tell
when a man has handled things for himself, and then they treat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as
one of themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Same as they treat me down at Wouverman's wharf. I'm one of the crowd
now. Disko has told every one I've earned my pay.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey spread out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) hands and rubbed the palms together. <div class="bookquote">``They're all soft again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
said dolefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep 'em that way for the next few years, while you're getting your
education. You can harden 'em up after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es, I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply, in no delighted voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It rests with you, Harve. You can take cover behind your mama, of
course, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) on to fussing about your nerves and your
highstrungness and all that kind of poppycock.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I ever done that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, uneasily.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father turned where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) sat and thrust out a long hand. <div class="bookquote">``You know as
well as I do that I can't make anything of you if you don't act
straight by me. I can handle you alone if you'll stay alone, but I
don't pretend to manage both you and mama. Life's too short, anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't make me out much of a fellow, does it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess it was my fault a good deal; but if you want the truth, you
haven't been much of anything up to date. Now, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Umm! Disko thinks ... Say, what d'you reckon it's cost you to raise
me from the start--first, last, and all over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheyne smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I've never kept track, but I should estimate, in
dollars and cents, nearer fifty than forty thousand; maybe sixty. The
young generation comes high. It has to have things, and it tires of
'em, and--the old man foots the bill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey whistled, but at heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was rather pleased to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
upbringing had cost so much. <div class="bookquote">``And all that's sunk capital, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Invested, Harve. Invested, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Making it only thirty thousand, the thirty I've earned is about ten
cents on the hundred. That's a mighty poor catch.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
head solemnly.

<p/>Cheyne laughed till he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) nearly fell off the pile into the water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Disko has got a heap more than that out of Dan since he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was ten; and
Dan's at school half the year, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's what you're after, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I'm not after anything. I'm not stuck on myself any just
now--that's all ... I ought to be kicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't do it, old man; or I would, I presume, if I'd been made that
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'd have remembered it to the last day I lived--and never
forgiven you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) doubled fists.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. That's about what I'd do. You see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. The fault's with me and no one else. All the samey, something's
got to be done about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheyne drew a cigar from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) vest-pocket, bit off the end, and fell to
smoking. Father and son were very much alike; for the beard hid
Cheyne's mouth, and Harvey had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father's slightly aquiline nose,
close-set black eyes, and narrow, high cheek-bones. With a touch of
brown paint he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) would have made up very picturesquely as a Red Indian of
the story-books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you can go on from here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne, slowly, <div class="bookquote">``costing me between
six or eight thousand a year till you're a voter. Well, we'll call you
a man then. You can go right on from that, living on me to the tune of
forty or fifty thousand, besides what your mother will give you, with a
valet and a yacht or a fancy-ranch where you can pretend to raise
trotting stock and play cards with your own crowd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like Lorry Tuck?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey put in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yep; or the two De Vitré boys or old man McQuade's son. California's
full of 'em, and here's an Eastern sample while we're talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A shiny black steam-yacht, with mahogany deck-house, nickel-plated
binnacles, and pink-and-white-striped awnings, puffed up the harbour,
flying the burgee of some New York club. Two young men, in what they
conceived to be sea costumes, were playing cards by the saloon
skylight; and a couple of women with red and blue parasols looked on
and laughed noisily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't care to be caught out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tuck</b></font>) in any sort of a breeze. No,
beam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, critically, as the yacht slowed to pick up her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>)
mooring-buoy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're having what stands them for a good time. I can give you that,
and twice as much as that, Harve. How'd you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caesar! That's no way to get a dinghy over-side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey, still
intent on the yacht. <div class="bookquote">``If I couldn't slip a tackle better than that I'd
stay ashore... What if I don't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay ashore--or what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yacht and ranch and live on `the old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>mama</b></font>)</div>and--get behind mama when
there's trouble,'' said Harvey, with a twinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, in that case, you come right in with me, my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten dollars a month?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another twinkle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a cent more until you're worth it, and you won't begin to touch
that for a few years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner begin sweeping out the office--isn't that how the big bugs
start?--and touch something now than--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it; we all feel that way. But I guess we can hire any sweeping
we need. I made the same mistake myself of starting in too soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty million dollars' worth o' mistake, wasn't it? I'd risk it for
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I lost some; and I gained some. I'll tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Cheyne pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) beard and smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) looked over the still water,
and spoke away from Harvey, who presently began to be aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
father was telling the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) talked in a low, even
voice, without gesture and without expression; and it was a history for
which a dozen leading journals would cheerfully have paid many
dollars--the story of forty years that was at the same time the story
of the New West, whose story is yet to be written.

<p/>It began with a kinless boy turned loose in Texas, and went on
fantastically through a hundred changes and chops of life, the scenes
shifting from State after Western State, from cities that sprang up in
a month and in a season utterly withered away, to wild ventures in
wilder camps that are now laborious, paved municipalities. It covered
the building of three railroads and the deliberate wreck of a fourth.
It told of steamers, townships, forests, and mines, and the men of
every nation under heaven, manning, creating, hewing, and digging
these. It touched on chances of gigantic wealth flung before eyes that
could not see, or missed by the merest accident of time and travel; and
through the mad shift of things, sometimes on horseback, more often
afoot, now rich, now poor, in and out, and back and forth, deck-hand,
train-hand, contractor, boardinghouse keeper, journalist, engineer,
drummer, real-estate agent, politician, dead-beat, rumseller,
mine-owner, speculator, cattle-man, or tramp, moved Harvey Cheyne,
alert and quiet, seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) own ends, and, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) said, the glory and
advancement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) country.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) told of the faith that never deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) hung on the
ragged edge of despair the faith that comes of knowing men and things.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) enlarged, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) were talking to himself, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) very great
courage and resource at all times. The thing was so evident in the
man's mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never even changed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) described how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
bested his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemies, or forgiven them, exactly as they had bested or
forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in those careless days; how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had entreated, cajoled, and
bullied towns, companies, and syndicates, all for their enduring good;
crawled round, through, or under mountains and ravines, dragging a
string and hoop-iron railroad after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and in the end, how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sat
still while promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
character to shreds.

<p/>The tale held Harvey almost breathless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) head a little cocked to one
side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) eyes fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) father's face, as the twilight deepened and
the red cigar-end lit up the furrowed cheeks and heavy eyebrows. It
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) like watching a locomotive storming across country in the
dark--a mile between each glare of the opened fire-door: but this
locomotive could talk, and the words shook and stirred the boy to the
core of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soul. At last Cheyne pitched away the cigar-butt, and the
two sat in the dark over the lapping water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never told that to any one before,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father.

<p/>Harvey gasped. <div class="bookquote">``It's just the greatest thing that ever was!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I got. Now I'm coming to what I didn't get. It won't sound
much of anything to you, but I don't wish you to be as old as I am
before you find out. I can handle men, of course, and I'm no fool along
my own lines, but--but I can't compete with the man who has been
taught! I've picked up as I went along, and I guess it sticks out all
over me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never seen it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son, indignantly.

<p/>``You will, though, Harve. You will--just as soon as you're through
college. Don't I know it? Don't I know the look on men's faces when
they think me a--a ``mucker,<div class="bookquote">'' as they call it out here? I can break them
to little pieces--yes--but I can't get back at 'em to hurt 'em where
they live. I don't say they're `way, `way up, but I feel I'm `way,
`way, `way off, somehow. Now you've got your chance. You've got to soak
up all the learning that's around, and you'll live with a crowd that
are doing the same thing. They'll be doing it for a few thousand
dollars a year at most; but remember you'll be doing it for millions.
You'll learn law enough to look after your own property when I'm out o'
the light, and you'll have to be solid with the best men in the market
-LRB-they are useful later-RRB-; and above all, you'll have to stow away the
plain, common, sit-down-with-your-chin-on-your-elbows book-learning.
Nothing pays like that, Harve, and it's bound to pay more and more each
year in our country--in business and in politics. You'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no sugar my end of the deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey. <div class="bookquote">``Four years at
college! Wish I'd chosen the valet and the yacht!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Cheyne insisted. <div class="bookquote">``You're investing your capital
where it'll bring in the best returns; and I guess you won't find our
property shrunk any when you're ready to take hold. Think it over, and
let me know in the morning. Hurry! We'll be late for supper!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>As this was a business talk, there was no need for Harvey to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
mother about it; and Cheyne naturally took the same point of view. But
Mrs. Cheyne saw and feared, and was a little jealous. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) boy, who rode
rough-shod over her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>), was gone, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stead reigned a keen-faced
youth, abnormally silent, who addressed most of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) conversation to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) understood it was business, and therefore a matter beyond
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) premises. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) had any doubts, they were resolved when Cheyne
went to Boston and brought back a new diamond marquise-ring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you two men been doing now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) said, with a weak little
smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) turned it in the light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Talking--just talking, mama; there's nothing mean about Harvey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was not. The boy had made a treaty on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own account. Railroads,
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) explained gravely, interested him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as little as lumber, real estate,
or mining. What his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soul yearned after was control of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's
newly purchased sailing-ships. If that could be promised him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) within
what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) conceived to be a reasonable time, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) part, guaranteed
diligence and sobriety at college for four or five years. In vacation
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was to be allowed full access to all details connected with the
line,--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had asked not more than two thousand questions about
it,--from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's most private papers in the safe to the tug in
San Francisco harbour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne at the last. <div class="bookquote">``You'll alter your mind twenty
times before you leave college, o' course; but if you take hold of it
in proper shape, and if you don't tie it up before you're twenty-three,
I'll make the thing over to you. How's that, Harve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nope; never pays to split up a going concern There's too much
competition in the world anyway, and Disko says `blood-kin hev to stick
together.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) crowd never go back on him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>). That's one reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) says,
why they make such big fares. Say, the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''  (<font color='red'><b>Georges</b></font>)</div>goes off to the
Georges on Monday. They don't stay long ashore, do they?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we ought to be going, too, I guess. I've left my business hung
up at loose ends between two oceans, and it's time to connect again. I
just hate to do it, though; haven't had a holiday like this for twenty
years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't go without seeing Disko off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Harvey; <div class="bookquote">``and Monday's
Memorial Day. Let's stay over that, anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this memorial business? They were talking about it at the
boarding-house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne, weakly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>), too, was not anxious to spoil
the golden days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as far as I can make out, this business is a sort of
song-and-dance act, whacked up for the summer boarders. Disko don't
think much of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>boarders</b></font>) says, because they take up a collection for the
widows and orphans. Disko's independent. Haven't you noticed that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--yes. A little. In spots. Is it a town show, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The summer convention is. They read out the names of the fellows
drowned or gone astray since last time, and they make speeches, and
recite, and all. Then, Disko says, the secretaries of the Aid Societies
go into the back yard and fight over the catch. The real show, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) says,
is in the spring. The ministers all take a hand then, and there aren't
any summer boarders around.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne, with the brilliant and perfect comprehension of
one born into and bred up to city pride. <div class="bookquote">``We'll stay over for Memorial
Day, and get off in the afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess I'll go down to Disko's and make him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bring his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) crowd up before
they sail. I'll have to stand with them, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's it, is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne. <div class="bookquote">``I'm only a poor summer boarder,
and you're--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Banker--full-blooded Banker,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey called back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) boarded a
trolley, and Cheyne went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) blissful dreams for the future.

<p/>Disko had no use for public functions where appeals were made for
charity, but Harvey pleaded that the glory of the day would be lost, so
far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was concerned, if the <div class="bookquote">``We're Heres''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>absented themselves. Then
Disko made conditions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had heard--it was astonishing how all the
world knew all the world's business along the waterfront--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had heard
that a <div class="bookquote">``Philadelphia actress-woman''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was going to take part in the
exercises; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) mistrusted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) would deliver <div class="bookquote">``Skipper Ireson's
Ride.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Personally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had as little use for actresses as for summer
boarders; but justice was justice, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) himself -LRB-here Dan
giggled-RRB- had once slipped up on a matter of judgment, this thing must
not be. So Harvey came back to East Gloucester, and spent half a day
explaining to an amused actress with a royal reputation on two
seaboards the inwardness of the mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) contemplated; and she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>)
admitted that it was justice, even as Disko had said.

<p/>Cheyne knew by old experience what would happen; but anything of the
nature of a public palaver was meat and drink to the man's soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw
the trolleys hurrying west, in the hot, hazy morning, full of women in
light summer dresses, and white-faced straw-hatted men fresh from
Boston desks; the stack of bicycles outside the post-office; the
come-and-go of busy officials, greeting one another; the slow flick and
swash of bunting in the heavy air; and the important man with a hose
sluicing the brick sidewalk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``don't you remember--after Seattle was
burned out--and they got her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) going again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Cheyne nodded, and looked critically down the crooked street. Like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) understood these gatherings, all the West over, and
compared them one against another. The fishermen began to mingle with
the crowd about the town-hall doors--blue-jowled Portuguese, their
women bare-headed or shawled for the most part; clear-eyed Nova
Scotians, and men of the Maritime Provinces; French, Italians, Swedes,
and Danes, with outside crews of coasting schooners; and everywhere
women in black, who saluted one another with a gloomy pride, for this
was their day of great days. And there were ministers of many
creeds,--pastors of great, gilt-edged congregations, at the seaside for
a rest, with shepherds of the regular work,--from the priests of the
Church on the Hill to bush-bearded ex-sailor Lutherans, hail-fellow
with the men of a score of boats. There were owners of lines of
schooners, large contributors to the societies, and small men, their
few craft pawned to the mastheads, with bankers and marine-insurance
agents, captains of tugs and water-boats, riggers, fitters, lumpers,
salters, boat-builders, and coopers, and all the mixed population of
the water-front.

<p/>They drifted along the line of seats made gay with the dresses of the
summer boarders, and one of the town officials patrolled and perspired
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Lutherans</b></font>) shone all over with pure civic pride. Cheyne had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) for
five minutes a few days before, and between the two there was entire
understanding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Cheyne, and what d'you think of our city?--Yes, madam, you
can sit anywhere you please.--You have this kind of thing out West, I
presume?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but we aren't as old as you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so, of course. You ought to have been at the exercises when we
celebrated our two hundred and fiftieth birthday. I tell you, Mr.
Cheyne, the old city did herself credit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I heard. It pays, too. What's the matter with the town that it
don't have a first-class hotel, though?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right over there to the left, Pedro. Heaps o' room for you and your
crowd.--Why, that's what I tell 'em all the time, Mr. Cheyne. There's
big money in it, but I presume that don't affect you any. What we want
is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the skipper</b></font>)</div><p/>A heavy hand fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) broadcloth shoulder, and the flushed skipper
of a Portland coal-and-ice coaster spun him (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) half round. ``What in
thunder do you fellows mean by clappin' the law on the town when all
decent men are at sea this way? Heh? Town's dry's a bone, an' smells a
sight worse sence I quit. <div class="bookquote">``Might ha' left us one saloon for soft
drinks, anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't seem to have hindered your nourishment this morning, Carsen.
I'll go into the politics of it later. Sit down by the door and think
over your arguments till I come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What good's arguments to me? In Miquelon champagne's eighteen dollars
a case, and--''  (<font color='red'><b>The skipper</b></font>)</div>The skipper lurched into his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) seat as an organ-prelude
silenced him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our new organ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said the official proudly to Cheyne. <div class="bookquote">``Cost us four
thousand dollars, too. We'll have to get back to high-licence next year
to pay for it. I wasn't going to let the ministers have all the
religion at their convention. Those are some of our orphans standing up
to sing. My wife taught 'em. See you again later, Mr. Cheyne. I'm
wanted on the platform.''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>High, clear, and true, children's voices bore down the last noise of
those settling into their places.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O all ye Works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and magnify
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) for ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div><p/>The women throughout the hall leaned forward to look as the reiterated
cadences filled the air. Mrs. Cheyne, with some others, began to
breathe short; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) had hardly imagined there were so many widows in the
world; and instinctively searched for Harvey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) had found the <div class="bookquote">``We're
Heres''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>at the back of the audience, and was standing, as by right,
between Dan and Disko. Uncle Salters, returned the night before with
Penn, from Pamlico Sound, received him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) suspiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hain't your folk gone yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) grunted. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doin' here,
young feller?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O ye Seas and Floods, bless ye the Lord: praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and magnify him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hain't he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) good right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s bin there, same as the rest of
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in them clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Salters snarled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut your head, Salters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko. <div class="bookquote">``Your bile's gone back on you.
Stay right where ye are, Harve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the orator</b></font>)</div><p/>Then up and spoke the orator of the occasion, another pillar of the
municipality, bidding the world welcome to Gloucester, and incidentally
pointing out wherein Gloucester excelled the rest of the world. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)
turned to the sea-wealth of the city, and spoke of the price that must
be paid for the yearly harvest. They would hear later the names of
their lost dead--one hundred and seventeen of them. -LRB-The widows stared
a little, and looked at one another here.-RRB- Gloucester could not boast
any overwhelming mills or factories. Her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) sons worked for such wage as
the sea gave; and they all knew that neither Georges nor the Banks were
cow-pastures. The utmost that folk ashore could accomplish was to help
the widows and the orphans; and after a few general remarks he (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) took
this opportunity of thanking, in the name of the city, those who had so
public-spiritedly consented to participate in the exercises of the
occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I jest despise the beggin' pieces in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>growled Disko. <div class="bookquote">``It don't
give folk a fair notion of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>returned Salters, <div class="bookquote">``it stands in the nature o' things they hev to be

 (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to lose everything--everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Penn. <div class="bookquote">``What can you do then?
Once!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--the watery blue eyes stared up and down, as looking for
something to steady them--<div class="bookquote">``once I read--in a book, I think--of a boat
where every one was run down--except some one--and he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) said to me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shucks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Salters, cutting in. <div class="bookquote">``You read a little less an' take

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey, jammed among the fishermen, felt a creepy, crawly, tingling
thrill that began in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) neck and ended at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) boots. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)
was cold, too, though it was a stifling day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`That the actress from Philadelphia?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Disko Troop, scowling at
the platform. <div class="bookquote">``You've fixed it about old man Ireson, hain't ye, Harve?
Ye know why naow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not <div class="bookquote">``Ireson's Ride''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman sort</b></font>)</div>that the woman delivered, but some sort of
poem about a fishing-port called Brixham and a fleet of trawlers
beating in against storm by night, while the women made a guiding fire
at the head of the quay with everything they could lay hands on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They took the grandam's blanket,
Who shivered and bade them go;
They took the baby's cradle,
Who could not say them no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whew!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, peering over Long Jack's shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``That's great!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ground-hog case,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Galway man</b></font>)</div>said the Galway man. <div class="bookquote">``Badly lighted port, Danny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And knew not all the while

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>The wonderful voice took hold of people by their heartstrings; and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told how the drenched crews were flung ashore, living and dead, and
they carried the bodies to the glare of the fires, asking: <div class="bookquote">``Child, is
this your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>the crews</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Wife, is this your man?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>you could hear hard
breathing all over the benches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when the boats of Brixham

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was very little applause when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finished. The women were
looking for their handkerchiefs, and many of the men stared at the
ceiling with shiny eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Salters; ``that `u'd cost ye a dollar to hear at any

Edwardes strike adrift here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No keepin' him (<font color='blue'><b>Edwardes</b></font>) under,''  (<font color='red'><b>an Eastport man</b></font>)</div>said an Eastport man behind. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edwardes</b></font>)'s a poet, an'
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edwardes</b></font>)'s baound to say his (<font color='blue'><b>Edwardes</b></font>) piece. <div class="bookquote">``Comes from daown aour way, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not say that Captain B. Edwardes had striven for five
consecutive years to be allowed to recite a piece of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
composition on Gloucester Memorial Day. An amused and exhausted
committee had at last given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desire. The simplicity and utter
happiness of the old man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very best Sunday
clothes, won the audience ere he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth. They sat unmurmuring
through seven-and-thirty hatchet-made verses describing at fullest
length the loss of the schooner Joan Hasken off the Georges in the gale
of 1867, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) came to an end they shouted with one kindly throat.

<p/>A far-sighted Boston reporter slid away for a full copy of the epic and
an interview with the author; so that earth had nothing more to offer
Captain Bart Edwardes, ex-whaler, shipwright, master-fisherman, and
poet, in the seventy-third year of his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) age.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naow, I call that sensible,''  (<font color='red'><b>an Eastport man</b></font>)</div>said an Eastport man. <div class="bookquote">``I've bin over that
graound with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edwardes</b></font>) writin', jest as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edwardes</b></font>) read it, in my two hands, and I
can testify that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edwardes</b></font>)'s got it all in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Dan here couldn't do better'n that with one hand before breakfast,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) ought to be switched,''  (<font color='red'><b>Salters/Uncle Salters</b></font>)</div>said Salters, upholding the honour of
Massachusetts on general principles. <div class="bookquote">``Not but what I'm free to own he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>)'s
considerable litt`ery--fer Maine. Still--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess Uncle Salters's goin' to die this trip. Fust compliment he (<font color='blue'><b>Salters</b></font>)'s
ever paid me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>Dan sniggered. <div class="bookquote">``What's wrong with you, Harve? You act
all quiet and you look greenish. Feelin' sick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know what's the matter with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Harvey replied. <div class="bookquote">``Seems if my
insides were too big for my outsides. I'm all crowded up and shivery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dispepsy? Pshaw-too bad. We'll wait for the readin', an' then we'll
quit, an' catch the tide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The widows all</b></font>)</div><p/>The widows--they were nearly all of that season's making--braced
themselves rigidly like people going to be shot in cold blood, for they
knew what was coming. The summer-boarder girls in pink and blue
shirt-waists stopped tittering over Captain Edwardes's wonderful poem,
and looked back to see why all was silent. The fishermen pressed
forward as that town official who had talked with Cheyne bobbed up on
the platform and began to read the year's list of losses, dividing them
into months. Last September's casualties were mostly single men and
strangers, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) voice rang very loud in the stillness of the hall.

<p/>``September 9th.--Schooner ``Florrie Anderson'' lost, with all aboard, off
the Georges. ``Reuben Pitman, master, 50, single, Main Street, City.
``Emil Olsen, 19, single, 329 Hammond Street, City; Denmark. ``Oscar
Stanberg, single, 25, Sweden. ``Carl Stanberg, single, 28, Main Street,
City. ``Pedro, supposed Madeira, single, Keene's boarding-house, City.
<div class="bookquote">``Joseph Welsh, alias Joseph Wright, 30, St. John's, Newfoundland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--Augusty, Maine,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a voice cried from the body of the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shipped from St. John's,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>said the reader, looking to see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) belongs in Augusty. My nevvy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reader</b></font>)</div><p/>The reader made a pencilled correction on the margin of the list, and
resumed:

<p/>``Same schooner, Charlie Ritchie, Liverpool, Nova Scotia, 33, single.
``Albert May, 267 Rogers Street, City, 27, single. <div class="bookquote">``September
27th.--Orvin Dollard, 30, married, drowned in dory off Eastern Point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widows</b></font>)</div><p/>That shot went home, for one of the widows flinched where she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) sat,
clasping and unclasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) hands. Mrs. Cheyne, who had been listening
with wide-opened eyes, threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) head and choked. Dan's mother, a
few seats to the right, saw and heard and quickly moved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) side.
The reading went on. By the time they reached the January and February
wrecks the shots were falling thick and fast, and the widows drew
breath between their teeth.

<p/>``February 14th.--Schooner <div class="bookquote">``Harry Randolph''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>dismasted on the way home
from Newfoundland; Asa Musie, married, 32, Main Street, City, lost
overboard.

<p/>``February 23d.--Schooner ``Gilbert Hope<div class="bookquote">''; went astray in
dory, Robert Beavon, 29, married, native of Pubnico, Nova Scotia.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Gilbert</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) wife was in the hall. They heard a low cry, as though a little
animal had been hit. It was stifled at once, and a girl staggered out
of the hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been hoping against hope for months, because some
who have gone adrift in dories have been miraculously picked up by
deep-sea sailing-ships. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) certainty, and Harvey could see
the policeman on the sidewalk hailing a hack for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's fifty cents
to the depot'' (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>--the driver began, but the policeman held up his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)
hand--<div class="bookquote">``but I'm goin' there anyway. Jump right in. Look at here, Alf;
you don't pull me next time my lamps ain't lit. See?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div><p/>The side-door closed on the patch of bright sunshine, and Harvey's eyes
turned again to the reader and his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) endless list.

<p/>``April 19th.--Schooner ``Mamie Douglas'' lost on the Banks with all
hands. ``Edward Canton,'' 43, master, married, City. ``D. Hawkins,'' alias
Williams, 34, married, Shelbourne, Nova Scotia. ``G. W. Clay,<div class="bookquote">'' coloured,
28, married, City.''

 (<font color='red'><b>G. W. Clay</b></font>)</div><p/>And so on, and so on. Great lumps were rising in Harvey's throat, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) stomach reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) of the day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) fell from the liner.

<p/>``May 10th.--Schooner ``We're Here<div class="bookquote">'' -LSB-the blood tingled all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)-RSB-.
Otto Svendson, 20, single, City, lost overboard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more a low, tearing cry from somewhere at the back of the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) shouldn't ha' come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) shouldn't ha' come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Long Jack/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Long Jack, with
a cluck of pity. <div class="bookquote">``Don't scrowge, Harve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>grunted Dan. Harvey heard that
much, but the rest was all darkness spotted with fiery wheels. Disko
leaned forward and spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) wife, where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat with one arm round
Mrs. Cheyne, and the other holding down the snatching, catching, ringed
hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lean your head daown--right daown!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``It'll go off in a
minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ca-an`t! I do-don`t! Oh, let me--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cheyne</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Cheyne did not at all know
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Troop repeated. ``Your boy's jest fainted dead away.
They do that some when they're gettin' their growth. <div class="bookquote">``Wish to tend to
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? We can git aout this side. Quite quiet. You come right along with
me. Psha', my dear, we're both women, I guess. We must tend to aour
men-folk. Come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The <div class="bookquote">``We're Heres''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>promptly went through the crowd as a body-guard, and
it was a very white and shaken Harvey that they propped up on a bench
in an anteroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Favours his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ma,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>was Mrs. Troop's only comment, as the mother bent
over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How d'you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could ever stand it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried indignantly to
Cheyne, who had said nothing at all. <div class="bookquote">``It was horrible--horrible! We
shouldn't have come. It's wrong and wicked! It--it isn't right!
Why--why couldn't they put these things in the papers, where they
belong? Are you better, darling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>That made Harvey very properly ashamed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm all right, I guess,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) said, struggling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) feet, with a broken giggle. <div class="bookquote">``Must ha' been
something I ate for breakfast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Coffee, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>said Cheyne, whose face was all in hard lines, as
though it had been cut out of bronze. <div class="bookquote">``We won't go back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess `twould be `baout's well to git daown to the wharf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>said Disko.
<div class="bookquote">``It's close in along with them Dagoes, an' the fresh air will fresh
Mrs. Cheyne up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div><p/>Harvey announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) never felt better in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) life; but it was not
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) saw the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, fresh from the lumper's hands, at
Wouverman's wharf, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) all-overish feelings in a queer
mixture of pride and sorrowfulness. Other people--summer boarders and
such-like--played about in cat-boats or looked at the sea from
pier-heads; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) understood things from the inside--more things than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) could begin to think about. None the less, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) could have sat down
and howled because the little schooner was going off. Mrs. Cheyne
simply cried and cried every step of the way, and said most
extraordinary things to Mrs. Troop, who <div class="bookquote">``babied''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cheyne</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) till Dan, who had
not been <div class="bookquote">``babied''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>since he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was six, whistled aloud.

<p/>And so the old crowd--Harvey felt like the most ancient of
mariners--dropped into the old schooner among the battered dories,
while Harvey slipped the stern-fast from the pier-head, and they slid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) along the wharf-side with their hands. Every one wanted to say so
much that no one said anything in particular. Harvey bade Dan take care
of Uncle Salters's sea-boots and Penn's dory-anchor, and Long Jack
entreated Harvey to remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lessons in seamanship; but the jokes
fell flat in the presence of the two women, and it is hard to be funny
with green harbour-water widening between good friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Up jib and fores`l!''  (<font color='red'><b>Disko/Disko Troop</b></font>)</div>shouted Disko, getting to the wheel, as the wind
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``See you later, Harve. Dunno but I come near thinkin' a heap
o' you an' your folks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) glided beyond ear-shot, and they sat down to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Cheyne</b></font>) up the
harbour. And still Mrs. Cheyne wept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha', my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Troop; <div class="bookquote">``we're both women, I guess. Like's
not it'll ease your heart to hev your cry aout. God He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows it never
done me a mite o' good; but then He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows I've had something to cry
fer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Now it was a few years later, and upon the other edge of America, that
a young man came through the clammy sea-fog up a windy street which is
flanked with most expensive houses built of wood to imitate stone. To
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was standing by a hammered iron gate, entered on
horseback--and the horse would have been cheap at a thousand
dollars--another young man. And this is what they said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Dan!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Harve!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the best with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm so's to be that kind o' animal called second mate this trip.
Ain't you most through with that triple-invoiced college o' yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Getting that way. I tell you, the Leland Stanford Junior isn't a
circumstance to the old ``We're Here<div class="bookquote">''; but I'm coming into the business
for keeps next fall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meanin' aour packets?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing else. You just wait till I get my knife into you, Dan. I'm
going to make the old line lie down and cry when I take hold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll resk it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, with a brotherly grin, as Harvey dismounted
and asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) were coming in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I took the cable fer; but, say, is the doctor anywheres
araound? I'll draown that crazy nigger some day, his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) one cussed joke
an' all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a low, triumphant chuckle, as the ex-cook of the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>came out of the fog to take the horse's bridle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) allowed no one but
himself to attend to any of Harvey's wants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thick as the Banks, ain't it, doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan, propitiatingly.

<p/>But the coal-black Celt with the second-sight did not see fit to reply
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Celt</b></font>) had tapped Dan on the shoulder, and for the twentieth time
croaked the old, old prophecy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) ear:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master--man. Man--master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>). ``You remember, Dan Troop, what I
said? On the <div class="bookquote">``We're Here'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't go so far as to deny that it do look like it as things
stand at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dan/Dan Troop</b></font>)</div>said Dan. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was an able packet, and one way an'
another I owe her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) a heap--her (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) and dad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harvey/Cheyne/Harvey Cheyne</b></font>)</div>quoth Harvey Cheyne.
